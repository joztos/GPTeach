Foreword
Foreword to the First Edition
T
his is a very special and important book. I say that at the outset because the 
book is written with such grace and gentleness, with such clarity and directness, 
that you will know that David Kolb has written an excellent treatise on learning 
theory, certainly for educators and quite possibly for Educated Persons, whatever that 
means. But as you read on—as I read on, I had to catch my breath every once in a while, 
wondering if the velocity of my excitement would ever cease.
Kolb has written a wonderful book, one I’ve been waiting for—without quite realizing 
it—for a long time. It’s a book (I’m only guessing here) that he took a very, very long time 
to write, since it is crafted so carefully and is so deeply nuanced that you are certain that 
it’s been filtered and re-set and redrafted many times, like a precious stone, turned and 
polished into a lapidary’s gem.
Why this excitement? Well, the hyper-ventilation I alluded to above is based on Kolb’s 
achievement in providing the missing link between theory and practice, between the 
abstract generalization and the concrete instance, between the affective and cognitive 
domains. By this BIG achievement he demonstrates conclusively—and is the first to do 
so—that learning is a social process based on carefully cultivated experience which chal-
lenges every precept and concept of what nowadays passes for “teaching.” And with this 
major achievement he knowingly shifts the ecology of learning away from the exclusiv-
ity of the classroom (and its companion, the Lecture) to the workplace, the family, the 
carpool, the community, or wherever we gather to work or play or love.
The significance for educators is profound because, among other things, Kolb leads us 
(again, so gently) away from the traditional concerns of credit hours and calendar time 
toward competence, working knowledge, and information truly pertinent to jobs, fami-
lies, and communities.
The book is no “piece of cake.” Despite its graceful aesthetic and illuminating dia-
grams, from mandalas to tight-lipped 2 × 2 tables that management professors love to 
show on the overhead screen, the author takes us on a fascinating but densely written 
journey in and around some of the most seminal thinkers who laid the foundations of 
 “experience-based learning”—great minds such as Dewey, Lewin, and Piaget. Nor does 
he neglect other auxiliary players like Maslow, Rogers, and Erikson. Aside from creat-
ing a framework that removes whatever residual guilt those of us have felt or feel when 
using experience-based learning within the formal classroom boundaries, Kolb provides 
xi
Foreword   
a thick texture of understanding by building his framework on the wonderful armatures 
of that trinity: Dewey, Lewin and Piaget.
As I say, this is an important book, one the field has been waiting for, worth every ounce 
of energy it takes to read. But, because of its revolutionary undertones, read it at your 
own risk. For each reader must take the risk of creating a life of his or her own. When 
you think about it, you are the thread that holds the events of your life together. That’s 
what Kolb gets us to understand.

About the Author
David Kolb is the Chairman of Experience Based Learning Systems (EBLS), an organiza-
tion that he founded in 1980 to advance research and practice on experiential learning. 
EBLS conducts basic research on Experiential Learning Theory and has developed many 
experiential exercises and self-assessment instruments including the latest Kolb Learning 
Style Inventory 4.0. The EBLS program of research on experiential learning is ongoing 
in collaboration with an international network of researchers, practitioners and learning 
partners.
He received his BA in psychology, philosophy, and religion at Knox College and his 
Ph.D. in Social Psychology from Harvard University. He was a professor of organiza-
tional behavior and management at the MIT Sloan School of Management and at the 
Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University, where he is

Preface 
To the Revised Edition
T
his revised edition of Experiential Learning is the most comprehensive and up to 
date statement of experiential learning theory (ELT), a work that marks the cen-
terpiece of my 50-year academic career. My involvement with experiential learn-
ing has been one of the most stimulating and rewarding associations of my adult life. As I 
described in the 1st edition, I didn’t create experiential learning theory, but discovered it 
in the works of prominent twentieth-century scholars who gave experience a central role 
in their theories of human learning and development—notably John Dewey, Kurt Lewin, 
Jean Piaget, Lev Vygotsky, William James, Carl Jung, Paulo Freire, Carl Rogers, and Mary 
Parker Follett. The rewards of this long involvement have been multifaceted, ranging 
from the discovery of an intellectual perspective on human learning and development 
that is at once pragmatic and humanistic, to techniques of experience-based education 
that have added vitality to my teaching and to a perspective on adult development that 
has influenced my own personal growth and development as well as others.
I have been sustained and inspired in my work by a growing network of thousands of col-
leagues in over 30 academic disciplines from all over the world who share my excitement 
about experiential learning. Each year I have the pleasure of reviewing 300–400 research 
articles that have cited Experiential Learning and other ELT-related research papers for 
inclusion in the Experiential Learning Theory Bibliography (Kolb and Kolb, 2014). The 
scope of this work is broad and innovative, making immeasurable contributions to expe-
riential learning theory research and practice. More personally, it is a source of endless 
inspiration for my own work. Even deeper satisfaction has come from supervising well 
over a hundred theses and Ph.D. dissertations at MIT and Case Western Reserve Univer-
sity and consulting with many other similar scholars at institutions around the world. I 
am filled with gratitude and admiration for the multiyear commitment they have made 
to advancing experiential learning theory. Engaging in the “nitty gritty” of ELT research 
as part of the dissertation process has given us the opportunity to explore theoretical, 
methodological, and practical issues in great depth and has produced lifelong friend-
ships as well. Some of these scholars have carried research work on experiential learning 
forward into their own distinguished careers. 
The Plan for This Revised Edition
I have chosen to keep the text of the first edition intact and add research updates and 
reflections at the end of each chapter. In this way the original text and theoretical state-
ment of Experiential Learning is preserved and differentiated from the contemporary 
xiv 
Preface
additions. The Update and Reflections (U&R) sections of the chapters include devel-
opments in experiential learning theory research and theory since the publication of 
the first edition of Experiential Learning as well as my reflections on critical reviews of 
experiential learning theory and on theoretical issues raised by other research since the 
1984 book.
Part I, “Experience and Learning,” begins in Chapter 1 with a review of the history of 
experiential learning as it emerged in the works of Dewey, Lewin, and Piaget. It includes 
an analysis of the contemporary applications of experiential learning theory in educa-
tion, organization development, management development, and adult development. The 
Chapter 1 Update and Reflections adds other foundational scholars of experiential learn-
ing and their particular contributions to experiential learning theory. The communalities 
among these scholars in their theories, methods, and careers are examined. 
Chapter 2 compares the learning models of Dewey, Lewin, and Piaget and identifies 
the common themes that characterize the experiential learning process. The Chapter 2 
Update and Reflections examines the process aspects of experiential learning with par-
ticular focus on the learning cycle. It explores the connections between learning and life 
in the concept of “autopoesis” developed by Maturana and Varela. Parallels between this 
spiral of life and the spiral of learning from experience are examined. Misunderstandings 
and critiques of the learning cycle and its application are also examined.
Part II, “The Structure of Learning and Knowledge,” begins in Chapter 3 with a struc-
tured model of the learning process depicting two basic dimensions—a prehension or 
“grasping” dimension and a transformation dimension. Philosophical, physiological, and 
psychological evidence for this model are reviewed. The Chapter 3 Update and Reflec-
tions examines recent research on the brain and its links with the learning cycle, with 
particular emphasis on the work of James Zull.
Chapter 4 focuses on individuality in learning with the development of a typology of 
learning styles based on the structural model of learning presented in Chapter 3. Assess-
ment of individual learning styles with the Learning Style Inventory is described. Data 
are presented relating individual learning styles to personality type, educational special-
ization, professional career, current job, and adaptive competencies. In the Chapter 4 
Update and Reflections, the latest Kolb Learning Style Inventory 4.0 with nine learning 
styles and the assessment of learning flexibility will be examined in the context of the 
concept of conceptions of the self and individuality.
Chapter 5 presents a typology of social knowledge structures—formism, contextualism, 
mechanism, and organicism—and relates these knowledge structures to academic fields 
of study and career paths. The Chapter 5 Update and Reflections examines research on 
the spiral of knowledge creation with particular emphasis on tacit knowledge. The latest 
research on Pepper’s world hypotheses is examined with its implications for disciplinary 
learning spaces.
xv
Preface 
Part III, “Learning and Development,” begins in Chapter 6 with a statement of the expe-
riential learning theory of development wherein adult development is portrayed in three 
stages—acquisition, specialization, and integration. The chapter describes how conscious 
experience changes through these developmental stages via higher levels of learning. The 
Chapter 6 Update and Reflections examines the latest research on adult development and 
its implication for ELT development theory. 
Chapter 7 documents specialization as the major developmental process in higher edu-
cation. It describes the knowledge structures of different fields of study and the con-
sequences of matches and mismatches between student learning styles. Relationships 
between professional education and later career adaptation are also examined. The 
section called “managing the learning process” describes applications of experiential 
learning theory to teaching and administration. The Chapter 7 Update and Reflections 
describes our latest research on learning spaces and educator roles involved in teaching 
around the learning cycle and the assessment and development of learning skills. 
Chapter 8 describes the challenges of integrative development in adulthood by examin-
ing the life structures of integrated and adaptively flexible individuals. Integrity is posed 
as the pinnacle of development, conceived as the highest form of learning. The Chapter 
8 Update and Reflections focuses on lifelong learning and the learning way; describing 
how learners can use practices of deliberate experiential learning to respond to a chang-
ing world where lifelong learning is the norm.

evisiting Experiential Learning after 30 years to prepare this second edition is 
a great pleasure for me. The book has been the centerpiece of my career as a 
scholar. Try as I might to escape it, inquiry about experiential learning has con-
tinued to inspire and fascinate, always drawing me back to explore new questions and 
ideas. Heidegger said that any thinker has but one central thought in life, one essential 
intuition, and I guess experiential learning is mine. 
I still remember vividly the experience that gave rise to my intuition about the power 
of experience in learning. It was in the summer of 1966 at a two week T-group at the 
National Training Laboratory in Bethel, Maine. Early in the morning that began the 
second week, I was standing on the porch of the old Victorian house where we held our 
meetings. The sun was rising through the trees bringing its warmth to the morning chill. 
Its light bathed the woods in a golden glow that seemed to emanate from everything it 
struck. The surreal vividness of the scene was matched by the intensity of my emotions as 
I marveled at the closeness I felt to my group members who only a week before had been 
total strangers. We had shared our life stories with one another, but more powerfully had 
experienced one another deeply in the here-and-now. I had experienced a transforma-
tion in myself and witnessed transformation in others flowing from the contact. I was so 
eager to begin our next week together. The scene before me became blurred and sparkled 
like crystal as my eyes teared up in the sun. Fully experiencing such intense emotion was 
not typical for me, and it highlighted my sense that there was magic in the sensitivity 
training model of group dynamics that Kurt Lewin and his associates had created (see 
Chapter 1, p. 10).

Introduction
I resolved to learn more and thus began a lifetime of inquiry into experiential learning. 
That fall my colleagues and I began experimenting with T-groups in our introductory 
course on Organizational Behavior at MIT’s Sloan School of Management. Later we used 
them in our Peace Corps training programs. In both cases, these efforts met with mixed 
results in spite of our persistent attempts. While some students and trainees “got it” and 
were as profoundly influenced by their experience as I was, for many it was more about 
“emotional intelligence” than they were ready for. The lack of structure and deviation 
from the traditional classroom learning process they were accustomed to was too confus-
ing for them to get much from the unstructured groups.
These difficulties spurred us to reflect more deeply in a search for a way to extract the 
“active experiential learning ingredient” that made these groups so powerful, and harness 
it to produce a more effective learning process. What we extracted was the experiential 
learning cycle based on Lewin’s laboratory method. T-groups were typically introduced 
by saying, “We are going to share experiences together, reflect and share their meaning 
for us and together think about the implications for or group. From this understanding 
we can act to create the kind of group we want.” We ask ourselves if this learning cycle 
might be a way to structure learning experiences.
For me this marked the beginning of my research based on the works of those who I have 
come to call the Foundational Scholars of Experiential Learning—William James, Kurt 
Lewin, John Dewey, Jean Piaget, Lev Vygotsky, Carl Jung, Carl Rogers, Paulo Freire, and 
Mary Parker Follett. I chose the word “experiential” to describe a particular perspec-
tive on the learning process that originated in the work of these scholars of experiential 
learning (see Chapter 1 Update and Reflections). Some have suggested that the term 
experiential learning is redundant since learning itself is generally conceived to be the 
result of experience as opposed to genetics, biological development, or instinct (e.g., 
Fenwick, 2003). However, the behaviorist approaches to the study of learning that domi-
nated psychology in the first half of the twentieth century reduced objective experience 
to reinforcements and denied any role for subjective conscious experience in learning. 
The foundational scholars all stood at the margins of this dominant tradition placing 
subjective, conscious, and intentional experiencing at the center of the learning process. 
In Experiential Learning, I developed Experiential Learning Theory (ELT) to integrate 
the common themes in their work into a systematic framework that can address twenty-
first century problems of learning and education. My intention was to describe a theo-
retical perspective on the individual learning process that applied in all situations and 
arenas of life. Experiential learning theory was developed following Lewin’s plan for the 
creation of scientific knowledge by conceptualizing phenomena through formal, explicit, 
testable theory. In his approach, “before a system can be fully useful the concepts in it 
have to be defined in a way that (1) permits the treatment of both the qualitative and 
quantitative aspects of phenomena in a single system, (2) adequately represents the 
 conditional-genetic (or causal) attributes of phenomena, (3) facilitates the  measurement 
xviii Introduction
 (or operational definition) of these attributes, and (4) allows both generalization to uni-
versal laws and concrete treatment of the individual case” (Cartwright, 1951, p. ix). 
Having studied experiential learning for nearly 50 years, my views have evolved and 
deepened but not changed substantially. In many ways I have moved forward by moving 
backward, studying more deeply the works of the foundational scholars, recalling the line 
of T. S. Eliot at the beginning of Chapter 2, “We shall not cease from exploration. And 
the end of all our exploring. Will be to arrive where we started. And know the place for 
the first time.” In revisiting Experiential Learning for this second edition, I cannot say 
that I know it definitively, but I can see that countless cycles through the learning spiral 
have deepened and expanded my views about learning and development.
What Is Experiential Learning?
The most important of these spirals of learning was a continuing inquiry into the nature 
of experience and the process of learning from it. The research literature on experiential 
learning contains much confusion and debate about its meaning. My inquiry took me 
back to William James’ (1912) creation of the philosophy of radical empiricism in a 
search for an epistemological perspective that would help explain the ELT meaning of 
experiential learning and clarify the differences with other uses of the term. If I were to 
rewrite Experiential Learning today, I would promote James to equal status with Dewey, 
Lewin, and Piaget in the book. My further study of his work (James, 1912; Taylor and 
Wozniak, 1996) after its publication revealed in radical empiricism an epistemological 
foundation for experiential learning theory and a detailed analysis of the role of experi-
ence in learning. His description of the learning cycle (see Chapter 1 Update and Reflec-
tions, page 24) may well have been the first.
Experiential learning as an Educational technique  
or type of learning 
A common usage of the term “experiential learning” defines it as a particular form of 
learning from life experience; often contrasted it with lecture and classroom learning. 
Keeton and Tate (1978) offered this definition, “Learning in which the learner is directly 
in touch with the realities being studied. It is contrasted with the learner who only reads 
about, hears about, talks about, or writes about these realities but never comes into con-
tact with them as part of the learning process.” In this view of experiential learning, the 
emphasis is often on direct sense experience and in-context action as the primary source 
of learning, often down-playing a role for thinking, analysis, and academic knowledge. 
Many educational institutions offer experiential education programs such as internships, 
field projects, and classroom experiential learning exercises to add a direct experience 
component to their traditional academic studies. Here it is thought of as an educa-
tional technique like service learning, problem-based learning, action learning, or team 
xix
Introduction
 learning. Lifelong learning is often conceived as a process of learning from direct life 
experiences that is controlled by the individual.
Buchmann and Schwille (1983) argue against education based on this type of experiential 
learning and further propose that the purpose of formal education is to overcome the 
biases inherent in the process of learning from ongoing life experience. They cite numer-
ous sources of error in judgments based on experience such as Tversky and Kahneman’s 
(1973) availability heuristic where the availability of objects and events in memory such 
as those experienced firsthand tend to be overused. Similarly vivid experiences tend to 
be weighted more highly than objective data. One’s experience is necessarily influenced 
by their political and social context and thus is biased in judging social and political 
issues from other perspectives in the social order. They argue that reading is in some 
ways superior to reflection on personal experience because it broadens possibilities and 
perspectives. Secondhand knowledge is more generalizable and can go beyond what 
is known from experience. They conclude, “The measure of education is the degree 
to which it allows all people to access the objective contents of thought, to theoretical 
systems, problems and ideas with a range of implications not yet known” (1973, p. 46).
In a series of experiments examining performance after repeated decision making with 
outcome feedback called action-based or experiential learning, Eisenstein and Hutchin-
son (2006) conclude that “managers and consumers should increase their use of objec-
tive analyses and decrease reliance on experience or intuition” (2006, p. 256). Their 
studies showed that learning from experience was dependent on learning goals. “Some 
goals direct attention toward information that results in learning that transfers across 
situations, but other goals result in learning that is distorted by the characteristics of 
the stimuli that were considered most goal relevant. Contrary to popular wisdom, we 
found that reliance on this type of experiential learning is likely to be a risky proposition 
because it can be either accurate and efficient or errorful and biased” (2006, p. 257).
Brehmer (1980) cites studies showing that experienced experts are often no better 
than novices at making clinical judgments; for example, a study that compared clinical 
psychologists’ and secretaries’ ability to diagnose brain damage showed no difference 
between these two groups. He also describes studies that show that people have a num-
ber of biases that prevent them from using the information that experience provides. He 
concludes that experience does not necessarily lead to better judgment and decisions 
“because it stems from an untenable conception of the nature of experience, a concep-
tion that assumes that truth is manifest and does not have to be inferred . . . if we do not 
learn from experience, this is largely because experience often gives us little information 
to learn from” (1980, pp. 239–240).
In The Ambiguities of Experience the great organizational theorist James March con-
trasts his definition of experiential knowledge, “lessons extracted from the ordinary 
course of life and work,” with academic knowledge “generated by systematic  observation 
and  analysis by expert and transmitted by authorities” (2010, p. 9). He attributes the 
xx 
Introduction
problems and pitfalls of learning from experience to the incomprehensible nature of 
experience. “Experience is rooted in a complicated causal system that can be described 
adequately by a description that is too complex for the human mind” (2010, p. 47). “As 
a result, the lessons derived from experiential learning are rife with unjustified conclu-
sions, superstitious associations, misleading correlations, tautological generalizations, 
and systematic biases” (2010, p. 107). 
When experiential learning is defined as a naturalistic ongoing process of direct learning 
from life experiences contrasted with the systematic learning of formal science and edu-
cation, the picture that emerges is that experiential learning is haphazard, unreliable, and 
misleading, and it must be corrected by academic knowledge. The characterization of 
experiential learning conjures images of the ordinary persons blindly groping their way 
through daily experiences while academic knowledge is created by extraordinary persons 
who are presumably immune to the biases of learning from ordinary experience. For all 
humans, experience does not yield reliable knowledge easily. The experiential learning 
biases described above apply in the scientific laboratory as well as on the street. Scientists 
also learn from experience and are equally challenged by the difficulties of overcoming 
the biases involved. What the above cost/benefit analyses of experiential and academic 
knowledge fail to consider are the biases and limitations of generalized academic knowl-
edge. Judgments and decisions based on “objective” knowledge can also be incorrect and 
unreliable because of unjustified assumptions in the analysis of data, professional tunnel 
vision that reinforces an availability heuristic in judgment, and many of the other prob-
lems cited above that are associated with learning in the course of ordinary life. Further, 
the context-free nature of generalized knowledge which is often considered its strength 
can become a liability in practice through the misapplication of generalized knowledge to 
a specific context. The first chapter of Mary Parker Follett’s Creative Experience offers an 
excellent analysis of the limitations of the expert’s generalized knowledge and the process 
through it is applied: “The social process is not, first, scientific investigation, then some 
method of persuading the people to abandon their own experience and thought, and 
lastly an acclaiming populace. The social process is a process of cooperating experience. 
But for this every one of us must acquire the scientific attitude of mind. This will not 
make us professional experts; it will enable us to work with professional experts and to 
find our place in a society which needs the experience of all, to build up a society which 
shall embody the experience of all” (1924, p. 30).
Experiential learning in Elt
The above definition of experiential learning as in-context experiencing and action is 
not the meaning of experiential learning as defined in ELT. My intention in using the 
term “experiential” was to describe a theoretical perspective on the individual learning 
process that applied in all situations and arenas of life, a holistic process of learning that 
can aid in overcoming the difficulties of learning from experience enumerated above. 
xxi
Introduction
The aim of ELT is to create, through a synthesis of the works of the foundational schol-
ars, a theory that helps explain how experience is transformed into learning and reli-
able knowledge. Truth is not manifest in experience; it must be inferred by a process of 
learning that questions preconceptions of direct experience, tempers the vividness and 
emotion of experience with critical reflection, and extracts the correct lessons from the 
consequences of action.
Dewey, himself, struggled with the incomprehensibility of experience to the point that, 
in preparing a new introduction to his master philosophical work Experience and Nature 
(1988/1925), he considered changing the title. In his 1951 draft for a new introduction, 
he wrote, “Were I to write (or rewrite) Experience and Nature today I would entitle the 
book Culture and Nature and the treatment of specific subject-matters would be cor-
respondingly modified. I would abandon the term ‘experience’ because of my growing 
realization that the historical obstacles which prevented understanding of my use of 
‘experience’ are, for all practical purposes, insurmountable. I would substitute the term 
‘culture’ because with its meanings as now firmly established it can fully and freely carry 
my philosophy of experience.” In this respect, he may have been influenced by the work 
of Vygotsky who emphasized the powerful influence of cultural artifacts and tools such 
as language on experience.
Dewey came to the realization that most experience is culturally mediated by many pre-
vious trips around the learning cycle: 
Experience is already overlaid and saturated with the products of the reflection 
of past generations and by-gone ages. It is filled with interpretations, classifica-
tions, due to sophisticated thought, which have become incorporated into what 
seems to be fresh naïve empirical material. It would take more wisdom than is 
possessed by the wisest historical scholar to track all off these absorbed borrow-
ings to their original sources. [Dewey, 1925, p. 40]
He called this “empirical experience” which was conservative, tradition bound, and 
prone to conformity and dogmatism. He emphasized that this traditional flow of experi-
ence must be interrupted to initiate reflection and learning. While he argued that it was 
necessary to reflect on experience in order to draw out the meaning in it and to use that 
meaning as a guide in future experiences, he observed that the reflective process seemed 
to be initiated only when we are “stuck” with a problem or difficulty or “struck” by the 
strangeness of something outside of our usual experience (Dewey, 1933). Paulo Freire 
made a similar point arguing that an intense direct experience, such as a majestic sunrise, 
which he called “espanto” or shock, was necessary for deep learning.
In this formulation, Dewey echoes his collaborator William James, whose radical empiri-
cism was foundational for the later development of the philosophy of pragmatism. James 
proposed radical empiricism as a new philosophy of reality and mind, which resolved 
xxii 
Introduction
the conflicts between nineteenth-century rationalism and empiricism as expressed in the 
philosophies of idealism and materialism. Speaking of “tangles” created by philosophi-
cal and psychological inquiry in his time, he succinctly describes the central principles 
of both philosophies: “It seems to me that if radical empiricism be good for anything, 
it ought, with its pragmatic method and principle of pure experience, be able to avoid 
such tangles, or at least simplify them somewhat. The pragmatic method starts from 
the postulate that there is no difference of truth that doesn’t make a difference of fact 
somewhere; and it seeks to determine the meaning of all differences of opinion by mak-
ing the discussion as soon as possible hinge on some practical or particular issue. The 
principle of pure experience is also a methodological postulate. . . . Everything real must 
be experiencable somewhere, and every kind of thing experienced must be somewhere 
real” (1943, pp. 159–160).
For James, everything begins and ends in the continuous flux and flow of experience. In 
short, experience is all there is—“we start with the supposition that there is only one pri-
mal stuff or material in the world, a stuff of which everything is composed . . . we call that 
stuff ‘pure experience’” (1943, p. 4). In this formulation, the duality between the mind 
(thought) and physical world (thing) is resolved since both are experienced but with dif-
ferent characteristics. Thought is the concrete here-and-now experience “redoubled” in 
reflection—“If it be the self-same piece of pure experience taken twice over that serves 
now as thought and now as thing . . . how comes it that its attributes should differ so 
fundamentally in the two takings? As thing, the experience is extended; as thought, it 
occupies no space or place. As thing, it is red, hard, and heavy; but who ever heard of a 
red, hard, or heavy thought” (1943, pp. 27–28).
James was influenced in this view by Husserl’s phenomenological view of experience 
which Calvin Scrhag in Experience and Being says, “conveys the unity of insight and 
action, perception and conception, knowledge and valuation, theory and practice. Expe-
rience has to do with seeing into a situation and acting within it. It includes in its range 
perceptual acts and the anticipation of concepts. It involves both the knowledge and 
evaluation of objects, events, and situations. Thus experience in its primitive presence 
lies beyond any conflict between theory and practice, subject and object, intellect and 
will” (cited in Hopkins, 1993, p. 53). Dewey set forth the postulate of immediate empiri-
cism to describe radical empiricism. He argued that the significance of the principle is 
that of a philosophical method of analysis, “If you wish to find out what subjective, objec-
tive, physical, mental, cosmic, psychic, cause, substance, purpose, activity, evil, being, 
quantity—any philosophical term, in short—means go to experience and see what it is 
experienced as” (1905, p. 399).
The implication of the philosophy of radical empiricism for experiential learning theory 
and the experiential learning cycle is that it is not only the Concrete Experience mode 
of learning that is experiential, all modes of the learning cycle (see Figure 2.5, p. 51) are 
included in experience. Both modes of grasping experience—Concrete Experience (CE) 
xxiii
Introduction
and Abstract Conceptualization (AC)—and both modes of transforming experience—
Reflective Observation (RO) and Active Experimentation (AE)—are part of the experi-
ential learning process. Many use the term experiential learning to refer to exercises and 
games used to involve students in the learning process. However, a classroom lecture 
may be an abstract experience, but it is also a concrete one, when, for example, a learner 
admires and imitates the lecturer. Likewise a learner may work hard to create an abstract 
model in order to make sense of an internship experience or experiential exercise. From 
the learner’s perspective, solitary reflection can be an intensely emotional concrete expe-
rience, and the action of programming a computer can be a highly abstract experience.
Returning to my vivid sunrise experience in Bethel, Maine, for Dewey I was struck, for 
Freire it was a shock, for James it was a pure experience. It was, of course, not totally a 
pure experience, being surrounded by many thoughts. I had read about Lewin’s labo-
ratory method and Rogers, emphasis on experiencing in the change process. But the 
experience had the effect of focusing my attention and drawing me more deeply into a 
commitment to explore it more deeply. As Dewey said, I was provoked by it into criti-
cal reflection, a reflection that led to an idea (the learning cycle) which we tried out in 
action, the consequences of which provided new stuckness (e.g., student and Peace Corps 
volunteer resistance) and other trips around the learning cycle. All of these were experi-
ences—the concrete “pure experience,” the critical reflection, thinking about ideas, and 
the process of implementing actions. The critics of learning from direct experience cited 
above describe how the vividness of a personal experience can cause it to have undue 
weight in decisions and judgments. Whether it was undue or not, I certainly gave it a lot 
of weight. It captured my interest and attention and thus created a continuity of selected 
experiences that continues to this day, following James interest–attention–selection cycle. 
James in The Principles of Psychology describes how attention plays its focus “like a spot-
light” across the field of consciousness in a way that is sometimes involuntary, as when 
the shock of pure experience “captures” our attention, but is often voluntary. James 
defines the voluntary process as a spiral of interest–attention–selection that creates a 
continuous ongoing flow of experience summarized in the pithy statement: “My experi-
ence is what I agree to attend to” (1890, p. 403). He defines interest as an “intelligible 
perspective” that directs attention and ultimately selection of some experiences over oth-
ers. Selection feeds back to refine and integrate a person’s intelligible perspective serving 
as “the very keel on which our mental ship is built” (James cited in Leary, 1992, p. 157).
Experiential Learning Theory Research Today
The most gratifying and motivating result of experiential learning theory for me has been 
in the way it has stimulated and focused a scholarly research conversation about expe-
riential learning. Experience Based Learning Systems was created in 1980 to facilitate 
experiential learning theory research and communication among researchers and prac-
titioners of experiential learning through its website www.learningfromexperience.com. 
xxiv 
Introduction
Since its first statement in 1971 (Kolb, 1971; Kolb, Rubin, and McIntyre, 1971), there 
have been many studies using experiential learning theory to advance the theory and 
practice of experiential learning. Since experiential learning theory is a holistic theory of 
learning that identifies learning style differences among different academic specialties, 
it is not surprising to see that experiential learning theory research is highly interdisci-
plinary, addressing learning and educational issues in many fields. An analysis of the 
1,004 entries in the 1999 bibliography (Kolb, Boyatzis, and Mainemelis, 2001) shows 207 
studies in management, 430 in education, 104 in information science, 101 in psychology, 
72 in medicine, 63 in nursing, 22 in accounting, and 5 in law. About 55 percent of this 
research has appeared in refereed journal articles, 20 percent appeared in doctoral dis-
sertations, 10 percent appeared in books and book chapters, and 15 percent appeared in 
conference proceedings, research reports, and others.
Since 2000 experiential learning theory research in these fields around the world has 
more than quadrupled. A 2013 review of management education research (Arbaugh, 
Dearmond, and Rau) showed that 27 percent of the top cited articles in management 
education journals were about experiential learning and learning styles. Research in 
engineering, computer science, and health care has increased substantially. The current 
experiential learning theory bibliographies include nearly 4,000 entries from 1971–2014. 
Kolb and Kolb (2013) have summarized selected studies of the experiential learning 
method and the Learning Style Inventory (LSI) applied in 30 different professions and 
academic disciplines. The studies cover a broad range of applications using experiential 
learning theory and the Learning Style Inventory. Some studies have used the LSI and 
the experiential learning cycle to understand and manage differences between students 
and faculty learning styles. Some educators have used an experimental design to com-
pare the effectiveness of an experiential learning method with a more traditional course 
format, whereas others have developed and implemented instructional methods using 
the experiential learning model as a framework. 
Included are research studies from every region of the world with many contributions 
coming from the United States, Canada, Brazil, the United Kingdom, China, India, Aus-
tralia, Japan, Norway, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Thailand. These studies 
support the cross-cultural validity of experiential learning theory and the Kolb Learning 
Style Inventory (KLSI) and also support practical applicability across cultures. The KLSI 
has been translated into many languages including English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, 
Arabic, Russian, Dutch, German, Swedish, Chinese, Romanian, Persian, Thai, and Japa-
nese. The value of the holistic ELT framework for understanding cultural differences 
has been show in a number of studies on cross-cultural management (Kayes, Kayes, 
and Yamazaki, 2005; Kayes, Kayes, and Yamazaki, 2006; Yamazaki, and Kayes, 2004; 
Yamazaki and Kayes, 2007).
There have been two comprehensive reviews of the experiential learning theory lit-
erature, one qualitative and one quantitative. In 1991, Hickox extensively reviewed the 
xxv
Introduction
theoretical origins of  experiential learning theory and qualitatively analyzed 81 studies 
that focused on the application of the  experiential learning theory model as well as on 
the application of the concept of learning style in accounting and business education, 
helping professions, medical professions, post-secondary education, and teacher edu-
cation. She concluded that, overall, 61.7 percent of the studies supported  experiential 
learning theory, 16.1 percent showed mixed support, and 22.2 percent did not support 
experiential learning theory. In 1994, Iliff conducted a meta-analysis of 101 quantitative 
LSI studies culled from 275 dissertations and 624 articles that were qualitative, theoreti-
cal, and quantitative studies of ELT and the KLSI (LSI, Kolb, 1971, 1985, 1999a, 2005). 
Using Hickox’s evaluation format, he found that 49 studies showed strong support for 
the LSI, 40 showed mixed support, and 12 studies showed no support. About half of the 
101 studies reported sufficient data on the LSI scales to compute effect sizes via meta-
analysis. Most studies reported correlations that fell in the .2 to .5 range for the LSI scales. 
In conclusion, Iliff suggested that the magnitude of these statistics is not sufficient to 
meet standards of predictive validity, while noting that the LSI was not intended to be a 
predictive psychological test like IQ, GRE, or GMAT. The LSI was originally developed 
as a self-assessment exercise and a means for construct validation of experiential learn-
ing theory. 
Judged by the standards of construct validity, experiential learning theory has been 
widely accepted as a useful framework for learning-centered educational innovation, 
including instructional design, curriculum development, and life-long learning. Aca-
demic field and job classification studies viewed as a whole also show a pattern of results 
consistent with the  experiential learning theory structure of knowledge theory. Most of 
the debate and critique in the ELT/LSI literature has centered on the psychometric prop-
erties of the LSI. Results from this research have been of great value in revising the LSI 
in 1985, 1999, 2005, and most recently in 2011. The Kolb Learning Style Inventory 4.0 
(Kolb and Kolb, 2011; see Chapter 4 Update and Reflections). Recent critique (see Chap-
ter 2 Update and Reflections) has been more focused on the theory than the instrument 
examining the intellectual origins and underlying assumptions of experiential learning 
theory from what might be called a critical theory perspective where the theory is seen as 
individualistic, cognitivist, and technological (e.g., Vince, 1997; Holman, 1997; Hopkins, 
1993). Kayes (2002) has reviewed these and other critics of experiential learning theory 
and offered his own critique of the critics. He suggests that critics have overlooked the 
role of Vygotsky’s social constructivist learning theory in the experiential learning theory 
of development and the role of personal knowledge and social knowledge in experiential 
learning. He proposes an extension of experiential learning theory based on Lacan’s post-
structuralist analysis that elaborates the fracture between personal and social knowledge 
and the role that language plays in shaping experience.

The Foundations of Contemporary  
Approaches to Experiential Learning
The modern discovery of inner experience, of a realm of purely  personal 
events that are always at the individual’s command and that are his 
 exclusively as well as inexpensively for refuge, consolidation and thrill, is 
also a great and liberating discovery. It implies a new worth and sense of 
dignity in human individuality, a sense that an individual is not merely a 
property of nature, set in place according to a scheme independent of him 
. . . but that he adds something, that he makes a contribution. It is the 
counterpart of what distinguishes modern  science, experimental hypo-
thetical, a logic of discovery having  therefore  opportunity for individual 
temperament, ingenuity, invention. It is the counterpart of modern 
politics, art, religion and industry where individuality is given room and 
movement, in contrast to the ancient scheme of experience, which held 
individuals tightly within a given order subordinate to its structure and 
patterns.
—John Dewey, Experience and Nature
H
uman beings are unique among all living organisms in that their primary adap-
tive specialization lies not in some particular physical form or skill or fit in an 
ecological niche, but rather in identification with the process of adaptation 
itself—in the process of learning. We are thus the learning species, and our survival 
depends on our ability to adapt not only in the reactive sense of fitting into the physical 
and social worlds, but in the proactive sense of creating and shaping those worlds.
Our species long ago left the harmony of a nonreflective union with the “natural” order to 
embark on an adaptive journey of its own choosing. With this choosing has come respon-
sibility for a world that is increasingly of our own creation—a world paved in concrete, 
girded in steel, wrapped in plastic, and positively awash in symbolic  communications.

Experiential Learning
From those first few shards of clay recording inventories of ancient commerce has sprung 
a symbol store that is exploding at exponential rates, and that has been growing thus for 
hundreds of years. On paper, through wires and glass, on cables into our homes—even in 
the invisible air around us, our world is filled with songs and stories, news and commerce 
interlaced on precisely encoded radio waves and microwaves.
The risks and rewards of mankind’s fateful choice have become increasingly apparent 
to us all as our transforming and creative capacities shower us with the bounty of tech-
nology and haunt us with the nightmare of a world that ends with the final countdown,  
“. . . three, two, one, zero.” This is civilization on the high wire, where one misstep can 
send us cascading into oblivion. We cannot go back, for the processes we have initiated 
now have their own momentum. Machines have begun talking to machines, and we grow 
accustomed to obeying their conclusions. We cannot step off—“drop out”—for the safety 
net of the natural order has been torn and weakened by our aggressive creativity. We can 
only go forward on this path—nature’s “human” experiment in survival.
We have cast our lot with learning, and learning will pull us through. But this learning 
process must be reimbued with the texture and feeling of human experiences shared and 
interpreted through dialogue with one another. In the over-eager embrace of the ratio-
nal, scientific, and technological, our concept of the learning process itself was distorted 
first by rationalism and later by behaviorism. We lost touch with our own experience as 
the source of personal learning and development and, in the process, lost that experien-
tial centeredness necessary to counterbalance the loss of “scientific” centeredness that 
has been progressively slipping away since Copernicus.
That learning is an increasing preoccupation for everyone is not surprising. The emerg-
ing “global village,” where events in places we have barely heard of quickly disrupt our 
daily lives, the dizzying rate of change, and the exponential growth of knowledge all 
generate nearly overwhelming needs to learn just to survive. Indeed, it might well be 
said that learning is an increasing occupation for us all; for in every aspect of our life and 
work, to stay abreast of events and to keep our skills up to the “state of the art” requires 
more and more of our time and energy. For individuals and organizations alike, learning 
to adapt to new “rules of the game” is becoming as critical as performing well under the 
old rules. In moving toward what some are optimistically heralding as “the future learn-
ing society,” some monumental problems and challenges are before us. According to 
some observers, we are on the brink of a revolution in the educational system—sparked 
by wrenching economic and demographic forces and fueled by rapid social and techno-
logical changes that render a “frontloaded” educational strategy obsolete. New challenges 
for social justice and equal opportunity are arising, based on Supreme Court decisions 
affirming the individual’s right of access to education and work based on proven ability 
to perform; these decisions challenge the validity of traditional diplomas and tests as 
measures of that ability. Organizations need new ways to renew and revitalize themselves 
and to forestall obsolescence for the organization and the people in it. But perhaps most 
3
Chapter 1 The Foundations of Contemporary Approaches to Experiential Learning 
of all, the future learning society represents a personal challenge for millions of adults 
who find learning is no longer “for kids” but a central lifelong task essential for personal 
development and career success.
Some specifics help to underscore dimensions of this personal challenge:
 
■ Between 80 and 90 percent of the adult population will carry out at least one 
learning project this year, and the typical adult will spend 500 hours during the 
year learning new things (Tough, 1977).
 
■ Department of Labor statistics estimate that the average American will change 
jobs seven times and careers three times during his or her lifetime. A 1978 study 
estimated that 40 million Americans are in a state of job or career transition, and 
over half these people plan additional education (Arbeiter et al., 1978).
 
■ A study by the American College Testing Program (1982) shows that credit 
given in colleges and universities for prior learning experience has grown 
steadily from 1973–74 to 1980–82. In 1980–82, 1¼ million quarter credit hours 
were awarded for prior learning experience. That learning is a lifelong process is 
increasingly being recognized by the traditional credit/degree structure of higher 
education.
People do learn from their experience, and the results of that learning can be reliably 
assessed and certified for college credit. At the same time, programs of sponsored expe-
riential learning are on the increase in higher education. Internships, field placements, 
work/study assignments, structured exercises and role plays, gaming simulations, and 
other forms of experience-based education are playing a larger role in the curricula 
of undergraduate and professional programs. For many so-called nontraditional stu-
dents—minorities, the poor, and mature adults—experiential learning has become the 
method of choice for learning and personal development. Experience-based education 
has become widely accepted as a method of instruction in colleges and universities 
across the nation.
Yet in spite of its increasingly widespread use and acceptance, experiential learning 
has its critics and skeptics. Some see it as gimmicky and faddish, more concerned with 
technique and process than content and substance. It often appears too thoroughly prag-
matic for the academic mind, dangerously associated with the disturbing anti-intellectual 
and vocationalist trends in American society. This book is in one sense addressed to the 
concerns of these critics and skeptics, for without guiding theory and principles, expe-
riential learning can well become another educational fad—just new techniques for the 
educator’s bag of tricks. Experiential learning theory offers something more substan-
tial and enduring. It offers the foundation for an approach to education and learning 
as a lifelong process that is soundly based in intellectual traditions of social psychol-
ogy, philosophy, and cognitive psychology. The experiential learning model pursues 
a framework for examining and strengthening the critical linkages among education, 
4 
Experiential Learning
work, and  personal development. See Figure 1.1. It offers a system of competencies for 
describing job demands and corresponding educational objectives, and it emphasizes 
the critical linkages that can be developed between the classroom and the “real world” 
with experiential learning methods. It pictures the workplace as a learning environment 
that can enhance and supplement formal education and can foster personal development 
through meaningful work and career-development opportunities. And it stresses the role 
of formal education in lifelong learning and the development of individuals to their full 
potential as citizens, family members, and human beings.
In this chapter, we will examine the major traditions of experiential learning, exploring 
the dimensions of current practice and their intellectual origins. By understanding and 
articulating the themes of these traditions, we will be far more capable of shaping and 
guiding the development of the exciting new educational programs based on experiential 
learning. As Kurt Lewin, one of the founders of experiential learning, said in his most 
famous remark, “There is nothing so practical as a good theory.”
Experiential Learning in Higher Education:  
The Legacy of John Dewey
In the field of higher education, there is a growing group of educators—faculty, admin-
istrators, and interested outsiders—who see experiential education as a way to revitalize 
the university curriculum and to cope with many of the changes facing higher education 
today. Although this movement is attributed to the educational philosophy of John Dewey,

its source is in reality a diverse group spanning several generations. At a  conference of the 
National Society for Internships and Experiential Education (NSIEE), a speaker remarked 
that there were three identifiable generations in the room: the older generation of Dew-
eyite progressive educators, the now middle-aged children of the 1960s’ Peace Corps and 
civil-rights movement, and Vietnam political activists of the 1970s. Yet it is the work of 
Dewey, without doubt the most influential educational theorist of the twentieth century, 
that best articulates the guiding principles for programs of experiential learning in higher 
education. In 1938, Dewey wrote Experience and Education in an attempt to bring some 
understanding to the growing conflict between “traditional” education and his “progres-
sive” approach. In it, he outlined the directions for change implied in his approach:
If one attempts to formulate the philosophy of education implicit in the practices 
of the new education, we may, I think, discover certain common principles. . . 
To imposition from above is opposed expression and cultivation of individuality; 
to external discipline is opposed free activity; to learning from texts and teach-
ers, learning through experience; to acquisition of isolated skills and techniques 
by drill is opposed acquisition of them as means of attaining ends which make 
direct vital appeal; to preparation for a more or less remote future is opposed 
making the most of the opportunities of present life; to static aims and materials 
is opposed acquaintance with a changing world. . . .
I take it that the fundamental unity of the newer philosophy is found in the idea 
that there is an intimate and necessary relation between the processes of actual 
experience and education. [Dewey, 1938, pp. 19, 20]
In the last 40 years, many of Dewey’s ideas have found their way into “traditional” edu-
cational programs, but the challenges his approaches were developed to meet, those of 
coping with change and lifelong learning, have increased even more dramatically. It is to 
meeting these challenges that experiential educators in higher education have addressed 
themselves—not in the polarized spirit of what Arthur Chickering (1977) calls “either/
orneriness,” but in a spirit of cooperative innovation that integrates the best of the tra-
ditional and the experiential. The tools for this work involve many traditional methods 
that are as old as, or in some cases older than, the formal education system itself. These 
methods include apprenticeships, internships, work/study programs, cooperative educa-
tion, studio arts, laboratory studies, and field projects. In all these methods, learning is 
experiential, in the sense that:
. . . the learner is directly in touch with the realities being studied. . . . It involves 
direct encounter with the phenomenon being studied rather than merely think-
ing about the encounter or only considering the possibility of doing something 
with it. [Keeton and Tate, 1978, p. 2]
In higher education today, these “traditional” experiential learning methods are receiv-
ing renewed interest and attention, owing in large measure to the changing educational 
6 
Experiential Learning
environment in this country. As universities have moved through open-enrollment pro-
grams and so on, to expand educational opportunities for the poor and minorities, there 
has been a corresponding need for educational methods that can translate the abstract 
ideas of academia into the concrete practical realities of these people’s lives. Many of 
these new students have not been rigorously socialized into the classroom/textbook way 
of learning but have developed their own distinctive approach to learning, sometimes 
characterized as “survival skills” or “street wisdom.” For these, the field placement or 
work/study program is an empowering experience that allows them to capitalize on their 
practical strengths while testing the application of ideas discussed in the classroom.
Similarly, as the population in general grows older and the frequency of adult career 
change continues to increase, the “action” in higher education will be centered around 
adult learners who demand that the relevance and application of ideas be demon-
strated and tested against their own accumulated experience and wisdom. Many now 
approach education and midlife with a sense of fear (“I’ve forgotten how to study”) 
and resentment based on unpleasant memories of their childhood schooling. As Rita 
Weathersby has pointed out, “adults’ learning interests are embedded in their personal 
histories, in their visions of who they are in the world and in what they can do and 
want to do” (1978, p. 19). For these adults, learning methods that combine work and 
study, theory and practice provide a more familiar and therefore more productive 
arena for learning.
Finally, there is a marked trend toward vocationalism in higher education, spurred on 
by a group of often angry and hostile critics—students who feel cheated because the 
career expectations created in college have not been met, and employers who feel that the 
graduates they recruit into their organizations are woefully unprepared. Something has 
clearly gone awry in the supposed link between education and work, resulting in strong 
demands that higher education “shape up” and make itself relevant. There are in my 
view dangerous currents of anti-intellectualism in this movement, based on reactionary 
and counterproductive views of learning and development; but a real problem has been 
identified here. Experiential learning offers some avenues for solving it constructively.
For another group of educators, experiential learning is not a set of educational methods; 
it is a statement of fact: People do learn from their experiences. The emphasis of this 
group is on assessment of prior experience-based learning in order to grant academic 
credit for degree programs or certification for licensing in trades and professions. The 
granting of credit for prior experience is viewed by some as a movement of great promise:
The great significance of systematic recognition of prior learning is the linkage 
it provides between formal education and adult life; that is, a mechanism for 
integrating education and work, for recognizing the validity of all learning that 
is relevant to a college degree and for actively fostering recurrent education. 
[Willingham et al., 1977, p. 60]

Chapter 1 The Foundations of Contemporary Approaches to Experiential Learning 
Yet it has also raised great concern, primarily about the maintenance of quality, since 
such assessment procedures might easily be abused by “degree mills” or mail-order 
diploma operations. To respond to both these opportunities and these concerns, in 1973 
the Cooperative Assessment of Experiential Learning (CAEL) project was established in 
cooperation with the Educational Testing Service to create and implement practical and 
valid methodologies for assessing what people have learned from their prior work and 
life experience.1
As might be expected, researchers and practitioners in this area are more concerned with 
what people learn—the identifiable knowledge and skill outcomes of learning from accu-
mulated experience—than they are with how learning takes place, the process of experi-
ential learning. This emphasis on the outcomes of learning and their reliable assessment is 
critical to the establishment of effective links between education and work, since this linkage 
depends on the accurate identification and matching of personal skills with job demands. 
Since the Supreme Court’s Griggs v. Duke Power decision, establishing an equitable and 
valid matching process has become a top priority in our nation’s efforts toward equal 
employment opportunity. In that case, Griggs, an applicant for a janitorial job, sued to chal-
lenge a requirement that applicants have a high school diploma. In supporting Griggs, the 
court ruled that no test, certificate, or other procedure can be used to limit access to a job 
unless it is shown to be a valid predictor of performance on that job. This ruling, which has 
since been extended and supported by other high-court rulings, has set forth a great chal-
lenge to educators, behavioral scientists, and employers—to develop competence-based 
methods of instruction and assessment that are meaningfully related to the world of work.
Taken together, the renewed emphasis on “traditional” experiential learning methods 
and the emphasis on competence-based methods of education, assessment, and certifica-
tion signal significant changes in the structure of higher education. Arthur Chickering 
sees it this way:
. . . there is no question that issues raised by experiential learning go to the heart 
of the academic enterprise. Experiential learning leads us to question the assump-
tions and conventions underlying many of our practices. It turns us away from 
credit hours and calendar time toward competence, working knowledge, and 
information pertinent to jobs, family relationships, community responsibilities, 
and broad social concerns. It reminds us that higher education can do more than 
develop verbal skills and deposit information in those storage banks between the 
ears. It can contribute to more complex kinds of  intellectual  development and to 
more pervasive dimensions of human development required for effective citizen-
ship. It can help students cope with shifting developmental tasks imposed by the 
life cycle and rapid social change.
1.  CAEL has since changed its name to the Council for the Advancement of Experiential Learning to 
reflect its broader interests in experiential learning methods as well as assessment.

Experiential Learning
If these potentials are to be realized, major changes in the current structures, 
processes, and content of higher education will be required. The campus will no 
longer be the sole location for learning, the professor no longer the sole source 
of wisdom. Instead, campus facilities and professional expertise will be resources 
linked to a wide range of educational settings, to practitioners, field supervisors, 
and adjunct faculty. This linking together will be achieved through systematic 
relationships with cultural organizations, businesses, social agencies, museums, 
and political and governmental operations. We no longer will bind ourselves 
completely to the procrustean beds of fixed time units set by semester, trimester, 
or quarter systems, which stretch some learning to the point of transparency and 
lop off other learning at the head or foot. Instead, such systems will be supple-
mented by flexible scheduling options that tailor time to the requirements for 
learning and to the working realities of various experiential opportunities. Edu-
cational standards and credentials will increasingly rest on demonstrated levels 
of knowledge and competence as well as on actual gains made by students and 
the value added by college programs. We will recognize the key significance of 
differences among students, not only in verbal skills and academic preparation 
but also in learning styles, capacity for independent work, self-understanding, 
social awareness and human values. Batch processing of large groups will be 
supplemented by personalized instruction and contract learning.
The academy and the professoriat will continue to carry major responsibility for 
research activities, for generating new knowledge, and for supplying the perspec-
tives necessary to cope with the major social problems rushing toward us. That 
work will be enriched and strengthened by more broad-based faculty and stu-
dent participation and by its wide-ranging links to ongoing experiential settings. 
[Chickering, 1977, pp. 86–87]
Experiential Learning in Training and Organization  
Development: The Contributions of Kurt Lewin
Another tradition of experiential learning, larger in numbers of participants and per-
haps wider in its scope of influence, stems from the research on group dynamics by the 
founder of American social psychology, Kurt Lewin. Lewin’s work has had a profound 
influence on the discipline of social psychology and on its practical counterpart, the field 
of organizational behavior. His innovative research methods and theories, coupled with 
the personal charisma of his intellectual leadership, have been felt through three genera-
tions of scholars and practitioners in both fields. Although the scope of his work has 
been vast, ranging from leadership and management style to mathematical contributions 
to social-science field theory, it is his work on group dynamics and the methodology of 
action research that have had the most far-reaching practical significance. From these 
9
Chapter 1 The Foundations of Contemporary Approaches to Experiential Learning 
studies came the laboratory-training method and T-groups (T = training), one of the 
most potent educational innovations in this century. The action-research method has 
proved a useful approach to planned-change interventions in small groups and large 
complex organizations and community systems. Today this methodology forms the cor-
nerstone of most organization development efforts. The consistent theme in all Lewin’s 
work was his concern for the integration of theory and practice, stimulated if not created 
by his experience as a refugee to the United States from Nazi Germany. His classic stud-
ies on authoritarian, democratic, and laissez faire leadership styles were his attempt to 
understand in a practical way the psychological dynamics of dictatorship and democracy. 
His best-known quotation, “There is nothing so practical as a good theory,” symbolizes 
his commitment to the integration of scientific inquiry and social problem solving. His 
approach is illustrated no better than in the actual historical event that spawned the 
“discovery” of the T-group (see Marrow, 1969). In the summer of 1946, Lewin and his 
colleagues, most notably Ronnald Lippitt, Leland Bradford, and Kenneth Benne, set out 
to design a new approach to leadership and group-dynamics training for the Connecticut 
State Interracial Commission. The two-week training program began with an experimen-
tal emphasis encouraging group discussion and decision making in an atmosphere where 
staff and participants treated one another as peers. In addition, the research and train-
ing staff collected extensive observations and recordings of the groups’ activities. When 
the participants went home at night, the research staff gathered together to report and 
analyze the data collected during the day. Most of the staff felt that trainees should not 
be involved in these analytical sessions where their experiences and behavior were being 
discussed, for fear that the discussions might be harmful to them. Lewin was receptive, 
however, when a small group of participants asked to join in these discussions. One of the 
men who was there, Ronald Lippitt, describes what happened in the discussion meeting 
that three trainees attended:
Sometime during the evening, an observer made some remarks about the behav-
ior of one of the three persons who were sitting in—a woman trainee. She broke 
in to disagree with the observation and described it from her point of view. For 
a while there was quite an active dialogue between the research observer, the 
trainer, and the trainee about the interpretation of the event, with Kurt an active 
prober, obviously enjoying this different source of data that had to be coped with 
and integrated.
At the end of the evening the trainees asked if they could come back for the next 
meeting at which their behavior would be evaluated. Kurt, feeling that it had 
been a valuable contribution rather than an intrusion, enthusiastically agreed to 
their return. The next night at least half of the 50 or 60 participants were there as 
a result of the grapevine reporting of the activity by the three delegates.
The evening session from then on became the significant learning experience 
of the day, with the focus on actual behavioral events and with active dialogue 
10 
Experiential Learning
about differences of interpretation and observation of the events by those who 
had participated in them. [Lippitt, 1949]
Thus the discovery was made that learning is best facilitated in an environment where 
there is dialectic tension and conflict between immediate, concrete experience and ana-
lytic detachment. By bringing together the immediate experiences of the trainees and 
the conceptual models of the staff in an open atmosphere where inputs from each per-
spective could challenge and stimulate the other, a learning environment occurred with 
remarkable vitality and creativity.
Although Lewin was to die in 1947, the power of the educational process he had discovered 
was not lost on the other staff who were there. In the summer of 1947, they continued devel-
opment of the insights they had gained in a three-week program for change agents, this 
time in Bethel, Maine. It was here that the basic outlines of T-group theory and the labora-
tory method began to take shape. It is important to note that even in these early beginnings, 
the struggle between the “here-and-now” experiential orientation and the “there-and-then” 
theoretical orientation that has continued to plague the movement was in evidence:
There resulted a competition between discussing here-and-now happenings, 
which of necessity focused on the personal, interpersonal and group levels; and 
discussing outside case materials. This sometimes resulted in the rejection of any 
serious consideration of the observer’s report of behavioral data. More often it 
led eventually to rejection of outside problems as less involving and fascinating. 
[Benne, 1964, p. 86]
Later, in the early years of the National Training Laboratories,2 this conflict expressed 
itself in intense debates among staff as to how conceptual material should be integrated 
into the “basic encounter” process of the T-group. And still later, in the 1960s, on the 
waves of youth culture, acid rock, and Eastern mysticism, the movement was to be vir-
tually split apart into “West Coast” existential factions and “East Coast” traditionalists 
(Argyris, 1970). As we shall see later in our inquiry, this conflict between experience and 
theory is not unique to the laboratory-training process but is, in fact, a central dynamic 
in the process of experiential learning itself.
In its continuing struggle, debate, and innovation around this and other issues, the 
 laboratory-training movement has had a profound influence on the practice of adult 
education, training, and organization development. In particular, it was the spawning 
ground for two streams of development that are of central importance to experiential 
learning, one of values and one of technology. T-groups and the so-called laboratory 
method on which they were based gave central focus to the value of subjective per-
sonal experience in learning, an emphasis that at the time stood in sharp contrast to 
2. Now known as the NTL Institute for Applied Behavioral Sciences.
11
Chapter 1 The Foundations of Contemporary Approaches to Experiential Learning 
the “empty-organism” behaviorist theories of learning and classical physical-science 
definitions of knowledge acquisition as an impersonal, totally logical process based on 
detached, objective observation. This emphasis on subjective experience has developed 
into a strong commitment in the practice of experiential learning to existential values of 
personal involvement, and responsibility and humanistic values emphasizing that feel-
ings as well as thoughts are facts.
To the leaders of the movement, these values, coupled with the basic values of a human-
istic scientific process—a spirit of inquiry, expanded consciousness and choice, and 
authenticity in relationships—offered new hope-filled ideals for the conduct of human 
relationships and the management of organizations (Schein and Bennis, 1965). More 
than any other single source, it was this set of core values that stimulated the modern 
participative-management philosophies (variously called Theory Y management, 9.9 
management, System 4 management, Theory Z, and so on) so widely practiced in this 
country and increasingly around the world. In addition, these values have formed the 
guiding principles for the field of organization development and the practice of planned 
change in organizations, groups, and communities. The most recent and comprehensive 
statement of the relationship between laboratory-training values and experiential learn-
ing is the work of Argyris and Schon (1974, 1978). They maintain that learning from 
experience is essential for individual and organizational effectiveness and that this learn-
ing can occur only in situations where personal values and organizational norms support 
action based on valid information, free and informed choice, and internal commitment.
Equally important, there has emerged from the early work in sensitivity training a rapidly 
expanding applied technology for experiential learning. Beginning with small tasks (such 
as a decision-making problem) that were used in T-groups to focus the group’s experi-
ence on a particular issue (for example, processes of group decision making), there has 
developed an immense variety of tasks, structured exercises, simulations, cases, games, 
observation tools, role plays, skill-practice routines, and so on. The common core of 
these technologies is a simulated situation designed to create personal experiences for 
learners that serve to initiate their own process of inquiry and understanding. These 
technologies have had a profound effect on education, particularly for adult learners. 
The training and development field has experienced a virtual revolution in its method-
ology, moving from a “dog and pony show” approach that was only a fancy imitation of 
the traditional lecture method to a complex educational technology that relies heavily 
on experience-based simulations and self-directed learning designs (Knowles, 1970). 
Indeed, there are many who share the view of Harold Hodskinson, a former director 
of the National Institute for Education and the current president of the NTL Institute, 
that these private-sector innovations in educational technology are challenging the abil-
ity of the formal educational establishment to compete in an open market. Along with 
the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD), specialized associations 
of academics and training and development practitioners have been formed to extend 
experiential approaches that were initially focused on the human-relationship issues 
12 
Experiential Learning
emphasized in T-groups to other content areas, such as finance, marketing, and planning 
through the use of computer-aided instruction, video recording, structured role-play 
cases, and other software and hardware techniques. In addition, there are countless small 
and relatively large organizations specializing in the various educational technologies 
that have grown to support the $50 billion training and development industry in the 
United States. Although the laboratory-training movement has not been responsible for 
all these developments, it has had an undeniable influence on many of them.
Jean Piaget and the Cognitive-Development  
Tradition of Experiential Learning
The Dewey and Lewin traditions of experiential learning represent external challenges to 
the idealist or, as James (1907) terms them, rationalist philosophies that have dominated 
thinking about learning and education since the Middle Ages; Dewey from the philo-
sophical perspective of pragmatism, and Lewin from the phenomenological perspective 
of Gestalt psychology. The third tradition of experiential learning represents more of a 
challenge from within the rationalist perspective, stemming as it does from the work 
of the French developmental psychologist and genetic epistemologist Jean Piaget. His 
work on child development must stand on a par with that of Freud; but whereas Freud 
placed his emphasis on the socioemotional processes of development, Piaget’s focus is 
on cognitive-development processes—on the nature of intelligence and how it devel-
ops. Throughout his work, Piaget is as much an epistemological philosopher as he is a 
psychologist. In fact, he sees in his studies of the development of cognitive processes in 
childhood the key to understanding the nature of human knowledge itself.
It was in Piaget’s first psychological studies that he came across the insight that was to 
make him world-famous. He began to work as a student of Alfred Binet, the creator of 
the first intelligence test, standardizing test items for use in IQ and aptitude tests. Dur-
ing this work, Piaget’s interests began to diverge sharply from the traditional testing 
approach. He found himself much less interested in whether the answers that children 
gave to test problems were correct or not than he was in the process of reasoning that 
children used to arrive at the answers. He began to discover age-related regularities in 
these reasoning processes. Children at certain ages not only gave wrong answers but 
also showed qualitatively different ways of arriving at them. Younger children were not 
“dumber” than older children; they merely thought about things in an entirely different 
way. In the 50 years that followed this discovery, these ideas were to be developed and 
explored in thousands of studies by Piaget and his co-workers.
Stated most simply, Piaget’s theory describes how intelligence is shaped by experience. 
Intelligence is not an innate internal characteristic of the individual but arises as a prod-
uct of the interaction between the person and his or her environment. And for Piaget, 
action is the key. He has shown, in careful descriptive studies of children from infants 
13
Chapter 1 The Foundations of Contemporary Approaches to Experiential Learning 
to teenagers, that abstract reasoning and the power to manipulate symbols arise from 
the infant’s actions in exploring and coping with the immediate concrete environment. 
The growing child’s system of knowing changes qualitatively in successively identifi-
able stages, moving from an enactive stage, where knowledge is represented in con-
crete actions and is not separable from the experiences that spawn it, to an ikonic stage, 
where knowledge is represented in images that have an increasingly autonomous status 
from the experiences they represent, to stages of concrete and formal operations, where 
knowledge is represented in symbolic terms, symbols capable of being manipulated 
internally with complete independence from experiential reality.
In spite of its scope and the initial flurry of interest in his work in the late 1920s, Piaget’s 
research did not receive wide recognition in this country until the 1960s. Stemming as it 
did from the French rationalist tradition, Piaget’s work was not readily acceptable to the 
empirical tradition of American psychology, particularly since his clinical methods did 
not seem to meet the rigorous experimental standards that characterized the behaviorist 
research programs that dominated American psychology from 1920 to 1960. In addition, 
Piaget’s interests were more descriptive than practical. He viewed with some disdain the 
pragmatic orientation of American researchers and educators who sought to speed up 
or facilitate the development of the cognitive stages he had identified, referring to these 
interests in planned change and development as the “American question.”
Piaget’s ultimate recognition in America was due in no small part to the parallel work 
of the most prominent American cognitive psychologist, Jerome Bruner. Bruner saw in 
the growing knowledge of cognitive developmental processes the scientific foundations 
for a theory of instruction. Knowledge of cognitive developmental stages would make it 
possible to design curricula in any field in such a way that subject matter could be taught 
respectably to learners at any age or stage of cognitive development. This idea became 
at once a guiding objective and a great challenge to educators. A new movement in cur-
riculum development and teaching emerged around this idea, a movement focused on 
the design of experience-based educational programs using the principles of cognitive-
development theory. Most of these curriculum-development efforts were addressed to 
the subject matters of science and mathematics for elementary and secondary students, 
although related efforts have been made in other subject areas, such as social studies, 
and such experience-based curricula can be found in some freshman and sophomore 
college-level courses. The major task addressed by these programs was the translation of 
the abstract symbolic principles of science and mathematics into modes of representa-
tion that could be grasped by people at more concrete stages of cognitive development. 
Typically, this representation takes the form of concrete objects that can be manipulated 
and experimented with by the learner to discover the scientific principle involved. Many 
of these were modifications of Piaget’s original experiments—for example, allowing chil-
dren to pour water back and forth from tall, thin beakers to short, fat ones to discover 
the principle of conservation.
14 
Experiential Learning
When introduced in the proper climate, these experience-based curricula had the same 
exhilarating effect on the learning process as Lewin’s discovery of the T-group.  Children 
were freed from the lockstep pace of memorizing (or ignoring) watered-down presenta-
tions of scientific and mathematical principles that in some cases actually made learn-
ing more advanced principles more difficult; for example, to spend years learning to 
count only in base 10 makes learning base 2, 3, and so on, much more difficult. Learn-
ing became individualized, concrete, and self-directed. Moreover, the child was learn-
ing about the process of discovering knowledge, not just the content. Children became 
“little scientists,” exploring, experimenting, and drawing their own conclusions. These 
classrooms buzzed with the excitement and energy of intrinsically motivated learning 
activity. These experience-based learning programs changed the educational process in 
two ways. First, they altered the content of curriculum, providing new ways of teaching 
subjects that were formerly thought to be too advanced and sophisticated for youngsters; 
and second, they altered the learning process, the way that students went about learning 
these subjects.
Even though in many quarters these innovations met an enthusiastic reception and even-
tual successful implementation, they also provoked strong reaction and criticism. Some 
of these criticisms were justified. This new way of learning required a new approach to 
teaching. In some cases, teachers managed the learning process well, and intrinsically 
motivated learning was the result. In others, the climate for learning was somehow dif-
ferent; students did not learn the principle of conservation by experimenting with the 
water jars, they just learned how to pour water back and forth. Other criticisms seem to 
me less valid. Some have blamed the decline on SAT scores on the new math and other 
self-directed curricula that made learning appear to be fun and lacking in disciplined 
practice of the basics. In spirit, these debates are strongly reminiscent of the controversy 
surrounding Dewey’s progressive-education movement and the experience/theory con-
flicts concerning T-groups.
The cognitive-development tradition has had a less direct but equally powerful effect 
on adult learning. Although Piaget’s stages of cognitive development terminated in 
adolescence, the idea that there are identifiable regularities in the development process 
has been extended into later adulthood by a number of researchers. In method and 
 conceptual structure, these approaches owe a great deal to the Piagetian scheme. One 
of the first such approaches was Lawrence Kohlberg’s extension of Piaget’s early work 
on moral development (see Kurtines and Greif, 1974). Kohlberg began his research on 
schoolchildren but soon found that only the early stages of moral judgment that he had 
identified were actually achieved in childhood and that for many adults, the challenges of 
the later stages of moral judgment still lay before them. William Perry, in his outstanding 
book, Forms of Intellectual and Ethical Development in the College Years (1970), found 
similar patterns in the way Harvard students’ systems of knowledge evolved through the 
college years, moving from absolutist, authority-centered, right/wrong views of knowl-
15
Chapter 1 The Foundations of Contemporary Approaches to Experiential Learning 
edge in early college years, through stages of extreme relativism and, in their later college 
years, toward higher stages of personal commitment within relativism. Perry also found 
that these higher stages of development were not achieved by all students during college 
but, for many, posed developmental challenges that extended into their later lives. Jane 
Loevinger (1976) has attempted to integrate these and other cognitive developmental 
theories (for instance, Harvey, Hunt, and Schroder, 1961) with the socioemotional devel-
opmental theories of Erikson and others (described below) under the general rubric of 
ego development. Her six stages of ego development—impulsive, self-protective, con-
formist, conscientious, autonomous, and finally, integrated—clearly identify learning 
and development as a lifelong process.
The effects of these new conceptions of adult development are only now beginning to 
be felt. With the recognition that learning and development are lifelong processes, there 
comes a corresponding responsibility for social institutions and organizations to con-
duct their affairs in such a way that adults have experiences that facilitate their personal 
learning and development. One application of Kohlberg’s work in moral development, 
for example, has been in prison reform (Hickey and Scharf, 1980), attempting in the 
management of prisons to build a climate that fosters development toward higher moral 
stages through the creation of a “just community” within the prison society. Although 
perhaps not as dramatic and obvious, there is a corresponding need in many public and 
private organizations to improve the climate for learning and development. It is not 
just in prisons that people feel they must adopt self-protective and conformist postures 
in order to survive, seeing little reward for conscientious, autonomous, and integrated 
behavior.
Other Contributions to Experiential Learning Theory
Dewey, Lewin, and Piaget must stand as the foremost intellectual ancestors of experiential 
learning theory; however, there are other, related streams of thought that will contribute 
substantially to this inquiry. First among these are the therapeutic psychologies, stem-
ming chiefly from psychoanalysis and reflected most particularly in the work of Carl 
Jung, although also including Erik Erikson, the humanistic traditions of Carl Rogers’s 
client-centered therapy, Fritz Perls’s gestalt therapy, and the self-actualization psychology 
of Abraham Maslow.
This school of thought brings two important dimensions to experiential learning. First 
is the concept of adaptation, which gives a central role to affective experience. The 
notion that healthy adaptation requires the effective integration of cognitive and affec-
tive processes is of course central to the practice of nearly all forms of psychotherapy. 
The second contribution of the therapeutic psychologies is the conception of socio-
emotional development throughout the life cycle. The developmental schemes of Erik 
Erikson, Carl Rogers, and Abraham Maslow give a consistent and articulated picture of 
16 
Experiential Learning
the  challenges of adult development, a picture that fits well with the cognitive schemes 
just discussed. Taken together, these socioemotional and cognitive-development mod-
els provide a holistic framework for describing the adult development process and the 
learning challenges it poses. It is Jung’s theory, however, with its concept of psychologi-
cal types representing different modes of adapting to the world, and his developmen-
tal theory of individuation that will be most useful for understanding learning from 
experience.
A second line of contribution to experiential learning theory comes from what might 
be called the radical educators—in particular, the work of Brazilian educator and revo-
lutionary Paulo Freire (1973, 1974), and of Ivan Illich (1972), whose critique of West-
ern education and plan to “deschool” society concretely applies many of Freire’s ideas 
to contemporary American social problems. The core of these men’s arguments is 
that the educational system is primarily an agency of social control, a control that is 
ultimately oppressive and conservative of the capitalist system of class discrimination. 
The means for changing this system is by instilling in the population what Freire calls 
“critical consciousness,” the active exploration of the personal, experiential meaning of 
abstract concepts through dialogue among equals. If views of education and learning 
are to be cast on a political spectrum, then this viewpoint must be seen as the revolu-
tionary extension of the liberal, humanistic perspective characteristic of the Deweyite 
progressive educators and laboratory-training practitioners. As such, these views serve 
to highlight the central role of the dialectic between abstract concepts and subjective 
personal experience in educational/political conflicts between the right, which places 
priority on maintenance of the social order, and the left, which values more highly 
individual freedom and expression.
Two further perspectives will be central to an inquiry helping to unravel the rela-
tionships between learning and knowledge. The first is the very active area of brain 
research, which is attempting to identify relationships between brain functioning and 
consciousness. Most relevant for our purpose is that line of research that seeks to 
identify and describe differences in cognitive functioning associated with the left and 
right hemispheres of the brain (Levy, 1980). The relevance of this work for experiential 
learning theory lies in the fact that the modes of knowing associated with the left and 
right hemispheres correspond directly with the distinction between concrete experien-
tial and abstract cognitive approaches to learning. Thus, in his review of this literature, 
Corballis concludes:
Such evidence may be taken as support for the idea that the left hemisphere is the 
more specialized for abstract or symbolic representation, in which the symbols 
need bear no physical resemblance to the objects they represent, while the right 
hemisphere maintains representations that are isomorphic with reality itself. . . . 
[Corballis, 1980, p. 288]

Chapter 1 The Foundations of Contemporary Approaches to Experiential Learning 
The implication here is that these two modes of knowing or grasping the world stand 
as equal and complementary processes. This position stands in sharp contrast to that of 
Piaget and other cognitive theorists, who consider concrete, experience-oriented forms 
of knowing as lower developmental manifestations of true knowledge, represented by 
abstract propositional reasoning.
A full exploration of this issue requires examination of the philosophical literature, par-
ticularly the domains of metaphysics and epistemology. Here also, the scientific rational 
traditions have been dominant, even though challenged since the early years of this 
century by the pragmatism of Dewey, James, and others, and certain scientists and math-
ematicians like Michael Polanyi and Albert Einstein, who in their own work came upon 
the limitations of rational scientific inquiry. Of special relevance is the work of the phi-
losopher and metaphysician Stephen Pepper (1966, 1942), who developed a system of 
world hypotheses on which he bases a typology of knowledge systems. With this frame-
work as a guide, we shall be able to explore the relationships between the learning process 
and the knowledge systems that flow from it.
Figure 1.2 summarizes seven themes that offer guidance and direction for programs of 
experiential learning. These themes stem from the work of Dewey, Lewin, and Piaget. 
From Kurt Lewin and his followers comes the theory and technology of T-groups and 
action research. The articulation of the democratic values guiding experiential learning 
is to be found in both Lewin’s work and the educational philosophy of John Dewey. 
 Dewey’s pragmatism forms the philosophical rationale for the primary role of personal 
experience in experiential learning. Common to all three traditions of experiential 
learning is the emphasis on development toward a life of purpose and self-direction as 
the organizing principle for education. Piaget’s distinctive contributions to experiential 
learning are his description of the learning process as a dialectic between assimilating 
experience into concepts and accommodating concepts to experience, and his work 
on  epistemology—the relationship between the structure of knowledge and how it is 
learned.
These themes suggest guiding principles for current and emerging applications of expe-
riential learning theory. In the case of social policy and action, experiential learning can 
be the basis for constructive efforts to promote access to and influence on the dominant 
technological/symbolic culture for those who have previously been excluded: minorities, 
the poor, workers, women, people in developing countries, and those in the arts. In com-
petence-based education, experiential learning offers the theory of learning most appro-
priate for the assessment of prior learning and for the design of competence- centered 
curricula. Lifelong learning and career-development programs can find in experiential 
learning theory a conceptual rationale and guiding philosophy as well as practical edu-
cational tools. Finally, experiential learning suggests the principles for the conduct of 
experiential education in its many forms and for the design of curricula implementing 
Bruner’s manifesto: “Any subject can be respectably taught at any level.”
18 
Experiential Learning
In all these applications it is important to recognize that experiential learning is not a series 
of techniques to be applied in current practice but a program for profoundly  re-creating 
our personal lives and social systems. William Torbert puts the issue this way:
In seeking to organize experiential learning, we must recognize that we are step-
ping beyond the personally, institutionally, and epistemologically preconstituted 
universe and that we deeply resist this initiative, no matter how often we have 
returned to it. We must recognize too that the art of organizing through living 
inquiry—the art of continually exploring beyond pre-constituted universes and 
continually constructing and enacting universes in concert with others—is as 
yet a publicly undiscovered art. To treat the dilemma of organizing experiential

learning on any lesser scale is to doom ourselves to frustration, isolation or 
 failure. [1979, p. 42]  
 The Dewey, Lewin, and Piagetian traditions of experiential learning have produced a 
remarkable variety of vital and innovative programs. In their brief histories, these tradi-
tions have had a profound effect on education and the learning process. The influence 
of these ideas has been felt in formal education at all levels, in public and private orga-
nizations in this country and around the world, and in the personal lives of countless 
adult learners. Yet the future holds even greater challenges and opportunities. For these 
challenges to be successfully met, it is essential that these traditions learn from one 
another and cooperate to create a sound theoretical base from which to govern practice. 
Although in practice these traditions can appear very different—a student internship, a 
business simulation, a sensitivity training group, an action research project, a discovery 
curriculum in elementary science study—there is an underlying unity in the nature of 
the learning process on which they are based. It is to an examination of that process that 
we now turn. 
 Update and Reflections  
 Foundational Scholars of Experiential Learning Theory 
 nanos gigantum humeris insidentes 
If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. 
 —Isaac Newton 
 Chapter 1 described the conceptual foundations of experiential learning theory (ELT) 
with particular emphasis on the works of John Dewey, Kurt Lewin, and Jean Piaget 
who at the time were the particular scholars who informed my research on experien-
tial  learning and learning style. I also included other scholars—William James, Carl 
Rogers, Paulo Freire, Lev Vygotsky and Carl Jung—who influenced the development 
of other parts of the theory. I discovered Mary Parker Follett some time after the book 
was published and have used her work ever since. From their varied professions and 
cultural perspectives, these great Western scholars have had a profound impact on our 
thinking about learning and development, challenging and inspiring us to better ways 
of learning and growing as human beings. Their contributions span 100 years begin-
ning at the end of the nineteenth century with William James, John Dewey, and Mary 
Parker Follett and ending at the end of the twentieth century with the deaths of Carl 
Rogers and Paulo Freire (refer to Figure 1.3 on page 29). In spite of the Western origins 
of their work, their influence today is global; East and West, North and South. Their 
approaches were in many respects more consistent with the East Asian Confucian and 
20 
Experiential Learning
Taoist spiritual traditions that were shaped by the 5,000-year-old Chinese text Yijing  
(易經—the Book of Changes (Trinh and Kolb, 2011). Jung in particular was influenced 
in his later years by Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism, concluding that development 
toward integration and individuation is central to all religions. James also studied East-
ern thought and his radical empiricism became a central focus for the Japanese philoso-
pher Kitaro Nishida (1911).
Liminal Scholars
I was first attracted to the ideas of these scholars, delighted in discovering one piece after 
another of the puzzle of learning from experience. Their work opened my eyes to things 
that had never occurred to me. Later, as I explored how they lived and did their work, I 
found much to be inspired by and emulate. A remarkable similarity among these nine 
scholars, aside from their shared view of the importance of experience in learning, is that 
they all are what I call liminal scholars, standing at the boundaries of the mainstream 
establishment of their fields and working from theoretical and methodical perspectives 
that ran counter to the prevailing scientific norms of their time. As a result, it is only 
in recent years that their ideas have reemerged to influence learning, education, and 
development.
Mary Parker Follett, 1868–1933, for example, was awarded a Lifetime Achievement 
Award by the International Leadership Association in 2011—78 years after her death. 
She graduated ‘summa cum laude’ from Radcliff College but was not allowed to pursue 
a Ph.D. because she was a woman. She was a broad thinker who spanned disciplines 
and schools of thought, challenging her academic colleagues to think outside their dis-
ciplinary boxes. True to her theory of relations, she refused to identify with any par-
ticular school of thought but stood in “the space between” drawing insights from both 
perspectives. For example, while many see her as a Gestalt theorist along with Lewin, 
she drew from both Gestalt theory and the opposing school of behaviorism in creating 
her approach. While she was a popular lecturer and writer in her day, Peter Drucker 
observed that “she gradually became ‘non-person’” after her death in 1933. Her radi-
cal circular theory of power that emphasized cooperation and humanistic ideas about 
management and organizations was foreign to the culture of management in the 1930s 
and 40s. Today she has gained new recognition as a foundational figure. According to 
Warren Bennis, “Just about everything written today about leadership and organizations 
comes from Mary Parker Follett’s writings and lectures” (Smith, 2002).
William James also found himself outside of the mainstream of behaviorist psychol-
ogy with examination of conscious experience in his two-volume magnum opus The 
 Principles of Psychology. He devotes the last two thirds of the work to what he called 
the “study of the mind from within” (James, 1890, p. 225). Today, “his ideas about con-
sciousness have been resurrected by modern neuroscientists such as Karl Pribram and 
Roger Sperry who drew on James’ work for their own formulations. The geneticist Fran-
21
Chapter 1 The Foundations of Contemporary Approaches to Experiential Learning 
cis Crick, reviewing the philosophical implications of biological advances in our under-
standing of consciousness, has invoked James as a guiding philosopher who had said it 
all a hundred years ago” (Taylor and Wozniak, 1996, p. xxxii). His examination of the 
role of attention in conscious experience and his ideo-motor theory of action, addressing 
how consciousness of one’s learning process can be used to intentionally improve learn-
ing, were foundational for the later work on metacognition and deliberate experiential 
learning described in the Chapter 8 Update and Reflections. He is also recognized as the 
founder of the contemporary concept of dual processing theories (Evans, 2008) derived 
from his dual knowledge concepts of apprehension and comprehension.
Lev Vygotsky, whose prodigious brilliantly creative career was ended prematurely by 
his death from tuberculosis at age 38, was called the Mozart of psychology by Stephen 
Toulmin. This is in spite of the fact that he never had any formal training in psychology, 
being interested in literature, poetry, and philosophy when he was young. The Soviet 
authorities of his time kept him under pressure to toe the ideological Marxist line in his 
theories, and after his death the government repudiated his ideas. Today, however, his 
work is hugely influential in education around the world (Tharpe and Gallimore, 1988), 
and his ideas about the role of culture in the development of thought are widely cited 
as foundational for liberation ideologies, social constructionism, and activity theory 
(Bruner, 1986; Holman, Pavlica, and Thorpe, 1997).
These scholars not only studied experiential learning; they lived it. They approached 
their scientific inquiry as learning from experience, examining their own personal expe-
rience, using careful observation, building sophisticated and creative theoretical systems, 
bringing a passionate advocacy for their ideas for the betterment of humanity. I suspect 
they would all subscribe to Carl Rogers’ description of his approach to research, “I have 
come to see both research and theory as being aimed toward the inward ordering of sig-
nificant experience. Thus research is not something esoteric, nor an activity in which one 
engages to gain professional kudos. It is the persistent, disciplined effort to make sense 
and order out of the phenomena of subjective experience. Such effort is justified because 
it is satisfying to perceive the world as having order and because rewarding results often 
ensue when one understands the orderly relationships which appear to exist in nature. 
One of these rewarding results is that the ordering of one segment of experience in a 
theory immediately opens up new vistas of inquiry, research, and thought, thus leading 
one continually forward. (I have, at times, carried on research for purposes other than 
the above to satisfy others, to convince opponents and sceptics, to gain prestige, and for 
other unsavory reasons. These errors in judgment and activity have only deepened the 
above positive conviction.)” (1959, p. 188).
Most, like Rogers, also chaffed at the confines of conventional disciplinary inquiry meth-
ods, “In the invitation to participate in the APA study, I have been asked to cast our theo-
retical thinking in the terminology of the independent-intervening-dependent variable, 
in so far as this is feasible. I regret that I find this terminology somehow uncongenial.  
22 
Experiential Learning
I cannot justify my negative reaction very adequately, and perhaps it is an irrational one, 
for the logic behind these terms seems unassailable. But to me the terms seem static, they 
seem to deny the restless, dynamic, searching, changing aspects of scientific movement . . . 
The terms also seem to me to smack too much of the laboratory, where one undertakes 
an experiment de novo, with everything under control, rather than of a science which is 
endeavoring to wrest from the phenomena of experience the inherent order which they 
contain” (1959, p. 189).
Jean Piaget, for example, ignored sample sizes, statistical tests, and experimental and 
control groups in the creation of his theories. He focused instead on observations of his 
children, presenting them with cleverly designed puzzles and problems to understand 
the process of how they solved them. Unlike Binet, his mentor, and other intelligence 
researchers, he was less interested in correct answers than how children arrived at these 
answers. Not surprisingly, his successive case study technique was not well received in 
American psychology when it was introduced in 1926. However, by the 1950s with the 
rise of cognitive psychology and, particularly, Jerome Bruner’s generous advocacy for 
his approach, his ideas and methods gained widespread acceptance and influence in 
education.
Another inspiration for me was the passionate advocacy of many to the scholars for the bet-
terment of the world through learning. The leadership provided by John Dewey and Mary 
Parker Follett to the Progressive Movement of the 1920s focused the profound insights of 
their thinking on democracy, social justice, education, and advocacy for the needy. 
Paulo Freire was first a social activist where he developed his theories based on this work. 
His work on literacy campaigns in Brazil, later extended to other countries in South 
America and Africa, used what he called culture circles based on his theory of consci-
entiziation, the ability to problematize and take transformative action on the social, 
political, economic, and cultural realities that shape us. Culture circles in their process 
were much like Lewin’s T-groups where group participants were active participants in 
creating the topics to be explored through dialogue with the help of a coordinator. They 
differed from the T-group, however, in that their focus was on actively shaping the real-
ity of the participants’ lives, exploring topics such as the vote for illiterates, nationalism, 
political revolution in Brazilian democracy, and freedom. “The first experiments with 
the method began in 1962 involving 300 rural farmers who were taught how to read and 
write in 45 days. In 1964, 20,000 culture circles were planned to be set up. However, the 
military coup in that year interrupted Freire’s work. He was jailed for 70 days and later 
went into exile in Chile” (Nyirenda, 1996, p. 4).
Kurt Lewin’s commitment to solving social problems and conflicts was born out of his 
marginalization growing up as a Jew in the strongly anti-Semitic culture of East Prus-
sia. It continued throughout his life culminating in his creation of the Center for Group 
Dynamics at MIT and his leadership in the Commission on Community Interrelations 
(CCI), which conducted many action research projects, including The Connecticut State 
23
Chapter 1 The Foundations of Contemporary Approaches to Experiential Learning 
Interracial Commission to combat racial and religious prejudice that led to the creation 
of the T-Group (see Chapter 1, pp. 8–12). His development of the action research meth-
odology in these projects has had a great continuing influence.
Often described as the founder of social psychology, Lewin’s influence in the field is so 
pervasive that it is hard to define. Warren Bennis said simply, “. . . we are all Lewinians.” 
John Thibaut, one of Lewin’s research assistants at MIT, said, “. . . it is not so difficult to 
understand why he was influential. He had an uncanny intuition about what problems 
were important and what kinds of concepts and research situations were necessary to 
study them. And though he was obsessed with theory, he was not satisfied with the 
attainment of theoretical closures but demanded of the theory that its implications for 
human life be pursued with equal patience and zeal” (cited in Marrow, 1969, p. 189). 
Yet, paradoxically, he too was a liminal scholar, working for the most part outside the 
psychological establishment. “No prestigious university offered him an appointment. 
(His significant work was done in odd settings, such as the Cornell School of Home 
Economics and the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station.) The American Psychological 
Association never selected him for any assignment or appointed him to any important 
committee. . . .” (Marrow, 1969, p. 227).
My deep admiration for Lewin stems from the many students and colleagues he nurtured 
and developed to become outstanding scholars in their own right. His influence in the 
field came not so much from his published works, which can be hard to find, but from 
those who worked with him. He consistently put their names forward in publications. 
Jerome Frank, a graduate student of Lewin’s, describes how he accomplished this, “Each 
new idea or problem seemed to arouse him, and he was able to share his feelings with 
colleagues and juniors. . . . Seminars were held in his home, and it was hard to distinguish 
the influence of his ideas from the influence of his personality. Because Lewin could be 
critical without hurting, he stimulated creativity in all those around him. . . . He seemed 
to enjoy all kinds of human beings and, open and free as he was, shared his ideas imme-
diately—even if they were half-formed—eager for comments and reactions while the 
original idea was still being developed” (cited in  Marrow, 1969, p. 54).
Contributions to Experiential Learning
The following summary of the key contributions of the foundational scholars to expe-
riential learning can only highlight the influence of their work in experiential learning 
theory. Their respective approaches will be elaborated on in subsequent chapters.
William James (1841–1910)
In the introduction, I have already described how James, among the foundational schol-
ars, is the originator of experiential learning theory in his philosophy of radical empiri-
cism and the dual knowledge theory, knowing by apprehension (CE) and comprehension 
24 
Experiential Learning
(AC) (see Chapter 3, pp. 69–77). James proposed radical empiricism as a new philosophy 
of reality and mind that resolved the conflicts between nineteenth century rationalism 
and empiricism and integrated both sensation and thought in experience. His concept 
of pure experience helps elucidate the dual knowledge idea of concrete experience as 
present-oriented experiencing free from conceptual interpretation.
James, description of the primacy of the direct perception of Concrete Experience and 
how it is altered by transformation through the other learning modes is the first descrip-
tion of the experiential learning cycle I have found: “The instant field of the present is at 
all times what I call ‘pure experience.’ It is only virtually or potentially either object or 
subject as yet. For the time being it is plain, unqualified actuality, or existence, a simple 
that (CE). In this naïf immediacy it is of course valid; it is there, we act upon it (AE); and 
the doubling of it in retrospection into a state of mind and a reality intended thereby 
(RO), is just one of the acts. The ‘state of mind’ first treated explicitly as such in retro-
spection will stand corrected or confirmed (AC), and the retrospective experience in its 
turn will get a similar treatment; but the immediate experience in its passing is always 
‘truth,’ practical truth, something to act on, at its own moment. If the world were then 
and there to go out like a candle, it would remain truth absolute and objective, for it 
would be the ‘last word,’ would have no critic, and no one would ever oppose the thought 
in it to the reality intended” (1912, pp. 23–24).
John Dewey (1859–1952)
Dewey (1905) supported James in his theory of radical empiricism and pure experience 
against his other contemporary critics. Their ideas were foundational for the later devel-
opment of the philosophy of pragmatism with C. S. Peirce. 
In Art as Experience he also embraced a version of James, dual knowledge theory where 
self and environment are mutually transformed through a dialectic between rational 
controlled doing and what he called receptive undergoing, “Perception of relationship 
between what is done and what is undergone constitutes the work of intelligence . . . 
(1934, p. 45). Until the artist is satisfied in perception with what he is doing, he continues 
shaping and re-shaping. The making comes to an end when its result is experienced as 
good—and the experience comes not by mere intellectual and outside judgment but in 
direct perception” (1934, p. 49). 
Dewey’s contribution to experiential education began in the progressive education move-
ment he founded by establishing the laboratory schools at the University of Chicago in 
1896. The following excerpts from his article “My Pedagogic Creed” (1897) describe key 
propositions of experiential learning: 
 
1. “. . . education must be conceived as a continuing reconstruction of experience: 
. . . the process and goal of education are one and the same thing.” (13)
25
Chapter 1 The Foundations of Contemporary Approaches to Experiential Learning 
 
2. “I believe that education is a process of living and not a preparation for future 
living.” (7)
 
3. “I believe that education which does not occur through forms of life that are 
worth living for their own sake is always a poor substitute for genuine reality and 
tends to cramp and to deaden.” (7)
 
4. “I believe that interests are the signs and symptoms of growing power. I believe 
they represent dawning capacities. I believe that only through the continual and 
sympathetic observation of childhood’s interests can the adult enter into the 
child’s life and see what it is ready for.” (15)
Mary Parker Follett (1868–1933)
For Follett the keys to creativity, will, and power lie in deep experiencing. Like Dewey’s 
“undergoing,” surrendering the totality of one’s self to each new experience, Follett 
describes, “All that I am, all that life has made me, every past experience that I have had—
woven into the tissue of my life—I must give to the new experience. . . . We integrate our 
experience, and then the richer human being that we are goes into the new experience; 
again we give our self and always by giving rise above the old self ” (1924, pp. 136–137).
True to her Gestalt influence, she saw everything in relation. Anticipating Norbert Wein-
er’s discovery of cybernetics by many years, she described how we co-create one another 
in relationship by circular response. Through circular response transactions we create 
each other. In this co-creation, she describes how we can meet together in experience to 
evoke learning and development in one another: “. . . the essence of experience, the law 
of relation, is reciprocal freeing: here is the ‘rock and the substance of the human spirit.’ 
This is the truth of stimulus and response: evocation. We are all rooted in that great 
unknown in which are the infinite latents of humanity. And these latents are evoked, 
called forth into visibility, summoned, by the action and reaction of one on the other. 
All human interaction should be the evocation by each from the other of new forms 
undreamed of before, and all intercourse that is not evocation should be eschewed. 
Release, evocation—evocation by release, release by evocation—this is the fundamental 
law of the universe. . . . To free the energies of the human spirit is the high potentiality of 
all human association.” Mary Parker Follett along with Carl Rogers, Lev Vygotsky, and 
Paulo Freire all gave a central place to the relationship between educator and learner in 
their theories (see Chapter 7 Update and Reflections).
Kurt Lewin (1890–1947)
I have described Lewin’s major practical contributions to experiential learning, the 
T-Group laboratory method, and action research in EL Chapter 1. Lewin’s concept of the 
life space that describes subjective experience as a holistic field of forces is the most sys-
tematic framework for describing experience even to this day. Based on his field theory 
26 
Experiential Learning
using mathematical concepts of topography, he describes the life space as the totality of 
the situation as the person experiences it at a moment in time. The life space is a field of 
interdependent forces including needs, goals, memories, as well as events in the environ-
ment, barriers, and pathways. Lewin believed that behavior was shaped by contemporary 
causation. Only those forces present in the here-and-now influenced behavior. The life 
space conception was inspirational for the experiential learning theory concept of learn-
ing spaces described in the Chapter 7 Update and Reflections.
Jean Piaget (1896–1980)
Piaget’s constructivism describes the child’s development from less to more complex 
discrete stages of thinking driven by the dialectic tension between previous information 
acquired through the process of assimilation and the accommodation of existing cogni-
tive structures to new information. While his account portrays a linear developmental 
continuum with stages roughly equivalent to the child’s age (as described in Chapter 2, 
pp. 54–55), I modified his scheme in its incorporation into experiential learning theory 
to depict it within the learning cycle (see Figure 2.3) to indicate that development beyond 
adolescence involves the integration of abstract cognitive frameworks with experience 
(see Chapter 6, pp. 201–205 and Update and Reflections). 
The educational implications of constructivism, that learning is best facilitated by a 
process that draws out the students’ beliefs and ideas about a topic so that they can 
be examined, tested, and integrated with new, more refined ideas, has had a profound 
impact on education at all levels all over the world (see Chapter 3 Update and Reflec-
tions). In addition, his stage theory has formed the foundation of nearly all theories of 
adult development (see Chapter 6 Update and Reflections).
Lev Vygotsky (1896–1934)
While much attention has been given to the origins of experiential learning in the con-
structivism of Piaget, less attention has been given to its basis in the social construc-
tivism of Vygotsky (Kayes, 2002). Piaget focused on the process of internal cognitive 
 development in the individual, while the focus for Vygotsky was on the historical, 
 cultural and social context of individuals in a relationship, emphasizing the “tools of 
culture” and mentoring by more knowledgeable community members. He is best known 
for his concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)—a learning space that pro-
motes the transition from a pedagogical stage, where something can be demonstrated 
with the assistance of a more knowledgeable other, to an expert stage of independent 
performance. The ZPD is based on his law of internalization where the child’s novel 
capacities begin in the interpersonal realm and are gradually transferred into the intra-
personal realm (Vygotsky, 1978). What is internalized is “mediational means” or tools 
of culture, the most important of which is language.
27
Chapter 1 The Foundations of Contemporary Approaches to Experiential Learning 
The key technique for accomplishing this transition is called “scaffolding.” In scaffolding 
the educator tailors the learning process to the individual needs and developmental level 
of the learner. Scaffolding provides the structure and support necessary to progressively 
build knowledge. The model of teaching around the cycle described above provides a 
framework for this scaffolding process. When an educator has a personal relationship 
with a learner, he or she can skillfully intervene to reinforce or alter a learner’s pattern of 
interaction with the world (see Chapter 7 Update and Reflections). 
Carl Jung (1875–1961)
Carl Jung was arguably the most radical scientific experiential learner; deriving most 
of his theory from deep engagement with his intense personal experiences, dreams, 
and unconscious symbols. This is particularly true of his concept of individuation and 
the course of development from specialization to integration, which he developed as a 
result of what has been called his own mid-life crisis (Staude, 1981). In 1913 Jung expe-
rienced a frightening confrontation with his unconscious—seeing visions and hearing 
voices. In 1914 he began a courageous self-experimentation using a technique he called 
active imagination to explore and dialogue with himself about the dreams, symbols, and 
associations that came to him. He recorded these over the course of 16 years in a series 
of notebooks that later became the Red Book or Liber Novus (Jung, 2009) as he called 
it. Liber Novus outlines his general theory of individuation based on his descriptions of 
his own process of individuation that ultimately integrated the two personalities that he 
was aware of since he was a child. Personality 1 was the school boy living in the conven-
tional eighteenth-century world, which Jung called “the spirit of this time.” Personality 2 
pursued religious reflections and solitude in tune with nature and the cosmos, which he 
called “the spirit of the depths.” Using the technique of active imagination, he established 
dialogues with fantasy figures from the collective unconscious, bringing them into con-
sciousness to integrate with the spirit of the modern age. “If I speak in the spirit of this 
time I must say: no one and nothing can justify what I must proclaim to you. Justification 
is superfluous to me, since I have no choice, but I must. I have learned that in addition 
to the spirit of this time there is still another spirit at work, namely that which rules the 
depths of everything contemporary. The spirit of this time would like to hear of use and 
value. But the other spirit forces me nevertheless to speak, beyond justification, use and 
meaning. Filled with human pride and blinded by the presumptuous spirit of the times, 
I long sought to hold the other spirit away from me. But I did not consider that the spirit 
of the depths from time immemorial and for all the future possesses a greater power 
than the spirit of this time, who changes with the generations. The spirit of the depth has 
subjugated all pride and arrogance to the power of judgment. He took away my belief in 
science, he robbed me of the joy of explaining and ordering things, and let devotion to 
the ideals of this time die out in me. He forced me down to the last and simplest things” 
(Jung, 2009, pp. 119–120).
28 
Experiential Learning
Jung’s concept of individuation, the process of integrating opposites including the con-
scious with the unconscious, the dialectic psychological types of introversion and extra-
version, thinking and feeling, etc., in order for a person to become whole, forms the basis 
of the experiential learning theory of development described in Chapters 6 and 8.
Carl Rogers (1902–1987)
Rogers’ work has had three major influences on experiential learning theory. The first 
influence is his focus on experiencing as central to the fully functioning person and its 
importance for learning and change. This experiencing process is fluid and flexible based 
on the particular moment. It is highly differentiated with the locus of evaluation within 
the person. There is “a letting oneself down into the immediacy of what one is experienc-
ing, endeavoring to sense and to clarify all its complex meanings . . . For there is involved 
in the present moment of experiencing the memory traces of all the relevant learnings 
from the past” (Rogers, 1964, p. 164). 
The second influence is his identification of unconditional positive regard, respect, and 
psychological safety as essential conditions for a therapeutic or educational environment 
to promote learning and development. Under these conditions individuals develop a 
sense of self-worth: “One way of assisting the individual to move toward openness to 
experience is through a relationship in which he is prized as a separate person, in which 
the experiencing going on within him is empathically understood and valued and in 
which he is given the freedom to experience his own feelings and those of others without 
being threatened in doing so” (Rogers, 1964, p. 165).
The third influence is his theory of development toward self-actualization based on the 
individual’s capacity for deep experiencing. In youth, individuals tend to introject the 
values of loved ones in order to gain their respect and approval. “He learns to have a 
basic distrust for his own experiencing as a guide to his behavior. He learns from others 
a large number of conceived values and adopts them as his own, even though they may 
be widely discrepant from what he is experiencing” (Rogers, 1964, p. 162). Development 
toward genuine experiencing occurs when, in the growth producing climate described 
above, “he can slowly begin to value the different aspects of himself. Most importantly, 
he can begin, with much difficulty at first, to sense and feel what is going on within him, 
what he is feeling, what he is experiencing, how he is reacting. He uses his experiencing 
as a direct referent to which he can turn in forming accurate conceptualizations and as 
a guide to his behavior” (Rogers, 1964, p. 163; see Chapter 6 Update and Reflections).
Paulo Freire (1921–1997)
Paulo Freire’s great contribution to experiential learning theory is his theory of naming 
experience in a dialogue among equals; working with one another in a respectful and 
democratic way a to achieve a deeper understanding of their lived experiences in order 
29
Chapter 1 The Foundations of Contemporary Approaches to Experiential Learning 
to achieve praxis, making a difference in their world. He contrasted this educational 
approach to the “banking concept of education” where ideas are deposited in learners’ 
heads. 
 Freire’s work was inspirational for us in the creation of our theory of conversational 
learning in  Conversational Learning: An Experiential Approach to Knowledge Creation 
(Baker, Jensen, and Kolb, 2002). We had a chance to work with him in 1994 in one of his 
last U.S. appearances before his death. He was the keynote speaker and workshop leader 
in  The International Experiential Learning Conference: A Global Conversation about 
Learning  jointly sponsored by The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, The 
International Consortium for Experiential Learning, and The National Society for Expe-
riential Education. Our CWRU Organizational Behavior Department designed a plan to 
conduct the Conference in terms of the principles of conversational learning and Freire’s 
dialogue culture groups. The 1,500 participants were divided into diverse 10–12 person 
Exploration and Reflection groups that met regularly with a facilitator throughout the 
conference presentations and workshops. The aim was to counter-balance the “banking” 
format typical of most conventions and conferences with good conversation. In Freire’s 
sessions, he modeled dialogue and conversation with other conference participants.

The Process of Experiential Learning
We shall not cease from exploration  
And the end of all our exploring  
Will be to arrive where we started  
And know the place for the first time.
 —T.S. Eliot, Four Quartets*
E
xperiential learning theory offers a fundamentally different view of the learning 
process from that of the behavioral theories of learning based on an empirical 
epistemology or the more implicit theories of learning that underlie traditional 
educational methods, methods that for the most part are based on a rational, idealist 
epistemology. From this different perspective emerge some very different prescriptions 
for the conduct of education; the proper relationships among learning, work, and other 
life activities; and the creation of knowledge itself.
This perspective on learning is called “experiential” for two reasons. The first is to tie it 
clearly to its intellectual origins in the work of Dewey, Lewin, and Piaget. The second 
reason is to emphasize the central role that experience plays in the learning process. This 
differentiates experiential learning theory from rationalist and other cognitive theo-
ries of learning that tend to give primary emphasis to acquisition, manipulation, and 
recall of abstract symbols, and from behavioral learning theories that deny any role for 
consciousness and subjective experience in the learning process. It should be empha-
sized, however, that the aim of this work is not to pose experiential learning theory as 
a third alternative to behavioral and cognitive learning theories, but rather to suggest 
through experiential learning theory a holistic integrative perspective on learning that 
combines experience, perception, cognition, and behavior. This chapter will describe the

Experiential Learning
 learning models of Lewin, Dewey, and Piaget and identify the common characteristics 
they share— characteristics that serve to define the nature of experiential learning.
Three Models of the Experiential Learning Process
The Lewinian Model of Action Research and Laboratory Training
In the techniques of action research and the laboratory method, learning, change, and 
growth are seen to be facilitated best by an integrated process that begins with here-and-
now experience followed by collection of data and observations about that experience. 
The data are then analyzed and the conclusions of this analysis are fed back to the actors 
in the experience for their use in the modification of their behavior and choice of new 
experiences. Learning is thus conceived as a four-stage cycle, as shown in Figure 2.1. 
Immediate concrete experience is the basis for observation and reflection. These obser-
vations are assimilated into a “theory” from which new implications for action can be 
deduced. These implications or hypotheses then serve as guides in acting to create new 
experiences.
Two aspects of this learning model are particularly noteworthy. First is its emphasis 
on here-and-now concrete experience to validate and test abstract concepts. Immediate 
personal experience is the focal point for learning, giving life, texture, and subjective per-
sonal meaning to abstract concepts and at the same time providing a concrete, publicly 
shared reference point for testing the implications and validity of ideas created during 
the learning process. When human beings share an experience, they can share it fully, 
concretely, and abstractly.

Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
Second, action research and laboratory training are based on feedback processes. Lewin 
borrowed the concept of feedback from electrical engineering to describe a social learn-
ing and problem-solving process that generates valid information to assess deviations 
from desired goals. This information feedback provides the basis for a continuous pro-
cess of goal-directed action and evaluation of the consequences of that action. Lewin and 
his followers believed that much individual and organizational ineffectiveness could be 
traced ultimately to a lack of adequate feedback processes. This ineffectiveness results 
from an imbalance between observation and action—either from a tendency for individ-
uals and organizations to emphasize decision and action at the expense of information 
gathering, or from a tendency to become bogged down by data collection and analysis. 
The aim of the laboratory method and action research is to integrate these two perspec-
tives into an effective, goal-directed learning process.
Dewey’s Model of Learning
John Dewey’s model of the learning process is remarkably similar to the Lewinian model, 
although he makes more explicit the developmental nature of learning implied in Lewin’s 
conception of it as a feedback process by describing how learning transforms the impulses, 
feelings, and desires of concrete experience into higher-order purposeful action.
The formation of purposes is, then, a rather complex intellectual operation. It 
involves: (1) observation of surrounding conditions; (2) knowledge of what has 
happened in similar situations in the past, a knowledge obtained partly by recollec-
tion and partly from the information, advice, and warning of those who have had a 
wider experience; and (3) judgment, which puts together what is observed and what 
is recalled to see what they signify. A purpose differs from an original impulse and 
desire through its translation into a plan and method of action based upon foresight 
of the consequences of action under given observed conditions in a certain way. . . . 
The crucial educational problem is that of procuring the postponement of immedi-
ate action upon desire until observation and judgment have intervened. . . . Mere 
foresight, even if it takes the form of accurate prediction, is not, of course, enough. 
The intellectual anticipation, the idea of consequences, must blend with desire and 
impulse to acquire moving force. It then gives direction to what otherwise is blind, 
while desire gives ideas impetus and momentum. [Dewey, 1938, p. 69]
Dewey’s model of experiential learning is graphically portrayed in Figure 2.2. We note in 
his description of learning a similarity with Lewin, in the emphasis on learning as a dia-
lectic process integrating experience and concepts, observations, and action. The impulse 
of experience gives ideas their moving force, and ideas give direction to impulse. Post-
ponement of immediate action is essential for observation and judgment to  intervene, 
and action is essential for achievement of purpose. It is through the integration of these 
opposing but symbiotically related processes that sophisticated, mature purpose devel-
ops from blind impulse.
34 
Experiential Learning
Piaget’s Model of Learning and Cognitive Development
For Jean Piaget, the dimensions of experience and concept, reflection, and action 
form the basic continua for the development of adult thought. Development from 
infancy to adulthood moves from a concrete phenomenal view of the world to an 
abstract constructionist view, from an active egocentric view to a reflective internalized 
mode of knowing. Piaget also maintained that these have been the major directions 
of development in scientific knowledge (Piaget, 1970). The learning process whereby 
this development takes place is a cycle of interaction between the individual and the 
environment that is similar to the learning models of Dewey and Lewin. In Piaget’s 
terms, the key to learning lies in the mutual interaction of the process of accommoda-
tion of concepts or schemas to experience in the world and the process of assimilation 
of events and experiences from the world into existing concepts and schemas. Learn-
ing or, in Piaget’s term, intelligent adaptation results from a balanced tension between 
these two processes. When accommodation processes dominate assimilation, we have 
imitation—the molding of oneself to environmental contours or constraints. When 
assimilation predominates over accommodation, we have play—the imposition of one’s 
concept and images without regard to environmental realities. The process of cognitive 
growth from concrete to abstract and from active to reflective is based on this continual 
transaction between assimilation and accommodation, occurring in successive stages, 
each of which incorporates what has gone before into a new, higher level of cognitive 
functioning.
Piaget’s work has identified four major stages of cognitive growth that emerge from birth 
to about the age of 14–16. In the first stage (0–2 years), the child is predominantly  concrete 
and active in his learning style. This stage is called the sensory-motor stage. Learning is 
predominantly enactive through feeling, touching, and handling.  Representation is based 
on action—for example, “a hole is to dig.” Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of this 
period is the development of goal-oriented behavior: “The sensory-motor period shows

Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
a remarkable evolution from nonintentional habits to experimental and exploratory 
activity which is obviously intentional or goal oriented” (Flavell, 1963, p. 107). Yet the 
child has few schemes or theories into which he can assimilate events, and as a result, 
his primary stance toward the world is accommodative. Environment plays a major role 
in shaping his ideas and intentions. Learning occurs primarily through the association 
between stimulus and response.
In the second stage of cognitive growth (2–6 years), the child retains his concrete orien-
tation but begins to develop a reflective orientation as he begins to internalize actions, 
converting them to images. This is called the representational stage. Learning is now 
predominantly iconic in nature, through the manipulation of observations and images. 
The child is now freed somewhat from his immersion in immediate experience and, as 
a result, is free to play with and manipulate his images of the world. At this stage, the 
child’s primary stance toward the world is divergent. He is captivated with his ability 
to collect images and to view the world from different perspectives. Consider Bruner’s 
description of the child at this stage:
What appears next in development is a great achievement. Images develop an 
autonomous status, they become great summarizers of action. By age three the 
child has become a paragon of sensory distractibility. He is victim of the laws of 
vividness, and his action pattern is a series of encounters with this bright thing 
which is then replaced by that chromatically splendid one, which in turn gives 
way to the next noisy one. And so it goes. Visual memory at this stage seems to 
be highly concrete and specific. What is intriguing about this period is that the 
child is a creature of the moment; the image of the moment is sufficient and it is 
controlled by a single feature of the situation. [Bruner, 1966b, p. 13]
In the third stage of cognitive growth (7–11 years), the intensive development of abstract 
symbolic powers begins. The first symbolic developmental stage Piaget calls the stage of 
concrete operations. Learning in this stage is governed by the logic of classes and rela-
tions. The child in this stage further increases his independence from his immediate 
experiential world through the development of inductive powers:
The structures of concrete operations are, to use a homely analogy, rather like 
parking lots whose individual parking spaces are now occupied and now empty; 
the spaces themselves endure, however, and leave their owner to look beyond the 
cars actually present toward potential, future occupants of the vacant and to-be-
vacant spaces. [Flavell, 1963, p. 203]
Thus, in contrast to the child in the sensory-motor stage whose learning style was domi-
nated by accommodative processes, the child at the stage of concrete operations is more 
assimilative in his learning style. He relies on concepts and theories to select and give 
shape to his experiences.
36 
Experiential Learning
Piaget’s final stage of cognitive development comes with the onset of adolescence  (12–15 
years). In this stage, the adolescent moves from symbolic processes based on concrete 
operations to the symbolic processes of representational logic, the stage of formal 
operations. He now returns to a more active orientation, but it is an active orientation 
that is now modified by the development of the reflective and abstract power that pre-
ceded it. The symbolic powers he now possesses enable him to engage in hypothetico- 
deductive reasoning. He develops the possible implications of his theories and proceeds 
to  experimentally test which of these are true. Thus his basic learning style is convergent, 
in contrast to the divergent orientation of the child in the representational stage:
We see, then, that formal thought is for Piaget not so much this or that specific 
behavior as it is a generalized orientation, sometimes explicit and sometimes 
implicit, towards problem solving; an orientation towards organizing data (com-
binatorial analysis), towards isolation and control of variables, towards the hypo-
thetical, and towards logical justification and proof. [Flavell, 1963, p. 211]

mental processes that shape the basic learning process of adults (see Figure 2.3).

Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
Characteristics of Experiential Learning
There is a great deal of similarity among the models of the learning process discussed 
above.1 Taken together, they form a unique perspective on learning and development, a 
perspective that can be characterized by the following propositions, which are shared by 
the three major traditions of experiential learning.
Learning Is Best Conceived as a Process, Not in Terms of Outcomes
The emphasis on the process of learning as opposed to the behavioral outcomes distin-
guishes experiential learning from the idealist approaches of traditional education and 
from the behavioral theories of learning created by Watson, Hull, Skinner, and others. 
The theory of experiential learning rests on a different philosophical and epistemological 
base from behaviorist theories of learning and idealist educational approaches. Modern 
versions of these latter approaches are based on the empiricist philosophies of Locke 
and others. This epistemology is based on the idea that there are elements of conscious-
ness—mental atoms, or, in Locke’s term, “simple ideas”—that always remain the same. 
The various combinations and associations of these consistent elements form our varying 
patterns of thought. It is the notion of constant, fixed elements of thought that has had 
such a profound effect on prevailing approaches to learning and education, resulting in a 
tendency to define learning in terms of its outcomes, whether these be knowledge in an 
accumulated storehouse of facts or habits representing behavioral responses to specific 
stimulus conditions. If ideas are seen to be fixed and immutable, then it seems possible to 
measure how much someone has learned by the amount of these fixed ideas the person 
has accumulated.
Experiential learning theory, however, proceeds from a different set of assumptions. Ideas 
are not fixed and immutable elements of thought but are formed and re-formed through 
experience. In all three of the learning models just reviewed, learning is described as a 
process whereby concepts are derived from and continuously modified by experience. 
No two thoughts are ever the same, since experience always intervenes. Piaget (1970), for 
example, considers the creation of new knowledge to be the central problem of genetic 
epistemology, since each act of understanding is the result of a process of continuous 
construction and invention through the interaction processes of assimilation and accom-
modation (see Chapter 5, p. 153). Learning is an emergent process whose outcomes 
represent only historical record, not knowledge of the future.
When viewed from the perspective of experiential learning, the tendency to define learn-
ing in terms of outcomes can become a definition of nonlearning, in the process sense 
that the failure to modify ideas and habits as a result of experience is maladaptive. The 
clearest example of this irony lies in the behaviorist axiom that the strength of a habit 
1. There are also points of disagreement, which will be explored more fully in the next chapter.
38 
Experiential Learning
can be measured by its resistance to extinction. That is, the more I have “learned” a 
given habit, the longer I will persist in behaving that way when it is no longer rewarded. 
Similarly, there are those who feel that the orientations that conceive of learning in terms 
of outcomes as opposed to a process of adaptation have had a negative effect on the 
educational system. Jerome Bruner, in his influential book, Toward a Theory of Instruc-
tion, makes the point that the purpose of education is to stimulate inquiry and skill in 
the process of knowledge getting, not to memorize a body of knowledge: “Knowing is 
a process, not a product” (1966, p. 72). Paulo Freire calls the orientation that conceives 
of education as the transmission of fixed content the “banking” concept of education:
Education thus becomes an act of depositing, in which the students are the 
depositories and the teacher is the depositor. Instead of communicating, the 
teacher issues communiques and makes deposits which the students patiently 
receive, memorize, and repeat. This is the “banking” concept of education, in 
which the scope of action allowed to the students extends only as far as receiv-
ing, filing, and storing the deposits. They do, it is true, have the opportunity to 
become collectors or cataloguers of the things they store. But in the last analysis, 
it is men themselves who are filed away through the lack of creativity, trans-
formation, and knowledge in this (at best) misguided system. For apart from 
inquiry, apart from the praxis, men cannot be truly human. Knowledge emerges 
only through invention and reinvention, through the restless, impatient, con-
tinuing, hopeful inquiry men pursue in the world, with the world, and with each 
other. [Friere, 1974, p. 58]
Learning Is a Continuous Process Grounded in Experience
Knowledge is continuously derived from and tested out in the experiences of the 
learner. William James (1890), in his studies on the nature of human consciousness, 
marveled at the fact that consciousness is continuous. How is it, he asked, that I awake 
in the morning with the same consciousness, the same thoughts, feelings, memories, 
and sense of who I am that I went to sleep with the night before? Similarly for Dewey, 
continuity of experience was a powerful truth of human existence, central to the the-
ory of learning:
. . . the principle of continuity of experience means that every experience both 
takes up something from those which have gone before and modifies in some 
way the quality of those which come after. . . . As an individual passes from one 
situation to another, his world, his environment, expands or contracts. He does 
not find himself living in another world but in a different part or aspect of one 
and the same world. What he has learned in the way of knowledge and skill in 
one situation becomes an instrument of understanding and dealing effectively 
with the situations which follow. The process goes on as long as life and learning 
continue. [Dewey, 1938, pp. 35, 44]
39
Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
Although we are all aware of the sense of continuity in consciousness and experience to 
which James and Dewey refer, and take comfort from the predictability and security it 
provides, there is on occasion in the penumbra of that awareness an element of doubt 
and uncertainty. How do I reconcile my own sense of continuity and predictability 
with what at times appears to be a chaotic and unpredictable world around me? I move 
through my daily round of tasks and meetings with a fair sense of what the issues are, of 
what others are saying and thinking, and with ideas about what actions to take. Yet I am 
occasionally upended by unforeseen circumstances, miscommunications, and dreadful 
miscalculations. It is in this interplay between expectation and experience that learning 
occurs. In Hegel’s phrase, “Any experience that does not violate expectation is not wor-
thy of the name experience.” And yet somehow, the rents that these violations cause in 
the fabric of my experience are magically repaired, and I face the next day a bit changed 
but still the same person.
That this is a learning process is perhaps better illustrated by the nonlearning postures 
that can result from the interplay between expectation and experience. To focus so 
sharply on continuity and certainty that one is blinded to the shadowy penumbra of 
doubt and uncertainty is to risk dogmatism and rigidity, the inability to learn from new 
experiences. Or conversely, to have continuity continuously shaken by the vicissitudes 
of new experience is to be left paralyzed by insecurity, incapable of effective action. 
From the perspective of epistemological philosophy, Pepper (1942) shows that both 
these postures—dogmatism and absolute skepticism—are inadequate foundations for 
the creation of valid knowledge systems. He proposes instead that an attitude of provi-
sionalism, or what he calls partial skepticism, be the guide for inquiry and learning (see 
Chapter 5, pp. 162–163).
The fact that learning is a continuous process grounded in experience has important 
educational implications. Put simply, it implies that all learning is relearning. How easy 
and tempting it is in designing a course to think of the learner’s mind as being as blank 
as the paper on which we scratch our outline. Yet this is not the case. Everyone enters 
every learning situation with more or less articulate ideas about the topic at hand. We are 
all psychologists, historians, and atomic physicists. It is just that some of our theories are 
more crude and incorrect than others. But to focus solely on the refinement and valid-
ity of these theories misses the point. The important point is that the people we teach 
have held these beliefs whatever their quality and that until now they have used them 
whenever the situation called for them to be atomic physicists, historians, or whatever.
Thus, one’s job as an educator is not only to implant new ideas but also to dispose of or 
modify old ones. In many cases, resistance to new ideas stems from their conflict with 
old beliefs that are inconsistent with them. If the education process begins by bringing 
out the learner’s beliefs and theories, examining and testing them, and then integrat-
ing the new, more refined ideas into the person’s belief systems, the learning process 
will be facilitated. Piaget (see Elkind, 1970, Chapter 3) has identified two mechanisms 
40 
Experiential Learning
2.  The concept of dialectic relationship is used advisedly in this work. The long history and changing 
usages of this term, and particularly the emotional and idealogical connotations attending its usage 
in some contexts, may cause some confusion for the reader. However, no other term expresses as well 
the relationship between learning orientations described here—that of mutually opposed and conflict-
ing processes the results of each of which cannot be explained by the other, but whose merger through 
confrontation of the conflict between them results in a higher order process that transcends and encom-
passes them both. This definition comes closest to Hegel’s use of the term but does not imply total 
acceptance of the Hegelian epistemology (compare Chapter 5, p. 155).
by which new ideas are adopted by an individual—integration and substitution. Ideas 
that evolve through integration tend to become highly stable parts of the person’s con-
ception of the world. On the other hand, when the content of a concept changes by 
means of substitution, there is always the possibility of a reversion to the earlier level of 
conceptualization and understanding, or to a dual theory of the world where espoused 
theories learned through substitution are incongruent with theories-in-use that are 
more integrated with the person’s total conceptual and attitudinal view of the world. It 
is this latter outcome that stimulated Argyris and Schon’s inquiry into the effectiveness 
of professional education:
We thought the trouble people have in learning new theories may stem not so 
much from the inherent difficulty of the new theories as from the existing theo-
ries people have that already determine practices. We call their operational theo-
ries of action theories-in-use to distinguish them from the espoused theories that 
are used to describe and justify behavior. We wondered whether the difficulty 
in learning new theories of action is related to a disposition to protect the old 
theory-in-use. [Argyris and Schon, 1974, p. viii]
The Process of Learning Requires the Resolution  
of Conflicts  between Dialectically Opposed Modes  
of Adaptation to the World
Each of the three models of experiential learning describes conflicts between opposing 
ways of dealing with the world, suggesting that learning results from resolution of these 
conflicts. The Lewinian model emphasizes two such dialectics—the conflict between 
concrete experience and abstract concepts and the conflict between observation and 
action.2 For Dewey, the major dialectic is between the impulse that gives ideas their 
“moving force” and reason that gives desire its direction. In Piaget’s framework, the twin 
processes of accommodation of ideas to the external world and assimilation of experi-
ence into existing conceptual structures are the moving forces of cognitive development. 
In Paulo Freire’s work, the dialectic nature of learning and adaptation is encompassed in 
his concept of praxis, which he defines as “reflection and action upon the world in order 
41
Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
to transform it” (1974, p. 36). Central to the concept of praxis is the process of “naming 
the world,” which is both active—in the sense that naming something transforms it—
and reflective—in that our choice of words gives meaning to the world around us. This 
process of naming the world is accomplished through dialogue among equals, a joint 
process of inquiry and learning that Freire sets against the banking concept of education 
described earlier:
As we attempt to analyze dialogue as a human phenomenon, we discover some-
thing which is the essence of dialogue itself: the word. But the word is more than 
just an instrument which makes dialogue possible; accordingly, we must seek its 
constitutive elements. Within the word we find two dimensions, reflection and 
action, in such radical interaction that if one is sacrificed—even in part—the 
other immediately suffers. There is no true word that is not at the same time a 
praxis. Thus, to speak a true word is to transform the world.
An unauthentic word, one which is unable to transform reality, results when 
dichotomy is imposed upon its constitutive elements. When a word is deprived 
of its dimension of action, reflection automatically suffers as well; and the word is 
changed into idle chatter, into verbalism, into an alienated and alienating “blah.” 
It becomes an empty word, one which cannot denounce the world, for denuncia-
tion is impossible without a commitment to transform, and there is no transfor-
mation without action.
On the other hand, if action is emphasized exclusively, to the detriment of 
reflection, the word is converted into activism. The latter—action for action’s 
sake—negates the true praxis and makes dialogue impossible. Either dichotomy, 
by creating unauthentic forms of existence, creates also unauthentic forms of 
thought, which reinforce the original dichotomy.
Human existence cannot be silent, nor can it be nourished by false words, but 
only by true words, with which men transform the world. To exist, humanly, is 
to name the world, to change it. Once named, the world in its turn reappears to 
the namers as a problem and requires of them a new naming. Men are not built 
in silence, but in word, in work, in action-reflection.
But while to say the true word—which is work, which is praxis—is to transform 
the world, saying that word is not the privilege of some few men, but the right of 
every man. Consequently, no one can say a true word alone—nor can he say it 
for another, in a prescriptive act which robs others of their words. [Freire, 1974, 
pp. 75, 76]
All the models above suggest the idea that learning is by its very nature a tension- 
and conflict-filled process. New knowledge, skills, or attitudes are achieved through 
confrontation among four modes of experiential learning. Learners, if they are to 
42 
Experiential Learning
be effective, need four different kinds of abilities—concrete experience abilities (CE), 
reflective observation abilities (RO), abstract conceptualization abilities (AC), and 
active experimentation (AE) abilities. That is, they must be able to involve themselves 
fully, openly, and without bias in new experiences (CE). They must be able to reflect 
on and observe their experiences from many perspectives (RO). They must be able to 
create concepts that integrate their observations into logically sound theories (AC), 
and they must be able to use these theories to make decisions and solve problems (AE). 
Yet this ideal is difficult to achieve. How can one act and reflect at the same time? How 
can one be concrete and immediate and still be theoretical? Learning requires abilities 
that are polar opposites, and the learner, as a result, must continually choose which 
set of learning abilities he or she will bring to bear in any specific learning situation. 
More specifically, there are two primary dimensions to the learning process. The first 
dimension represents the concrete experiencing of events at one end and abstract 
conceptualization at the other. The other dimension has active experimentation at 
one extreme and reflective observation at the other. Thus, in the process of learning, 
one moves in varying degrees from actor to observer, and from specific involvement 
to general analytic detachment.
In addition, the way in which the conflicts among the dialectically opposed modes of 
adaptation get resolved determines the level of learning that results. If conflicts are 
resolved by suppression of one mode and/or dominance by another, learning tends to 
be specialized around the dominant mode and limited in areas controlled by the domi-
nated mode. For example, in Piaget’s model, imitation is the result when accommoda-
tion processes dominate, and play results when assimilation dominates. Or for Freire, 
dominance of the active mode results in “activism,” and dominance of the reflective 
mode results in “verbalism.”
However, when we consider the higher forms of adaptation—the process of creativity 
and personal development—conflict among adaptive modes needs to be confronted 
and integrated into a creative synthesis. Nearly every account of the creative process, 
from Wallas’s (1926) four-stage model of incorporation, incubation, insight, and veri-
fication, has recognized the dialectic conflicts involved in creativity. Bruner (1966a), 
in his essay on the conditions of creativity, emphasizes the dialectic tension between 
abstract detachment and concrete involvement. For him, the creative act is a product 
of detachment and commitment, of passion and decorum, and of a freedom to be 
dominated by the object of one’s inquiry. At the highest stages of development, the 
adaptive commitment to learning and creativity produces a strong need for integra-
tion of the four adaptive modes. Development in one mode precipitates development 
in the others. Increases in symbolic complexity, for example, refine and sharpen both 
perceptual and behavioral possibilities. Thus, complexity and the integration of dia-
lectic conflicts among the adaptive modes are the hallmarks of true creativity and  
growth.

Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
Learning Is an Holistic Process of Adaptation to the World
Experiential learning is not a molecular educational concept but rather is a molar concept 
describing the central process of human adaptation to the social and physical environ-
ment. It is a holistic concept, much akin to the Jungian theory of psychological types 
(Jung, 1923), in that it seeks to describe the emergence of basic life orientations as a func-
tion of dialectic tensions between basic modes of relating to the world. To learn is not the 
special province of a single specialized realm of human functioning such as cognition or 
perception. It involves the integrated functioning of the total organism—thinking, feel-
ing, perceiving, and behaving.
This concept of holistic adaptation is somewhat out of step with current research trends 
in the behavioral sciences. Since the early years of this century and the decline of what 
Gordon Allport called the “simple and sovereign” theories of human behavior, the trend 
in the behavioral sciences has been away from theories such as those of Freud and his 
followers that proposed to explain the totality of human functioning by focusing on the 
interrelatedness among human processes such as thought, emotion, perception, and so 
on. Research has instead tended to specialize in more detailed exploration and descrip-
tion of particular processes and subprocesses of human adaptation—perception, person 
perception, attribution, achievement motivation, cognition, memory—the list could go 
on and on. The fruit of this labor has been bountiful. Because of this intensive specialized 
research, we now know a vast amount about human behavior, so much that any attempt 
to integrate and do justice to all this diverse knowledge seems impossible. Any holistic 
theory proposed today could not be simple and would certainly not be sovereign. Yet if 
we are to understand human behavior, particularly in any practical way, we must in some 
way put together all the pieces that have been so carefully analyzed. In addition to know-
ing how we think and how we feel, we must also know when behavior is governed by 
thought and when by feeling. In addition to addressing the nature of specialized human 
functions, experiential learning theory is also concerned with how these functions are 
integrated by the person into a holistic adaptive posture toward the world.
Learning is the major process of human adaptation. This concept of learning is consid-
erably broader than that commonly associated with the school classroom. It occurs in 
all human settings, from schools to the workplace, from the research laboratory to the 
management board room, in personal relationships and the aisles of the local grocery. 
It encompasses all life stages, from childhood to adolescence, to middle and old age. 
 Therefore it encompasses other, more limited adaptive concepts such as creativity, prob-
lem solving, decision making, and attitude change that focus heavily on one or another 
of the basic aspects of adaptation. Thus, creativity research has tended to focus on the 
divergent (concrete and reflective) factors in adaptation such as tolerance for ambigu-
ity, metaphorical thinking, and flexibility, whereas research on decision making has 
emphasized more convergent (abstract and active) adaptive factors such as the rational 
evaluation of solution alternatives.

 Similarities Among Conceptions of Basic Adaptive Processes: Inquiry/Research, 
Creativity, Decision Making, Problem Solving, Learning
The cyclic description of the experiential learning process is mirrored in many of the 
specialized models of the adaptive process. The common theme in all these models 
is that all forms of human adaptation approximate scientific inquiry, a point of view 
articulated most thoroughly by the late George Kelly (1955). Dewey, Lewin, and Piaget 
in one way or another seem to take the scientific method as their model for the learning 
process; or to put it another way, they see in the scientific method the highest philo-
sophical and technological refinement of the basic processes of human adaptation. The 
scientific method, thus, provides a means for describing the holistic integration of all 
human functions.
Figure 2.4 shows the experiential learning cycle in the center circle and a model of the 
scientific inquiry process in the outer circle (Kolb, 1978), with models of the problem-
45
Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
solving process (Pounds, 1965), the decision-making process (Simon, 1947), and the 
creative process (Wallas, 1926) in between. Although the models all use different terms, 
there is a remarkable similarity in concept among them. This similarity suggests that 
there may be great payoff in the integration of findings from these specialized areas into 
a single general adaptive model such as that proposed by experiential learning theory. 
Bruner’s work on a theory of instruction (1966b) shows one example of this potential 
payoff. His integration of research on cognitive processes, problem solving, and learning 
theory provided a rich new perspective for the conduct of education.
When learning is conceived as a holistic adaptive process, it provides conceptual 
bridges across life situations such as school and work, portraying learning as a con-
tinuous, lifelong process. Similarly, this perspective highlights the similarities among 
adaptive/learning activities that are commonly called by specialized names—learning, 
creativity, problem solving, decision making, and scientific research. Finally, learning 
conceived holistically includes adaptive activities that vary in their extension through 
time and space. Typically, an immediate reaction to a limited situation or problem is 
not thought of as learning but as performance. Similarly at the other extreme, we do 
not commonly think of long-term adaptations to one’s total life situation as  learning 
but as development. Yet performance, learning, and development, when viewed from 
the perspectives of experiential learning theory, form a continuum of adaptive pos-
tures to the environment, varying only in their degree of extension in time and space. 
Performance is limited to short-term adaptations to immediate circumstance, learn-
ing encompasses somewhat longer-term mastery of generic classes of situations, and 
development encompasses lifelong adaptations to one’s total life situation (compare 
Chapter 6).
Learning Involves Transactions between the Person  
and the  Environment
So stated, this proposition must seem obvious. Yet strangely enough, its implications seem 
to have been widely ignored in research on learning and practice in education, replaced 
instead by a person-centered psychological view of learning. The casual observer of the 
traditional educational process would undoubtedly conclude that learning was primarily 
a personal, internal process requiring only the limited environment of books, teacher, 
and classroom. Indeed, the wider “real-world” environment at times seems to be actively 
rejected by educational systems at all levels.
There is an analogous situation in psychological research on learning and development. 
In theory, stimulus-response theories of learning describe relationships between envi-
ronmental stimuli and responses of the organism. But in practice, most of this research 
involves treating the environmental stimuli as independent variables manipulated arti-
ficially by the experimenter to determine their effect on dependent response charac-
teristics. This approach has had two outcomes. The first is a tendency to perceive the 
46 
Experiential Learning
person-environment relationship as one-way, placing great emphasis on how environ-
ment shapes behavior with little regard for how behavior shapes the environment. Sec-
ond, the models of learning are essentially decontextualized and lacking in what Egon 
Brunswick (1943) called ecological validity. In the emphasis on scientific control of 
environmental conditions, laboratory situations were created that bore little resemblance 
to the environment of real life, resulting in empirically validated models of learning that 
accurately described behavior in these artificial settings but could not easily be general-
ized to subjects in their natural environment. It is not surprising to me that the foremost 
proponent of this theory of learning would be fascinated by the creation of Utopian 
societies such as Walden II (Skinner, 1948); for the only way to apply the results of these 
studies is to make the world a laboratory, subject to “experimenter” control (compare 
Elms, 1981).
Similar criticisms have been made of developmental psychology. Piaget’s work, for 
example, has been criticized for its failure to take account of environmental and cultural 
circumstances (Cole, 1971). Speaking of developmental psychology in general, Bron-
fenbrenner states, “Much of developmental psychology as it now exists is the science of 
the strange behavior of children in strange situations with strange adults for the briefest 
possible periods of time” (1977, p. 19).
In experiential learning theory, the transactional relationship between the person and the 
environment is symbolized in the dual meanings of the term experience—one subjective 
and personal, referring to the person’s internal state, as in “the experience of joy and 
happiness,” and the other objective and environmental, as in, “He has 20 years of experi-
ence on this job.” These two forms of experience interpenetrate and interrelate in very 
complex ways, as, for example, in the old saw, “He doesn’t have 20 years of experience, 
but one year repeated 20 times.” Dewey describes the matter this way:
Experience does not go on simply inside a person. It does go on there, for it influ-
ences the formation of attitudes of desire and purpose. But this is not the whole 
of the story. Every genuine experience has an active side which changes in some 
degree the objective conditions under which experiences are had. The difference 
between civilization and savagery, to take an example on a large scale, is found 
in the degree in which previous experiences have changed the  objective condi-
tions under which subsequent experiences take place. The existence of roads, 
of means of rapid movement and transportation, tools, implements, furniture, 
electric light and power, are illustrations. Destroy the external conditions of pres-
ent civilized experience, and for a time our experience would relapse into that of 
barbaric peoples. . . .
The word “interaction” assigns equal rights to both factors in experience— 
objective and internal conditions. Any normal experience is an interplay of these 
two sets of conditions. Taken together . . . they form what we call a situation.
47
Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
The statement that individuals live in a world means, in the concrete, that they 
live in a series of situations. And when it is said that they live in these situations, 
the meaning of the word “in” is different from its meaning when it is said that 
pennies are “in” a pocket or paint is “in” a can. It means, once more, that inter-
action is going on between an individual and objects and other persons. The 
conceptions of situation and of interaction are inseparable from each other. An 
experience is always what it is because of a transaction taking place between an 
individual and what, at the time, constitutes his environment, whether the lat-
ter consists of persons with whom he is talking about some topic or event, the 
subject talked about being also a part of the situation; the book he is reading (in 
which his environing conditions at the time may be England or ancient Greece 
or an imaginary region); or the materials of an experiment he is performing. 
The environment, in other words, is whatever conditions interact with personal 
needs, desires, purposes, and capacities to create the experience which is had. 
Even when a person builds a castle in the air he is interacting with the objects 
which he constructs in fancy. [Dewey, 1938, pp. 39, 42–43]
Although Dewey refers to the relationship between the objective and subjective condi-
tions of experience as an “interaction,” he is struggling in the last portion of the quote 
above to convey the special, complex nature of the relationship. The word transac-
tion is more appropriate than interaction to describe the relationship between the per-
son and the environment in experiential learning theory, because the connotation of 
interaction is somehow too mechanical, involving unchanging separate entities that 
become  intertwined but retain their separate identities. This is why Dewey attempts to 
give  special meaning to the word in. The concept of transaction implies a more fluid, 
 interpenetrating relationship between objective conditions and subjective experience, 
such that once they become related, both are essentially changed.
Lewin recognized this complexity, even though he chose to sidestep it in his famous 
theoretical formulation, B = f (P, E), indicating that behavior is a function of the person 
and the environment without any specification as to the specific mathematical nature 
of that function. The position taken in this work is similar to that of Bandura (1978)—
namely, that personal characteristics, environmental influences, and behavior all operate 
in reciprocal determination, each factor influencing the others in an interlocking fashion. 
The concept of reciprocally determined transactions between person and learning envi-
ronment is central to the laboratory-training method of experiential learning. Learning 
in T-groups is seen to result not simply from responding to a fixed environment but 
from the active creation by the learners of situations that meet their learning objectives:
The essence of this learning experience is a transactional process in which the 
members negotiate as each attempts to influence or control the stream of events 
and to satisfy his personal needs. Individuals learn to the extent that they expose 
their needs, values, and behavior patterns so that perceptions and reactions can 
48 
Experiential Learning
be exchanged. Behavior thus becomes the currency for transaction. The amount 
each invests helps to determine the return. [Bradford, 1964, p. 192]
Learning in this sense is an active, self-directed process that can be applied not only in 
the group setting but in everyday life.
Learning Is the Process of Creating Knowledge
To understand learning, we must understand the nature and forms of human knowledge 
and the processes whereby this knowledge is created. It has already been emphasized 
that this process of creation occurs at all levels of sophistication, from the most advanced 
forms of scientific research to the child’s discovery that a rubber ball bounces. Knowl-
edge is the result of the transaction between social knowledge and personal knowl-
edge. The former, as Dewey noted, is the civilized objective accumulation of previous 
human cultural experience, whereas the latter is the accumulation of the individual 
person’s subjective life experiences. Knowledge results from the transaction between 
these objective and subjective experiences in a process called learning. Hence, to under-
stand knowledge, we must understand the psychology of the learning process, and to 
understand learning, we must understand epistemology—the origins, nature, methods, 
and limits of knowledge. Piaget makes the following comments on these last points:
Psychology thus occupies a key position, and its implications become increas-
ingly clear. The very simple reason for this is that if the sciences of nature explain 
the human species, humans in turn explain the sciences of nature, and it is up to 
psychology to show us how. Psychology, in fact, represents the junction of two 
opposite directions of scientific thought that are dialectically complementary. It 
follows that the system of sciences cannot be arranged in a linear order, as many 
people beginning with Auguste Comte have attempted to arrange them. The 
form that characterizes the system of sciences is that of a circle, or more precisely 
that of a spiral as it becomes ever larger. In fact, objects are known only through 
the subject, while the subject can know himself or herself only by acting on 
objects materially and mentally. Indeed, if objects are innumerable and science 
indefinitely diverse, all knowledge of the subject brings us back to psychology, 
the science of the subject and the subject’s actions.
. . . it is impossible to dissociate psychology from epistemology . . . how is knowl-
edge acquired, how does it increase, and how does it become organized or reor-
ganized? . . . The answers we find, and from which we can only choose by more 
or less refining them, are necessarily of the following three types: Either knowl-
edge comes exclusively from the object, or it is constructed by the subject alone, 
or it results from multiple interactions between the subject and the object—but 
what interactions and in what form? Indeed, we see at once that these are epis-
temological solutions stemming from empiricism, apriorism, or diverse inter-
actionism. . . . [Piaget, 1978, p. 651]

Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
It is surprising that few learning and cognitive researchers other than Piaget have recog-
nized the intimate relationship between learning and knowledge and hence recognized 
the need for epistemological as well as psychological inquiry into these related pro-
cesses. In my own research and practice with experiential learning, I have been impressed 
with the very practical ramifications of the epistemological perspective. In teaching, for 
example, I have found it essential to take into account the nature of the subject matter 
in deciding how to help students learn the material at hand. Trying to develop skills in 
empathic listening is a different educational task, requiring a different teaching approach 
from that of teaching fundamentals of statistics. Similarly, in consulting work with orga-
nizations, I have often seen barriers to communication and problem solving that at root 
are epistemologically based—that is, based on conflicting assumptions about the nature 
of knowledge and truth.
The theory of experiential learning provides a perspective from which to approach 
these practical problems, suggesting a typology of different knowledge systems that 
results from the way the dialectic conflicts between adaptive modes of concrete expe-
rience and abstract conceptualization and the modes of active experimentation and 
reflective observation are characteristically resolved in different fields of inquiry (com-
pare Chapter 5). This approach draws on the work of Stephen Pepper (1942, 1966), 
who proposes a system for describing the different viable forms of social knowledge. 
This system is based on what Pepper calls world hypotheses. World hypotheses corre-
spond to metaphysical systems that define assumptions and rules for the development 
of refined knowledge from common sense. Pepper maintains that all knowledge systems 
are refinements of common sense based on different assumptions about the nature of 
knowledge and truth. In this  process of refinement he sees a basic dilemma. Although 
common sense is always applicable as a means of explaining an experience, it tends to be 
imprecise. Refined knowledge, on the other hand, is precise but limited in its application 
or generalizability because it is based on assumptions or world hypotheses. Thus, com-
mon sense requires the criticism of refined knowledge, and refined knowledge requires 
the security of common sense, suggesting that all social knowledge requires an attitude 
of partial skepticism in its interpretation.
Summary: A Definition of Learning
Even though definitions have a way of making things seem more certain than they are, it 
may be useful to summarize this chapter on the characteristics of the experiential learn-
ing process by offering a working definition of learning.3 Learning is the process whereby 
knowledge is created through the transformation of experience. This definition emphasizes 
several critical aspects of the learning process as viewed from the experiential perspec-
tive. First is the emphasis on the process of adaptation and learning as opposed to content 
3.  From this point on, I will drop the modifier “experiential” in referring to the learning process described 
in this chapter. When other theories of learning are discussed, they will be identified as such.

Experiential Learning
or outcomes. Second is that knowledge is a transformation process, being continuously 
created and recreated, not an independent entity to be acquired or transmitted. Third, 
learning transforms experience in both its objective and subjective forms. Finally, to 
understand learning, we must understand the nature of knowledge, and vice versa.
Update and Reflections
The Learning Cycle and the Learning Spiral
The people who ‘learn by experience’ often make great messes of their 
lives, that is, if they apply what they have learned from a past incident 
to the present, deciding from certain appearances that the circumstances 
are the same, forgetting that no two situations can ever be the same. . . . 
All that I am, all that life has made me, every past experience that I have 
had—woven into the tissue of my life—I must give to the new experience. 
That past experience has indeed not been useless, but its use is not in 
guiding present conduct by past situations. We must put everything we 
can into each fresh experience, but we shall not get the same things out 
which we put in if it is a fruitful experience, if it is part of our progressing 
life . . . We integrate our experience, and then the richer human being 
that we are goes into the new experience; again we give ourself and 
always by giving rise above the old self.
—Mary Parker Follett, 1924, pp. 136–137
Chapter 2 defines the experiential learning cycle particularly as represented in the theories 
of Lewin and Dewey. It further suggests that Piaget’s more linear model of development is 
consistent with the learning cycle adding his two dialectical dimensions of concrete phe-
nomenalism/abstract constructionism and active ego-centrism/internalized reflection. 
The learning cycle and the concept of learning style are the most widely known and used 
concepts in experiential learning theory; although there is considerable confusion and mis-
understanding of the concepts often resulting from being taken out of the context of the 
wider experiential learning theory framework. This update will address these issues with 
regard to the learning cycle (the Chapter 4 update will do so for the concept of learning style).
Understanding the Learning Cycle
In its most current statement (Kolb and Kolb, 2013) experiential learning theory is 
described as a dynamic view of learning based on a learning cycle driven by the resolution 
51
Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
of the dual dialectics of action/reflection and experience/abstraction. Learning is defined 
as “the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience” 
(Chapter 2, p. 49). Knowledge results from the combination of grasping and transform-
ing experience. Grasping experience refers to the process of taking in information, and 
transforming experience is how individuals interpret and act on that information. The 
experiential learning theory learning model portrays two dialectically related modes of 
grasping experience—Concrete Experience (CE) and Abstract Conceptualization (AC)—
and two dialectically related modes of transforming experience—Reflective Observation 
(RO) and Active Experimentation (AE). Learning arises from the resolution of creative 
tension among these four learning modes. This process is portrayed as an idealized learn-
ing cycle or spiral where the learner “touches all the bases”—experiencing (CE), reflecting 
(RO), thinking (AC), and acting (AE)—in a recursive process that is sensitive to the learn-
ing situation and what is being learned. Immediate or concrete experiences are the basis 
for observations and reflections. These reflections are assimilated and distilled into abstract 
concepts from which new implications for action can be drawn. These implications can be 
actively tested and serve as guides in creating new experiences (see Figure 2.5).

The Experiential Learning Cycle

Experiential Learning
This cycle of learning has been widely used and adapted in the design and conduct of 
countless educational programs. A Google image search of “learning cycle” produces a 
seemingly endless array of reproductions and variations of the cycle from around the 
world.
While I have been personally gratified by the scholarship and pragmatic utility gener-
ated by the concept, others have been alarmed and concerned by its apparent simplicity 
and failure to “problematize” experience. Reijo Miettinen asks, “Why is this conception 
so popular within adult education? . . . Perhaps the idea of experiential learning forms 
an attractive package for adult educators. It combines spontaneity, feeling, and deep 
individual insights with the possibility of rational thought and reflection. It maintains 
the humanistic belief in every individual’s capacity to grow and learn, so important for 
the concept of lifelong learning. It comprises a positive ideology that is evidently impor-
tant for adult education. However, I fear that the price of this package for adult educa-
tion and research is high . . . the belief in an individual’s capabilities and his individual 
experience leads us away from the analysis of cultural and social conditions of learning 
that are essential to any serious enterprise of fostering change and learning in real life.” 
(2000, pp. 70–71). In an editorial in the Adult Education Quarterly, the editors echo 
this concern about the “unquestioned notion of experience in the pragmatic tradition”: 
“Kolb’s learning cycle has become as ubiquitous as Maslow’s hierarchical triangle. This 
is not just unfortunate, but limiting, because it restricts the way we see and understand 
experience which thus limits the way we can learn in-from-to experience” (Wilson and 
Hayes, 2002, p. 174).
In a way I also, on occasion, have been disturbed by oversimplified interpretations and 
applications of the learning cycle. Many times this seems to be because the cycle has been 
taken out of the wider context of experiential learning theory, and/or I have failed to 
explain my perspective adequately. The Adult Education Quarterly editors should not be 
worried, for among the thousands of scholarly articles published about experiential learn-
ing theory, I have found over 50 that have examined and critiqued experiential learning 
theory from their perspective as well as others. The views expressed represent a wide range 
of opinion and theoretical orientations, sometimes contradicting each other. Collectively 
they open a valuable conversation about the future of experiential learning research and 
practice. Experiential Learning was not the first word on the subject (as we have seen in 
Chapter 1 and its update), and it certainly was not intended to be the last. With the help 
of the thoughtful critiques I will address some of these views from my perspective today. 
The learning cycle describes an individual model of learning that ignores the histori-
cal, cultural, and social context of learning. Some critics (Hopkins, 1993; Seaman, 2008; 
Reynolds, 1997, 1998; Michelson, 1997, 1998, 1999; Fenwick, 2000, 2003) along with 
Miettinen and the journal editors have found the learning cycle and experiential learning 
theory in general to be too psychological and individualistic. Reynolds, for example, says 
experiential learning theory “is highly individualizing, and its psychological perspec-
53
Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
tive, whether orthodox or humanist, ignores or downgrades the social context . . . being 
psychological in conception it takes little or no account of the meaning of difference in 
terms of social or political process” (1997, p. 128).
Michelson poses her critique from a broader historical perspective suggesting:
“that mainstream theories of experiential learning . . . rest on an interiorized 
subjectivity that emerged only with the Enlightenment, when inner conscious-
ness came to be seen as a ‘space’ to be explored, a realm separate from and 
discontinuous with any external reality . . . (and) reproduce the Enlightenment 
relationship between psychic and cognitive interiority and political and eco-
nomic agency. Just as in the writings of Locke, the autonomy of privatized inner 
experience is what grounds our rights and liberties under the social contract: 
according to David Kolb, the fact that we are ‘still learning from our experi-
ence’ means that ‘we are free’ and able to ‘chart the course of our own destiny’ 
(Kolb, 1984, p. 109). Indeed, the conjoining of privatized experience with the 
claims to political agency is made explicit in the quotation by John Dewey with 
which Kolb (1984, p. 1) begins Experiential Learning: ‘The modern discovery 
of inner experience, of a realm of purely personal events that are always at the 
individual’s command and that are his [sic] exclusively . . . is also a great and 
liberating discovery. It implies a new worth and sense of dignity in human indi-
viduality’ ” (1999, p. 144). 
Agreeing with Dewey, my aim for experiential learning theory was to create a model for 
explaining how individuals learn and to empower learners to trust their own experience 
and gain mastery over their own learning. My psychological training as a personality 
theorist has made me a great advocate of individuality. Each of us is deeply unique, and 
we have an imperative to embrace and express that uniqueness, for the good of ourselves 
and for the world. Martha Graham said it well, “There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, 
a quickening, that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of 
you in all time, this expression is unique, and if you block it, it will never exist through 
any other medium and will be lost.” Individuality is different than individualism, which 
is egocentric. In individualism, “the individual is not viewed as an integral part of his or 
her social world; the feeling of belonging to a group is not seen as giving life purpose and 
direction. Rather society is viewed as either corrupting or civilizing our basically asocial 
nature” (Guisinger and Blatt, 1994, p. 105). 
Individuality and relatedness in experiential learning theory are poles of a fundamental 
dialectic of development, “. . . the capacities to form a mutual relationship with another, 
to participate in society, and to be dedicated to one’s own self-interest and expression 
emerge out of the integration and consolidation of individuality and relatedness in the 
development of a self-identity . . .” (Guisinger and Blatt, 1994, pp. 108–109). Similarly, 
Susanne Cook-Greuter (1999) and David Bakan (1966) argue that there is a human need 
54 
Experiential Learning
to fulfill the double goals of autonomy (differentiation, independence, mastery) and 
homonomy (integration, participation, belonging).
It is true that Experiential Learning is not a discourse on social and political factors that 
influence what people learn and believe in the tradition of critical theory. This was not 
my purpose, though I believe that experiential learning theory is not incompatible with 
these approaches. Both views together enhance our full understanding of experiential 
learning. Among the experiential learning theory foundational scholars, Dewey and 
Follett were leaders in the Progressive movement, and Freire’s life was one of struggle 
for social justice in his country. Vygotsky’s work is foundational for activity theory and 
social constructivism. From their contributions, experiential learning theory has much 
to offer critical cultural theory in pedagogy, feminist theory, post-structural scholarship, 
social constructionism, post-colonial, and indigenous culture studies.
The learning cycle is constructivist and cognitivist. These terms have been used to 
characterize the learning cycle as portraying learning in a way that separates the indi-
vidual from the environment. Fenwick defines constructivism as a process where “the 
learner reflects on lived experience and then interprets and generalizes this experi-
ence to form mental structures. These structures are knowledge, stored in memory as 
concepts that can be represented, expressed, and transferred to new situations (2000, 
p. 248). . . . In the constructivist view, the learner is still viewed as fundamentally 
autonomous from his or her surroundings. The learner moves through context, is in it 
and affected by it, but the learner’s meanings still exist in the learner’s head and move 
with the learner from one context to the next. Knowledge is thus a substance, a third 
thing created from the learner’s interaction with other actors and objects and bounded 
in the learner’s head. Social relations of power exercised through language or cultural 
practices are not theorized as part of knowledge construction” (2000, p. 250).
Michelson seems to ignore the holistic characteristic of experiential learning theory 
(Chapter 2, pp. 43–45) when she argues that the constructivism of the learning cycle por-
trays learning as occuring in the mind alone, “. . . the mind accesses information about 
the world and uses that information to produce learning. The body functions essentially 
as sensate medium and testing instrument, while the emotions and the spirit do not 
participate at all” (1997, p. 48). 
Constructivism, of course, originated in the work of Piaget and Vygotsky whose ideas 
play a big role in experiential learning theory. However, I modified the constructivist 
view in significant ways (see Chapter 3, p. 66; Chapter 6, pp. 201–205). Holman, Pav-
lica, and Thorpe use the somewhat pejorative term “cognitivist” preferred by critical 
theorists and social constructionists to at first acknowledge these modifications and 
then discount them, “KELT is rarely linked to, and often considered fundamentally dif-
ferent from cognitive learning schools. Indeed Kolb himself has sought to distance his 
theory from a strict Paigetiatian cognitivism by stressing its roots in pragmaticism and 
55
Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
social action theories. . . . However, while KELT may have its roots in Dewey and Lewin, 
Kolb’s reworking of these and other theorists upon whom he draws embeds his work 
in a number of cognitivist assumptions which relate to the nature of self and thought 
. . . to produce a work that is fundametally cognitivist” (1997, p. 136). The “cognitivist 
assumptions” they cite include the person is independent of the social/historical/cultural 
context, representational thinking and mental process can be studied in isolation.
What I think the critics from this perspective have missed in their reading of Experi-
ential Learning is the posited transactional relationship of the individual and the social 
environment. The Gestalt foundational scholars, Kurt Lewin and Mary Parker Fol-
lett, William James (radical empiricism), and John Dewey (depiction of the difference 
between interaction and transaction), all portray an embedded and integrated view 
of the individual and the world that stands in contrast to Piaget’s description of an 
individual developmental process that is universal across contexts (see Chapter 6, pp. 
201–205). In the section describing learning as a transaction between the person and 
environment in Chapter 2 (pp. 45–48), I summarize the issue: “The word transaction is 
more appropriate than interaction to describe the relationship between the person and 
the environment in experiential learning theory because the connotation of interac-
tion is somehow too mechanical, involving unchanging separate identities that become 
intertwined but retain their separate identities . . . The concept of transaction implies 
a more fluid interpenetrating relationship between objective conditions and subjective 
experience, such that once they become related, both are essentially changed.” (See “The 
Learning Spiral” section below.) Mary Parker Follett describes this process which she 
calls “circular response” in human relationships: “Through circular response we are 
creating each other all the time . . . Accurately speaking the matter cannot be expressed 
by the phrase used above, I-plus-you meeting you-plus-me. It is I plus the-interweaving-
between-you-and-me meeting you plus the-interweaving-between-you-and-me, etc., 
etc. ‘I’ can never influence ‘you’ because you have already influenced me; that is, in the 
very process of meeting, by the very process of meeting, we both become something 
different” (1924, pp. 62–63).
The Experiential Learning Cycle is an oversimplified view of learning describing a 
mechanical step-by-step process that distorts both learning and experience. Seaman, 
who calls for an end to the “Learning Cycles Era,” suggests that “the definition of expe-
riential learning as an orderly series of steps is either false . . . or represents only a nar-
row type of experiential learning. . . . The intent of this article is not to suggest that the 
routine patterns used in different experiential practices . . . should be abandoned. This 
approach has unquestionably served many practitioners throughout the years. Rather, 
this article has argued against the claim that experiential learning can be fundamentally 
understood as equivalent to these patterns” (2008, p. 15). Others have also viewed the 
distinct sequential stages of the learning cycle as an oversimplified description of learn-
ing (DiCiantis and Kirton, 1996; Holman, 1997; Smith, 2010; Jarvis, 1987, 1995).
56 
Experiential Learning
As I described in the introduction, I, too, initially used the learning cycle in a simplistic 
way as a pragmatic tool to organize learning events. It was only after I saw the resulting 
rich experience and learning that was created for learners that I began to search for a 
theoretical explanation of the learning process in the work of the experiential learning 
theory foundational scholars. The concept of learning style was created later, based 
on the emerging theory of experiential learning. Our observations of different styles 
of learning were in fact different ways of engaging the learning cycle (Kolb and Kolb, 
2013a). The insight that led me to think that the cycle of learning from experience was 
more complex was the identification of the two dialectically related dimensions of grasp-
ing experience via concrete experience and abstract conceptualization and transform-
ing experience via active experimentation and reflective observation. I first noticed the 
dimensions in the theories of Lewin, Dewey, Piaget, and Freire and developed them 
further with the aid of Jung’s introversion/extraversion transformation dialectic and 
with James’ apprehension/comprehension grasping dialectic. (For my explanations of 
these dialectic dimensions and their relationship to the learning process, see Chapter 2, 
pp. 40–42; Chapter 3, pp. 65–86; Chapter 5, pp. 159–163; Chapter 6, pp. 199, 210–215; 
and Chapter 8, pp. 328–333.)
Introduction of the dialectic dimensions confuses structure and process. However, 
for Hopkins, an avid phenomenologist, the introduction of the dialectic structural 
analysis to the stage model doesn’t work: “Kolb’s theory as a formalistic reification of 
experiential process cannot withstand phenomenological reflection . . .” (1993, p. 54) 
He argues with Nelson and Grinder (1985) that my combination of structure and pro-
cess doesn’t work because it fails to “untangle” the relation between the two. Miettinen 
agrees that the stage model is not helped by the introduction of the dialectic dimensions: 
“The phases remain separate. . . . Kolb does not present any concept that would connect 
the phases to each other. . . . Kolb continuously speaks about ‘dialectic tension’ between 
experiential and conceptual. However, he resolves the tension simply by taking both as 
a separate phase to his model. There is surely no dialectics in this. Dialectic logic would 
show how these two are indispensable related to each other and are determined through 
other” (2000, p. 61). 
For me, these dialectic opposites opened a space for experiencing that embraced the mul-
tidimensional aspects of experience and all modes of the learning cycle as described in 
James’ radical empiricism and in phenomenology (Introduction, pp. xxii–xxiii). Experi-
encing, reflecting, thinking, and acting are not separate independent entities but inextri-
cably related to one another in their dialectic opposition. They are mutually determined 
and in dynamic flux. The dialectic dimensions also formed the basis of the concept of 
learning style; a habit of learning that is formed when one or more of the learning modes 
is preferred over others to shape experience, resulting in a constriction and limiting of the 
experiencing space around the mode(s). The ranking format of the Learning Style Inven-
tory was chosen precisely to describe the interdependent holistic relationship among the 
57
Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
modes (generating considerable controversy about the resulting ipsativity of the data, to 
be discussed later in the Chapter 4 update). Miettinen has it backwards when he says, 
“The separateness of the phases and corresponding modes of learning are also based on 
the fact that the model is constructed to substantiate the validity of the learning style 
inventory. The construction of distinct styles makes it necessary to postulate distinct 
modes of adaptation. In this way the technological starting point partly dictates the mode 
and content of the ‘theoretical’ model” (2000, p. 61). 
The conflicts between opposing dialectics help explain the dynamic nature of experience 
(Bassechess, 1984, 2005): as in Piaget’s ongoing to-and-fro between assimilating experi-
ences into existing concepts and accommodation of concepts to new experiences, or in 
Dewey’s recursive uniting of desire and idea to form purpose. There may be pragmatic 
utility in organizing education around an idealized cycle that begins with concrete expe-
rience, is followed by reflection alone or with others, introducing concepts and theory to 
organize and conclude the meaning of the experience, and then concludes with action to 
test the conclusions in new experience. However, as learners, our experiences are seldom 
so orderly. In one moment we may be lost in thought only to be jolted to awareness of 
a dramatic event, sparking immediate action or cautious observation depending on our 
habit of learning. Our learning style may dictate where we begin a process of learning 
and/or the context may shape it. Learning usually does not happen in one big cycle but 
in numerous small cycles or partial cycles. Thinking and reflection can continue for 
some time before acting and experiencing. Experiencing and reflecting can also continue 
through much iteration before concluding in action. 
The primary importance of reflection for learning and development is not 
 emphasized. A number of important experiential learning theorists such as David Boud 
(Boud, Keogh, and Walker, 1985; Boud and Miller, 1996), Jack Mezirow (1990, 1996), 
Stephen Brookfield (1987, 1995), and Donald Schon (1983) place reflection as the pri-
mary source of the transformation that leads to learning and development. Unlike these 
advocates of reflective practice, reflection in experiential learning theory is not the sole 
determinant of learning and development but is one facet of a holistic process of learning 
from experience that includes experiencing, reflecting, thinking, and acting. As we have 
seen, the shock of direct concrete experience may be necessary to initiate it. Reflection in 
isolation can become retroflection, a turning in on itself that isolates the learners in their 
own self-confirming world unable to reach conclusions or test them in action. When 
reflection is structured in a critical theory framework, Kegan (1994) and Kayes (2002) 
have argued that it can have dysfunctional effects. “Critical approaches may help indi-
viduals gain insight into their social context, but this often leaves the individual stranded 
in a complex world without the appropriate tools to reorder this complexity. The newly 
‘emancipated’ may experience more repression that ever as they become stripped of their 
own capacity to respond to new, more challenging demands that come with emancipa-
tion” (Kayes, 2002, p. 142).
58 
Experiential Learning
Mary Parker Follett (1924) stresses the intimate relationship between experience, action, 
and reflection. “We often hear people talk of the interpretation of experience as if we first 
had an experience and then interpreted it, but there is a closer and different connection 
between these two; my behavior in that experience is as much a part of my interpretation 
as my reflection upon it afterwards; my intellectual, post-facto, reflective interpretation 
is only part of the story.” Reflection also requires cognitive complexity and the capacity 
for critical thinking, the abstract conceptualization phase of the learning cycle. Deep 
reflection requires a rich and integrated cognitive structure to be able to adopt different 
perspectives and analytical strategies.
In experiential learning theory reflection is defined as the internal transformation of 
experience. This broad definition includes several more specific reflective processes that 
vary by learning style and developmental level. The three reflective learning styles in the 
KLSI 4.0 (Kolb and Kolb, 2011, 2013) define a continuum of reflection. The Imagining 
style is focused on iconic transformation of images that are still somewhat immersed 
in the concrete experiences of sensation and affect. At the other extreme is the Analyz-
ing style, where reflection is more systematic manipulation of abstract symbols fully 
independent of experience and context. In between, the Reflecting style explores deeper 
meanings to integrate image and symbol. 
The three stages of development in the experiential learning theory developmental frame 
work—acquisition, specialization, and integration each are characterized by different 
reflective processes. These processes have been articulated most clearly by Humphrey 
(2009) as reflection, reframing and reform.
 
■ Reflection. Reflection at this elementary level constitutes spontaneous reflective 
observation of direct experiences. In Zull’s depiction of experiential learning and 
the brain, direct sensory experiences are connected to memories, images and 
emotions in the temporal integrative cortex.
 
■ Reframing. Dewey distinguished what he called casual spontaneous reflection at 
the first level from a more intense reflective process he called critical reflection 
(1933, p. 14). Critical reflection entails an examination and critique of reflective 
observations from specialized theories and analytic frameworks. The framework 
is used to examine assumption and reframe issues, adopting alternative perspec-
tives that produce a deeper understanding. Critical reflection is often associated 
with critical theory (Brookfield, 1995, 2009) and post-structural deconstruc-
tion (Fook, 2002), frameworks for unmasking power manipulations and hid-
den forms of social control. However, other disciplined systems of inquiry, for 
example, aesthetics (Dewey, 1934; Rasanen, 1997), can also offer possibilities for 
reframing that produce creative new perspectives. 
 
■ Reform. Reflection at the integrative level, often referred to by Freire and others 
as praxis, integrates critical reflection with the full learning cycle producing a 
59
Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
process whereby action is reformed by reflection and reflection is reformed and 
informed by action and its consequences in experience.
Is “Pure experience” impossible or necessary for learning? Another critique of the 
learning cycle is that there is no such thing as concrete experience independent from 
abstract theories and symbols (e.g., Holman, 1997; Miettinen, 2000; Seaman, 2008; 
Michelson, 1996; Fenwick, 2000, 2003). Indeed, it is axiomatic among contemporary 
cognitive theorists that all perception is influenced by cognitive schema. It is also true 
that the dialectic dimension of Concrete Experience/Abstract Conceptualization recog-
nizes that experience and concept are usually related. James himself saw pure experience 
as the extreme pole of the dialectic, saying, “only new-born babes, or men in semi-coma 
from sleep, drugs, illnesses, or blows may be assumed to have an experience pure in the 
literal sense of a that which is not yet any definite what. . . . Its purity is only a relative 
term, meaning the proportional amount of un-verbalized sensation which it still embod-
ies” (1912, 2010, p. 94). 
Taylor and Wozniak in Pure Experience suggest that the idea of pure experience is for-
eign to Western thought: “The fact was, nothing in their history had prepared Western 
philosophers and psychologists for radical empiricism. As the reactions to his writings 
showed, it is exceptionally difficult to suspend our logical categories and see the imme-
diate moment shorn of our labels of it. . . . Yet we have in James radical empiricism a 
position that goes right to the heart of the Western viewpoint, exposing its limits (Taylor 
and Wozniak, 1996, p. xxxi).
James’ radical empiricism helps us to understand that all modes of the learning cycle 
are experiences—“If we take conceptual manifolds, or memories, or fancies, they also 
are in their first intention mere bits of pure experience” (1904, p. 483). “Pure” Concrete 
Experience is but one special form of experience—moment-to-moment, here-and-now 
 consciousness: “the immediate flux of life which furnishes the material to our later reflec-
tion with its conceptual categories.” Dewey call this “immediate empiricism” and agreed 
with James, radical empiricism that, “It is in the concrete thing as experienced that all the 
grounds and clues to its own intellectual and logical rectification are contained” (1905, 
p. 397).
As we saw in the Introduction Dewey saw that much experience was conservative, habit-
ual “empirical experience” and required being “stuck” or a “shock” to provoke critical 
reflection and learning. In this he presaged contemporary research on automaticity, 
suggesting  that conscious acts of self-regulation are rare and as much as 95 percent of 
behavior occurs automatically without them (Baumeister et al., 1998; Baumeister and 
Sommer, 1997; Bargh, J. A., and Chartrand, 1999). This insight is of profound impor-
tance for experiential learning. While many theorists described above, along with Dewey, 
have stressed that critical reflection is of primary importance for learning from experi-
ence, we see here that a concrete “pure” experience that violates the expectations of 
60 
Experiential Learning
previous convictions and habits of thought is necessary to activate such reflection in 
the first place. This suggests that experience shorn of habit and cultural interpretation 
is necessary for learning anything new. Seaman goes further, “. . . evidence suggests 
that conscious reflection does not play a basic role in experiential learning as is widely 
believed: research in social practice” traditions show how people learn in experience not 
from or after it. . . . These findings . . . make the sentiment ‘experience alone is not the key 
to learning’ (Boud et al., 1985, p. 7) simply seem strange, if not misguided (2008, p. 11). 
While some learning probably occurs from empirical experience, it is probably the kind 
that reinforces previous conclusions or refines thought or behavior in small ways. For 
bigger changes such as overcoming addiction, we see that a “shock” that disrupts life is 
necessary.
There are, however, other ways beside “shock and awe” to strip a momentary concrete 
experience from its judgmental habitual biases. There are two deliberate learning prac-
tices for deep experiencing: focusing, derived from Carl Rogers’ client-centered therapy, 
and mindfulness, derived from Eastern concepts of metaphysics and psychology. 
Focusing
Rogers’ nondirective therapy method brings awareness and trust of one’s inner expe-
rience through the creation of a psychologically safe environment of unconditional 
positive regard. “As the client senses and realizes that he is prized as a person, he can 
slowly begin to value the different aspects of himself. Most importantly, he can begin 
with much difficulty at first, to sense and to feel what is going on within him, what 
he is feeling, what he is experiencing, how he is reacting. He uses his experiencing as 
a direct referent to which he can turn in forming accurate conceptualizations and as 
a guide to his behavior” (Rogers, 1964, p. 163). When Eugene Gendlin (1961, 1962) 
studied this kind of experiencing among clients of Rogerian and other forms of psycho-
therapy he discovered that assessments of a client’s experiencing ability in the first two 
therapy sessions predicted success or failure of the therapy. Experiencing ability was 
more important than anything the therapist did in predicting outcomes. Gendlin calls 
this “focusing,” an embodied way of experiencing that is beneath thought, language, 
and emotion. When this bodily sense comes to awareness, there is a physical change in 
the body, a felt shift that then can be analyzed and conceptualized. In Focusing (1978) 
he developed a six-step technique to help individuals learn how to engage in this kind 
of direct body experiencing.
Mindfulness
Taylor and Wozniak (1996) note that James’ radical empiricism, while foreign to 
Western thinking, was highly compatible with Eastern metaphysics and psychology; 
giving the example of the Theraveda Buddhist image of moment consciousness as a 
string of pearls. The great Japanese Zen philosopher Kitaro Nishida (1911, 1990), who 
61
Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
sought to integrate Eastern and Western thought, embraced James’ radical empiri-
cism, making pure experience the center of his life’s work. While for James pure 
experience was a philosophical concept rarely experienced fully, for Nishida it was 
an experience to be lived fully and cultivated as a path to realization of an authentic, 
integrated humanity: “To experience means to know facts just as they are; to know 
in accordance with fact by completely relinquishing one’s own fabrications. What we 
usually refer to as experience is adulterated with some sort of thought, so by pure I am 
referring to the state of experience just as it is, without the least addition of deliberative 
discrimination. The moment of seeing a color or hearing a sound, for example, is prior 
not only to the thought that the color or sound is the activity of an external object or 
that one is sensing it, but also to the judgment of what the color or sound might be. 
In this regard, pure experience is identical with direct experience. When one directly 
experiences one’s own state of consciousness, there is not yet a subject or an object, 
and knowing and its object are completely united. This is the most refined type of 
experience” (1990, p. 3).
The practice of mindfulness aims to overcome automaticity and to reach direct, pure 
experience through mindful awareness and attention. A number of Western approaches 
to mindfulness have been developed in recent years. According to Kabat-Zinn, who 
created a medical program called mindfulness-based stress reduction, present moment 
experience is clouded by judgment and evaluation stemming from our needs and biases. 
It is “severely edited” by the habitual and unexamined activity of thoughts and emo-
tions (2003, p. 148). We have lenses that we “slip unconsciously between observer and 
observed that filter and color, bend and shape our view” (1994, p. 54). Brown and Ryan 
(2003) quote William James who stated, “Compared to what we ought to be, we are only 
half awake.” They go on to say, “Mindfulness captures a quality of consciousness that is 
characterized by clarity and vividness of current experience and functioning that stands 
in contrast to the mindless less ‘awake’ states of habitual or automatic functioning that 
may be chronic for many individuals” (2003, p. 823). In their definition, the mindful 
state involves flexible but stable awareness and attention, clear awareness, nonconceptual 
and nondiscriminatory perception, an empirically-oriented stance towards reality, and 
present-oriented consciousness. 
The Learning Spiral
The learning cycle, of course, is not a circle but a spiral where, as T.S. Eliot reminds us, 
we return again to the experience and know it anew in a continuous recursive spiral of 
learning. It is this spiral of learning that embeds us in a co-evolution of mutually trans-
forming transactions between ourselves and the world around us. The process is similar 
to Giddens’ theory of structuration (1984, 1991), which describes a dialectic between 
social structure and human agency bringing a new emphasis on human agency to socio-
logical theory. Giddens describes The Constitution of Society as an extended reflection on 
62 
Experiential Learning
a quotation by Marx, “Men make history but not in circumstances of their own choos-
ing” (1984, p. xxi). We are shaped and transformed by the physical, social, and historical 
forces in the world and at the same time have the capacity through our learning and 
actions to transform the world in an ongoing spiral of learning. 
Learning and Life
The experiential learning spiral represents the highest culmination of a learning process 
that can be traced to the organization of life itself; one that even can be seen in nonliv-
ing physical systems. In his classic compilation of the ubiquitous presence of the spiral 
form in plants and animals of all kinds, Sir Theodore Cook (1914) argues that the spiral 
is a key to understanding the process of life and the living creations of the human mind. 
In his concluding chapter, he writes, “Throughout our investigations this idea of energy 
and growth under resistance seems consistently to be connected with the spiral, and we 
have found that idea recognized in the use of the spiral as a conventional decoration not 
only by the philosophers of ancient China but even by peoples as old as the Aurignacian 
civilization of 20,000 years ago. (408) . . . One of the chief beauties of the spiral as an 
imaginative conception is that it is always growing, yet never covering the same ground, 
so that it is not merely an explanation of the past, but is also a prophesy of the future; and 
while it defines and illuminates what has already happened, it is also leading constantly 
to new discoveries” (423). What a wonderful description of the learning process!
Humberto Maturana (1970) discovered the learning spiral in his search for the answer 
to his question “What is the organization of the living?” What is the pattern of organiza-
tion that characterizes all living systems and distinguishes them from nonliving physical 
systems? His answer was that the organization of the nervous system of all living things 
was basically circular, that living systems are “organized in a closed circular process that 
allows for evolutionary change in a way the circularity is maintained but not for the loss 
of the circularity itself.” So, a spiral. He called this process autopoiesis, which means “self-
making,” emphasizing the self-referential and self-organizing nature of the network of 
production processes that produce and transform one another in a continual process 
of self-making. The closure of the system creates boundaries that allow the system 
autonomy to shape its relationship with the world. Varela says, “Closure means that 
you actually shape what counts as information in the coupling you have with the world. 
Information is brought forth by the actual activity of the organism or a cognitive system 
embedded in the world” (Davis, 1995, pp. 28–29). 
With his colleague Francisco Varela, Maturana proceeded to develop the systems theory 
of cognition arguing that cognition, the process of knowing, was identical with autopoi-
esis, the process of life (Maturana and Varela, 1980, 1987). Their definition of cognition, 
however, was more akin to the holistic concept of experiential learning than the popular 
definition of cognition as thinking. “The new concept of cognition, the process of know-
ing, is thus much broader than the concept of thinking. It involves perception, emo-
63
Chapter 2 The Process of Experiential Learning
tion, and action—the entire process of life. In the human realm cognition also includes 
language, conceptual thinking and all the other attributes of human consciousness. The 
general concept, however, does not necessarily involve thinking” (Capra, 1996, p. 175). 
In fact, Maturana and Varela argue that this new cognition is present in all living organ-
isms, even those without brains or nervous systems.
Ryan and Deci further suggest that autopoiesis is the foundation of the autonomous self: 
“Thus, we attempt to place the idea of self back into biological perspective by acknowl-
edging the continuity of our active phenomenal core with the coordinated and active 
nature of other entities with who we share the condition of life. We suggest that the phe-
nomenal self has its roots in the very process from which organization unfolds. Although 
most animals lack awareness of individuality as such, they manifest an active organiza-
tion of behavior. It is this organizational tendency that in evolutionary perspective rep-
resents the deep structure on which the sense of self and autonomy in humans is built” 
(2004, p. 471).
The way in which the autopoietic cognition is a learning process is further elaborated in 
the concept of structural coupling. Structural coupling defines the way a system inter-
acts with its environment, recurrently renewing and recreating itself. The environment 
does not specify or direct structural changes in the organism because the system is self-
referential and self-maintaining, but it triggers them. 
These structural changes produce changes in the future 
behavior of the system and its environment. Structural 
coupling describes the continuing path of the organ-
ism’s structural changes over time and thus describes 
the course of the organism’s learning and development. 
Figure 2.6 illustrates this autopoietic process in the 
life spiral of a shell. The spiral records the life history 
of the shell’s path of growth around its self-referential 
spine. I have been inspired by these lowly mollusks and 
the beautiful result of their life and learning they leave 
behind. 
The order-creating and self-maintaining characteristics 
of life can also be seen in nonliving physical systems. 
The Belgian physicist and chemist Ira Prigogene won the 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of dissipative 
structures in physical systems. Dissipative structures 
arise in physical systems that are far from equilibrium 
introducing unique higher order structures, creating “order out of chaos” to quote the 
title of his famous book. His research caused a revision in the then-prevailing view based 
on the second law of thermodynamics that the universe was “winding down” and moving 
toward an ever increasing entropy. Dissipative structures are created in this disorder and 
Figure 2.6

of a Shell

Experiential Learning
maintain and increase their order and complexity at the expense of the disorder around 
them just as living systems do. Prigogene believed that the discovery of these parallels 
between living and nonliving systems could help overcome the separation of man from 
nature that was fostered by Newtonian physics.
Recently Davis and Sumara (1997) and Fenwick (2000, 2003) have introduced these 
ideas in what Fenwick calls the “co-emergence/enactivist perspective” on experiential 
learning. She describes this approach as one that explores how cognition and environ-
ment become simultaneously enacted through experiential learning. Davis and Sumara 
offer the example of Gadamer’s concept of conversation (1965; Baker, Jensen, and Kolb, 
2002) that suggests conversations are not predetermined as in a monologue but arise in 
the process of conversing. “Given its unspecifiable path, Gadamer suggests that it is more 
appropriate to think of the participants as being led by the conversation than as leading it. 
The conversation is something more than the actions of autonomous agents—in a sense 
it has us; we do not have it.” Applied to education, they suggest that “the boundaries that 
currently define schools and universities be blurred so the relations between that which 
we call ‘teaching’ and that which we call ‘learning’ might be better understood as mutu-
ally specifying, co-emergent, pervasive and evolving practices that are at the core of our 
culture’s efforts at self-organization and self-renewal” (1997, p. 110).

Structural Foundations of the 
Learning Process
Our intellectual process consists . . . in a rhythm of direct 
 understanding—technically called apprehension—with indirect 
 mediated understanding technically called comprehension.
 —John Dewey, How We Think*
A term may be viewed in two ways, either as a class of objects . . . or as a 
set of attributes or characteristics which determine the objects. The first 
phase or aspect is called the denotation or extension of the term, while 
the second is called the connotation or intension. Thus the extension of 
the term “philosopher” is “Socrates,” “Plato,” “Thalus” and the like; its 
intension is “lover of wisdom,” “intelligent” and so on. . . . Why a term is 
applied to a set of objects is indicated by its intension; the set of objects to 
which it is applicable constitutes its extension.
— Morris Cohen and Ernest Nagel  
Introduction to Logic and  Scientific Method
T
he models of learning that were described in the last chapter provided tantaliz-
ing suggestions as to the nature of the learning process, but they also raise many 
important questions. How, for example, does one move through stages of the 
learning cycles described? Is this process identical for everyone? What determines how 
the dialectic conflicts between adaptive modes get resolved? With what consequences for 
learning and development? To answer these and other questions requires a more detailed 
examination and systematic formulation of the experiential learning process.

Experiential Learning
The approach taken in this chapter will be essentially structural. That is, the aim here 
is to identify the essential and enduring aspects of the learning process that determine 
its functioning, separating them from secondary, accidental aspects. In this sense, the 
structuralist approach seeks to draw the blueprints of how the “learning machine” func-
tions ideally, not to document its actual functioning under varying conditions of cir-
cumstance, mood, culture, and the like. To achieve an adequate structural analysis of 
the learning process, we need to determine (1) its holistic structure, defining the interde-
pendence of the internal components of the learning model without reliance on forces 
outside the model; (2) its transformation process, specifying the way in which structural 
components transact to maintain and elaborate themselves; and (3) its process of self-
regulation, describing how the structural system maintains its identity and integrity 
(compare Piaget, 1968, p. 5).
In a sense, this analysis is already under way, for we have seen in the last chapter how 
the more phenomenological, descriptive models of learning described by Lewin and 
Dewey are enriched and corroborated by Piaget’s structural dimensions of cognitive 
development—phenomenalism/constructivism and egocentricism/reflectivism. How-
ever, the model proposed in this chapter will deviate in some respects from Piaget’s 
formulation. For Piaget, these two dimensions represent a developmental continuum, 
in which phenomenalism and egocentricism are lower forms of knowing than are con-
structivism and reflection. I will propose here that the poles of these two dimensions are 
equipotent modes of knowing that through dialectic transformations result in learning. 
This learning proceeds along a third, developmental dimension that represents not the 
dominance of one learning mode over another but the integration of the four adaptive 
modes.1 We will have occasion to examine the details of the points of disagreement 
between my perspective and that of Piaget in the course of a more complete elaboration 
of the structure of experiential learning.
Process and Structure in Experiential Learning
As has been suggested, the process of experiential learning can be described as a four-
stage cycle involving four adaptive learning modes—concrete experience, reflective 
observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. In this model, con-
crete experience/abstract conceptualization and active experimentation/reflective obser-
vation are two distinct dimensions, each representing two dialectically opposed adaptive 
orientations. The structural bases of the learning process lie in the  transactions among 
these four adaptive modes and the way in which the adaptive dialectics get resolved. To 
1.  Those readers who are familiar with Piaget will already have noted this deviation from his linear idea 
of development in my description of the relationship between experiential learning and his model of 
development in Chapter 2. There I suggest an integrative developmental scheme by proposing that the 
stage of formal operations represents a return at a higher developmental level to the active orientation 
characteristic of stage 1.
67
Chapter 3 Structural Foundations of the Learning Process 
begin with, notice that the abstract/concrete dialectic is one of prehension, represent-
ing two different and opposed processes of grasping or taking hold of experience in 
the world—either through reliance on conceptual interpretation and symbolic repre-
sentation, a process I will call comprehension, or through reliance on the tangible, felt 
qualities of immediate experience, what I will call apprehension. The active/reflective 
dialectic, on the other hand, is one of transformation, representing two opposed ways 
of transforming that grasp or “figurative representation” of experience—either through 
internal reflection, a process I will call intention, or active external manipulation of the 
external world, here called extension. These two dimensions of learning—prehension 
and  transformation—correspond directly to Piaget’s figurative and operative aspects of 
thought:2
I shall begin by making a distinction between two aspects of thinking that are 
different, although complementary. One is the figurative aspect, and the other I 
call the operative aspect. The figurative aspect is an imitation of states taken as 
momentary and static. In the cognitive area the figurative functions are, above 
all, perception, imitation, and mental imagery, which is in fact interiorized 
 imitation.
The operative aspect of thought deals not with states but with transformations 
from one state to another. For instance, it includes actions themselves, which 
transform objects or states, and it also includes the intellectual operations, which 
are essentially systems of transformation. [Piaget, 1970, p. 14]
In the figurative aspects, perception and imitation correspond roughly to the apprehen-
sion process, and mental imagery corresponds to the comprehension process. For the 
operative aspect, there is a rough correspondence between action and the process of 
extension and between intellectual operations and the intention process.
With this brief overview of our structural perspective, we are now in a position to give 
more substance to the definition of learning proposed in the last chapter—namely, 
that learning is the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation 
of experience. Knowledge results from the combination of grasping experience and 
 transforming it (see Figure 3.1). And since there are two dialectically opposed forms 
of prehension and, similarly, two opposed ways of transforming that prehension, the 
result is four different elementary forms of knowledge. Experience grasped through 
 apprehension and  transformed through intention results in what will be called divergent 
2.  The concepts of prehension and transformation or figurative and operative aspects of thought have 
parallels in the computer modeling literature. For example, in Forrester’s system-dynamics approach to 
model building, he distinguishes between rates and levels, specifying that in any model, rates can only 
directly influence levels and vice versa (Forrester, 1971). A level (e.g., population size at any given time) 
corresponds to the prehension or figurative aspect, and a rate (e.g., percent increase in a given time 
period) corresponds to the transformation or operative aspect.
68 
Experiential Learning
knowledge. Experience grasped through comprehension and transformed through inten-
tion results in assimilative knowledge. When experience is grasped through comprehen-
sion and transformed through extension, the result is convergent knowledge. And finally, 
when experience is grasped by apprehension and transformed by extension, accommoda-
tive knowledge is the result. These elementary forms of knowledge, as will be shown in 
later chapters, become the building blocks for developmentally higher levels of knowing.
The central idea here is that learning, and therefore knowing, requires both a grasp or 
figurative representation of experience and some transformation of that representation. 
Either the figurative grasp or operative transformation alone is not sufficient. The simple 
perception of experience is not sufficient for learning; something must be done with it. 
Similarly, transformation alone cannot represent learning, for there must be something 
to be transformed, some state or experience that is being acted upon. This view is largely 
consistent with that of Piaget, although his work has tended to highlight the role of trans-
formation processes over the prehension process, whereas I will seek in this exposition 
to give both aspects equal status (compare Piaget, 1970, pp. 14–15).

Chapter 3 Structural Foundations of the Learning Process 
In what follows, we will examine evidence for the prehension and transformation dimen-
sions of learning from three different perspectives—philosophy, psychology, and physi-
ology. From these three fields there emerges a consistent picture of the structure and 
functioning of these two basic dimensions of the learning process.
The Prehension Dimension-Apprehension  
Versus Comprehension
That there are two distinct modes of grasping experience may not be readily apparent, 
but it is a fact that can be easily demonstrated with but a little effort. Pause in your read-
ing for a moment and become aware of your surroundings. What you see, hear, and 
feel around you are those sensations, colors, textures, and sounds that are so basic and 
reliable that we call them reality. The continuous feel of your chair as it firmly supports 
your body, the smooth texture of the book and its pages, the muted mixture of sounds 
surrounding you—all these things and many others you know instantaneously without 
need for rational inquiry or analytical confirmation. They are simply there, grasped 
through a mode of knowing here called apprehension. Yet to describe these perceptions 
faithfully in words, as I have attempted here, is somewhat difficult. It is almost as though 
the words are vessels dipped in the sea of sensations we experience as reality, vessels 
that hold and give form to those sensations contained, while sensations left behind fade 
from awareness. The concept “chair,” for example, probably describes where you are 
sitting (those of you in bed, standing in bookstore stalls, and so on notwithstanding). 
It is a convenient way to summarize a whole series of sensations you are having right 
now, although it tends to actively discourage attention to parts of that experience other 
than those associated with “chairness.” The concept also ignores particular aspects of 
your chair that may be important to you, such as hardness or squeakiness.
In this sense, concepts and the associated mode of knowing called comprehension seem 
secondary and somewhat arbitrary ways of knowing. Through comprehension we intro-
duce order into what would otherwise be a seamless, unpredictable flow of apprehended 
sensations, but at the price of shaping (distorting) and forever changing that flow. Yet 
knowing through comprehension has other qualities that have made it primary in human 
society—namely, that comprehensions of experience can be communicated and thereby 
transcend time and space. If you put down this book, get up from the chair, and leave 
the room, your apprehensions of that situation will vanish without trace (substituted for, 
of course, by new apprehensions of the hallway or whatever new immediate  situation 
you are in). Your comprehension of that situation, however, will allow you to create for 
yourself and communicate to others a model of that situation that could last forever. 
Further, to the extent that the model was accurately constructed from your apprehen-
sions, it allows you to predict and recreate those apprehensions. You can, for example, 
find again the comfortable chair you were sitting in, although if you did not attend to 
and comprehend the light source, you might not remember where the blue ceramic table 
70 
Experiential Learning
lamp is. For these tremendous powers of communication, prediction, and control that 
symbolic comprehension brings, the loss of the nuance and security of raw apprehended 
experience seems a small price to pay. Yet, as Goethe notes in Faust, it is a price—“Gray 
are all theories, / And green alone Life’s golden tree.”
The relation between apprehension and comprehension has been an enduring philosoph-
ical concern. The philosophical distinction between these forms of knowing is perhaps 
best described by William James, whose knowledge of acquaintance and  knowledge-about 
correspond to apprehension and comprehension respectively. The following quotation 
describes James’ view of these two kinds of knowledge:
There are two kinds of knowledge broadly and practically distinguishable: We 
may call them respectively knowledge of acquaintance and knowledge-about. 
Most languages express the distinction; thus, γνωˆναι ειδέναι; noscere, scire; ken-
nen, wissen; connâitre, savoir. I am acquainted with many people and things, 
which I know very little about, except their presence in the places where I have 
met them. I know the color blue when I see it, and the flavor of a pear when I 
taste it; I know an inch when I move my finger through it; a second of time, 
when I feel it pass; an effort of attention when I make it; a difference between two 
things when I notice it; but about the inner nature of these facts or what makes 
them what they are, I can say nothing at all. I cannot impart acquaintance with 
them to anyone who has not already made it himself. I cannot describe them, 
make a blind man guess what blue is like, define to a child a syllogism, or tell a 
philosopher in just what respect distance is just what it is, and differs from other 
forms of relation. At most, I can say to my friends, Go to certain places and act 
in certain ways, and these objects will probably come. All the elementary natures 
of the world, its highest genera, the simple qualities of matter and mind, together 
with the kinds of relation that subsist between them, must either not be known 
at all, or known in this dumb way of acquaintance without knowledge-about. In 
minds able to speak at all there is, it is true, some knowledge about everything. 
Things can at least be classed, and the times of their appearance told. But in 
general, the less we analyze a thing, and the fewer of its relations we perceive, the 
less we know about it and the more our familiarity with it is of the acquaintance-
type. . . . We can relapse at will into a mere condition of acquaintance with an 
object by scattering our attention and staring at it in a vacuous trance-like way. 
We can ascend to knowledge about it by rallying our wits and proceeding to 
notice and analyze and think. What we are only acquainted with is only present 
to our minds; we have it, or the idea of it. But when we know about it, we do 
more than merely have it; we seem, as we think over its relations, to subject it to 
a sort of treatment and to operate upon it with our thought. The words feeling 
and thought give voice to the antithesis. Through feelings we become acquainted 
with things, but only by our thoughts do we know about them. Feelings are the 
germ and starting point of cognition, thoughts the developed tree. . . . The men-
71

tal states usually distinguished as feelings are the emotions, and the sensations 
we get from skin, muscle, viscus, eye, ear, nose, and palate. The “thoughts,” as 
recognized in popular parlance, are the conceptions and judgments. [James, 1890, 
Vol. I, pp. 221–22]
Similar distinctions are made by Bertrand Russell (1912), Herbert Feigl (1958), and G.E. 
Moore, who describes two forms of actualized knowledge that parallel the apprehen-
sion and comprehension processes of grasping experience—apprehension (in direct and 
indirect forms) and knowledge proper (Klemke, 1969). Perkins distinguishes knowledge 
gained from physical concept formation and theory construction (comprehension) from 
what he calls “internal whatlike understanding” (apprehension), a process he defines 
as “that understanding of an experience that consists in knowing what an experience 
is like; and we know what an experience is like by virtue of having that experience” 
(1971, pp. 3–4). Whitehead distinguishes between two kinds of perception: perception 
by causal efficacy, in which one sees objects in terms of what can be done with them 
(comprehension), and perception by presentational immediacy, where one sees patches 
of color and hears patterns of sound (apprehension). Magrite seems to be expressing the 
dual knowledge idea in Les Idées Claires (see Figure 3.2). Similarly, Pepper (1966, p. 68) 
distinguishes between conceptual knowledge and felt qualities.
Pepper and Feigl use the distinction between these two forms of grasping experience to 
propose a solution to a perennial question of philosophy—the mind-body problem. Feigl 
suggests that there are dual languages referring to the two forms of knowing: phenom-
enal language, referring to felt qualities of experience (apprehension), and physical lan-
guage, referring to descriptive symbols (comprehension). Basing their ideas on research 
in neurophysiology, Pepper and Feigl maintained that the physical and phenomenal 
languages refer to the same thing—namely, the object of acquaintance directly referred 
to in phenomenal language. Feigl puts his mind-body identity thesis this way:
The identity thesis which I wish to clarify and defend asserts that the states of 
direct experience which conscious human beings “live through,” and those which 
we confidently ascribe to some of the higher animals, are identical with certain 
(presumably configurational) aspects of the neural processes in those organisms. 
To put the same idea in the terminology explained previously, we may say what is 
had-in-experience, and (in the case of human beings) knowable by acquaintance, 
is identical with the object of knowledge by description  provided first by molar 
behavior theory and this in turn is identical with what the science of neurophysiol-
ogy describes (or, rather, will describe when sufficient progress has been achieved) 
as processes of the central nervous system, perhaps especially in the cerebral cor-
tex. In its basic core this is a double knowledge theory. [Feigl, 1958, p. 446]
Since Feigl published that paragraph in 1958, research in neurophysiology has advanced 
greatly, providing enticing new evidence for the “double knowledge” theory. Recent 
72 
Experiential Learning
research on the specialized functions of the left and right hemispheres of the neocortex 
has the most relevance for the distinction between apprehension and comprehension 
as dialectically opposed modes for grasping reality. The origins of this work stem from 
the research and clinical observation of Roger Sperry and his colleagues in the early 
1960s (Sperry, Gazzaniga, and Bogen, 1969). They studied the behavior of so-called 
split-brain patients who, in order to relieve the frequency and severity of epileptic 
seizures, had undergone surgical division of the corpus callosum, a complex bundle 
of neural fibers connecting the left and right hemispheres of the neocortex. These 
patients as a result possessed two relatively normal hemispheres whose functions could 
be separately identified. The resulting studies produced results that are at odds with 
conventional and ancient wisdom about brain function. Until that time, it had been 
assumed that it was the left hemisphere that was responsible for all cognitive function-
ing worthy of the name—consciousness, verbal reasoning, analytic ability, and so on. 
The right hemisphere was thought to be something of a cerebral spare tire, a noncon-
scious automaton whose function was only to transmit information to the executive 
left hemisphere. Sperry showed that this was not the case. In fact, the right hemisphere 
was superior to the left in its functioning on some tasks, such as the visual construction 
required in drawing.
It is worth describing some of these split-brain studies to illustrate how dramatic the 
results were. Since the left hemisphere controls vision in the right visual field and the 
right hand, while the right hemisphere controls the left visual field and the left hand (see 
Figure 3.3), it was possible to do experiments that gave information on problems to only

one hemisphere or conflicting information to both hemispheres. Betty Edwards gives the 
following descriptions of the results of two such experiments:
A few examples of the specially designed tests devised for use with the split-brain 
patients might illustrate the separate reality perceived by each hemisphere and 
the special modes of processing employed. In one test two different pictures 
were flashed for an instant on a screen, with a split-brain patient’s eyes fixed on 
a midpoint so that scanning both images was prevented. Each hemisphere, then, 
received different pictures. A picture of a spoon on the left side of the screen 
went to the right brain; a picture of a knife on the right side of the screen went 
to the verbal left brain. When questioned, the patients gave different responses. 
If asked to name what had been flashed on the screen, the confidently articulate 
left hemisphere caused the patient to say, “knife.” Then the patient was asked to 
reach behind a curtain with his left hand (right hemisphere) and pick out what 
had been flashed on the screen. The patient then picked out a spoon from a 
group of objects that included a spoon and a knife. If the experimenter asked the 
patient to identify what he held in his hand behind the curtain, the patient might 
look confused for a moment and then say, “a knife.” The right hemisphere, 
knowing that the answer was wrong but not having sufficient words to correct 
the articulate left hemisphere, continued the dialogue by causing the patient 
to mutely shake his head. At that, the verbal left hemisphere wondered aloud, 
“Why am I shaking my head?”
In another test that demonstrated the right brain to be better at spatial problems, 
a male patient was given several wooden shapes to arrange to match a certain 
design. His attempts with his right hand (left hemisphere) failed again and again. 
His right hemisphere kept trying to help. The right hand would knock the left 
hand away; and finally, the man had to sit on his left hand to keep it away from 
the puzzle. When the scientists finally suggested that he use both hands, the 
spatially “smart” left hand had to shove the spatially “dumb” right hand away to 
keep it from interfering. [Edwards, 1979, pp. 30–31]
Further research with split-brain patients and later with normal subjects reinforced and 
elaborated the conclusion that the two hemispheres of the brain were specialized for two 
different modes of consciousness—the two different modes of knowing about the world 
that we are calling apprehension and comprehension.
Edwards (1979) has summarized the results of these studies in Figure 3.4. Left-mode 
functioning corresponds to the comprehension process. It is abstract, symbolic, 
analytical, and verbal. It functions in a linear sequential manner much like a digi-
tal computer. The right-mode function, corresponding to the apprehension process, 
is concrete, holistic, and spatial. Its functioning is analogic and synthetic, drawing 
together likenesses among things to recognize patterns. These different orientations to 
75
Chapter 3 Structural Foundations of the Learning Process 
prehension of the world are apparent in many human activities. In music, for instance, 
the left hemisphere governs the ability to read music, but it is the right hemisphere 
with its holistic pattern recognition sense that controls the ability to recognize, appre-
ciate, and remember melodies. The left hemisphere is specialized for understanding 
language communication, but it is the right hemisphere that is most adept at nonver-
bal understanding, such as recognizing facial expressions (Benton, 1980), emotion, 
and so on. It is not the assumed anatomical location of the functions identified by this 
research that is primary, for this is currently highly speculative, but their description 
Verbal:  Using words to name, describe, define.
Analytic:  Figuring things out step-by-step and 
part-by-part.
Symbolic:  Using a symbol to stand for 
something. For example, the drawn form   
         stands for eye, the sign + stands for
      the process of addition.
Abstract:  Taking out a small bit of information 
and using it to represent the whole thing.
Temporal:  Keeping track of time, sequencing 
one thing after another:  Doing first things 
first, second things second, etc.
Rational:  Drawing conclusions based on reason 
and facts.
Digital:  Using numbers as in counting.
Logical:  Drawing conclusions based on logic: 
one thing following another in logical 
order—for example, a mathematical theorem 
or a well-stated agrument.
Linear:  Thinking in terms of linked ideas, one 
thought directly following another, often 
leading to a convergent conclusion.
Nonverbal:  Awareness of things, but minimal 
connection with words.
Synthetic:  Putting things together to form 
wholes.
Concrete:  Relating to things as they are, at the 
present moment.
Analogic:  Seeing likenesses between things; 
understanding metaphoric relationships.
Nontemporal:  Without a sense of time.
Nonrational:  Not requiring a basis of reason or 
facts; willingness to suspend judgment.
Spatial:  Seeing where things are in relation to 
other things, and how parts go together to 
form a whole.
Intuitive:  Making leaps of insight, often based on 
incomplete patterns, hunches, feelings or 
visual images.
Holistic:  Seeing whole things all at once; 
perceiving the overall patterns and 
structures, often leading to divergent 
conclusions.

and recognition as representative of the dual-knowledge epistemology of experiential 
learning.
The hemisphere-dominance research provides compelling evidence for the theory that 
there are two distinct, coequal, and dialectically opposed ways of understanding the 
world. There is similar psychological evidence as well. In a recent American Psycholo-
gist article entitled, “Feeling and Thinking: Preferences Need No Inferences,” Robert 
Zajonc (1980) summarizes evidence from the early studies of Wilhelm Wundt to his own 
present-day research indicating that feeling and thinking are separate processes. He 
 further argues that affective responses are primary. Contrary to the accepted  psychological 
 doctrine that affective attributes are the result of cognitive analysis, Zajonc shows that in 
some cases, affective judgment occurs before cognitive analysis. These findings suggest 
a basis for that mysterious process we call intuition—namely, that intuitive behavior is 
guided by affective judgment (the apprehension process) rather than cognitive judg-
ment. For example, in one of his experimental studies, he showed that subjects were 
able to distinguish between old and new stimuli flashed for very short periods of time 
on the basis of affective judgment (like/dislike) before they were able to directly identify 
the stimuli as old and new. Zajonc suggests that cognitive judgments are based on dis-
criminando, the specific, analyzable, component features of a stimulus, whereas affective 
judgments are based on preferenda, which are more configural, vague, and global aspects 
of the stimulus.
. . . the separation being considered here is between an affective and a cognitive 
system—a separation that distinguishes between discriminanda and preferenda 
and that takes us back to Wundt and Bartlett, who speculated that the overall 
impression or attitude has an existence of its own, independent of the compo-
nents that contributed to its emergence. The question that cannot be answered 
with the data thus far collected is whether the affect-content  separation is  simply 
a matter of separate storage . . . or whether there isn’t some separation already 
at the point of registration and encoding. The rapid processing times of affect 
suggest a more complete separation of the two processes at several junctures.
One is necessarily reminded in this context of the dual coding hypothesis pro-
posed by Paivio (1975) for the processing of pictures and words. Paivio (1978a) 
suggested a number of differences between the processing of these types of 
content, for example, that representations of pictures emerge as perceptual iso-
morphs or analogs (imagens), whereas parallel units in the verbal system are 
linguistic components (logogens). He also proposed that pictorial information 
is organized in a synchronous and spatially parallel manner, whereas verbal 
information is discrete and sequential. Finally, he suggested that the process-
ing of pictures is more likely to be the business of the right-brain hemisphere, 
whereas the processing of words is the business of the left. [Zajonc, 1980, p. 168]

Chapter 3 Structural Foundations of the Learning Process 
The view that concrete apprehension processes are coequal with comprehension pro-
cesses represents a dramatic change from that of the 1940’s. Early research on brain 
damage viewed concreteness as a deficit, an indicator of brain damage (Goldstein and 
Scheerer, 1941). Piaget’s work represents an intermediate position, considering concrete 
apprehension processes to be a sign of the young brain and immature thought. Now the 
theory of dual prehension processes has gained great credibility, based particularly on 
the hemisphere specialization research. It has been the basis for sharp critiques of the 
domination of comprehensive left-mode thinking throughout our society, particularly in 
education (Bogen, 1975). The process of apprehension as a mode of grasping experience 
and understanding the world is gaining scientific respectability, confirming the long-
standing artistic recognition of these powers:
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains 
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend 
More than cool reason ever comprehends. 
The lunatic, the lover and the poet 
Are of imagination all compact. . . .

A Midsummer Night’s Dream3
The Transformation Dimension-Intention and Extension
Although they are logical terms, and have thus been applied primarily to the symbolic 
processes of comprehension, I have chosen the terms intention4 and extension to rep-
resent the basic transformation processes of learning as they apply to both the appre-
hensive and comprehensive modes of grasping experience. The dialectic nature of these 
dual transformation processes and their synergetic role in the creation of meaning has 
long been an accepted foundation of logical inquiry and the study of signs and symbols, 
the field of semiotics. The two major branches of semiotics—syntactics and semantics—
correspond respectively to the study of the intentional formal characteristics of symbols 
and the extensional denotation of signs and symbols—that is, the objects in the world 
that signs and symbols refer to. The computer scientist Douglas Hofstadter describes 
3.  Shakespeare seemed fascinated with the distinction between apprehension and comprehension as two 
ways of knowing. Use of these terms is sprinkled appropriately throughout his works, including the 
humorous misuse of the distinction when the constable in Much Ado About Nothing reports, “Our 
watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons.”
4.  The spelling is changed here from the logical term intension to include the broader psychological as 
well as logical meanings of intention (e.g., intent, purpose, meaning).
78 
Experiential Learning
the difference between these two processes and the central role that intention plays in 
thinking:
Not all descriptions of a person need be attached to some central symbol for 
that person, which stores the person’s name. Descriptions can be manufactured 
and manipulated in themselves. We can invent nonexistent people by making 
descriptions of them; we can merge two descriptions when we find they repre-
sent a single entity; we can split one description into two when we find it rep-
resents two things, not one—and so on. The “calculus of descriptions” is at the 
heart of thinking. It is said to be intensional and not extensional, which means 
that descriptions can “float” without being anchored down to specific, known 
objects. The intensionality of thought is connected to its flexibility, it gives us 
the ability to imagine hypothetical worlds, to amalgamate different descriptions 
or chop one description into separate pieces, and so on. . . . Fantasy and fact 
intermingle very closely in our minds, and this is because thinking involves the 
manufacture and manipulation of complex descriptions, which need in no way 
be tied down to real events or things. [Hofstadter, 1979, pp. 338–39]
What I propose here is that the transformation processes of intention and extension 
can be applied to our concrete apprehensions of the world as well as to our symbolic 
comprehensions. We learn the meaning of our concrete immediate experiences by 
internally reflecting on their presymbolic impact on our feelings, and/or by acting on 
our apprehended experience and thus extending it. Take, for example, the rose lying 
on my desk. I transform my apprehension of the rose intentionally by deploying my 
attention to its different aspects, noting the delicate pink color that is not solid but 
alternates subtly from white to a deeper rose. I sense its delicate fragrance and experi-
ence a blossoming of brief reminiscences. Here I cannot resist the impulse to transform 
the experience extensionally, to pick up the rose and hold it to my nose. In so doing, 
I prick my finger on the thorny stem and extend my apprehension of this rose still fur-
ther. Now this new extended apprehension further stimulates my internal reflections 
and feelings. . . .
Learning, the creation of knowledge and meaning, occurs through the active extension 
and grounding of ideas and experiences in the external world and through internal 
reflection about the attributes of these experiences and ideas. As Yeats put it, “The 
human soul is always moving outward into the external world and inward into itself, 
and this movement is double because the human soul would not be conscious were it 
not suspended between contraries. The greater the contrast, the more intense the con-
sciousness.”
As previously indicated, the conception that extension and intention are the basic 
transformation processes in learning is largely consistent with Piaget’s emphasis on 
the operative aspects of thought, which he divides into behavioral actions (extension) 
79
Chapter 3 Structural Foundations of the Learning Process 
that transform objects or states, and intellectual operations (intention) that are inter-
nalized actions or systems of transformation (see Piaget, 1971, p. 67). It should be 
noted that Piaget seems to associate extensional transformation (individual actions) 
primarily with concrete apprehensions of the world, whereas intentional transforma-
tion (reflective abstraction) is reserved for logical and mathematical knowledge. This 
is perhaps a function of his focus on child development, where we see as the child 
matures that reflection and abstraction together do replace overt action and concrete 
apprehension. In addition, Piaget’s tendency to view transformation by reflective 
abstraction as superior to overt action transformation also reflects this developmen-
tal focus. It will be argued here, however, that although the figurative and operative 
aspects develop together in childhood, in the mature adult the two dimensions are 
independent, producing four equipotent combinations of prehension and transforma-
tion (see Chapter 6, pp. 199–205).
In this sense, the transformation dimension is perhaps best described by the concepts of 
introversion (intention) and extraversion (extension), the primary concepts in the theory 
of types developed by Carl Jung:
. . . one could describe the introverted standpoint as one that under all circum-
stances sets the self and the subjective psychological process above the object and 
the objective process, or at any rate holds its ground against the object. This atti-
tude, therefore, gives the subject a higher value than the object. As a result, the 
object always possesses a lower value; it has secondary importance; occasionally 
it even represents merely an outward objective token of a subjective content, the 
embodiment of an idea in other words, in which, however, the idea is the essen-
tial factor; or it is the object of a feeling, where, however, the feeling experience 
is the chief thing, and not the object in its own individuality. The extroverted 
standpoint, on the contrary, sets the subject below the object, whereby the object 
receives the predominant value. The subject always has secondary importance; 
the subjective process appears at times merely as a disturbing or superfluous 
accessory to objective events. It is plain that the psychology resulting from these 
antagonistic standpoints must be distinguished as two totally different orienta-
tions. The one sees everything from the angle of his conception, the other from 
the viewpoint of the objective occurrence.
These opposite attitudes are merely opposite mechanisms—a diastolic going out 
and seizing of the object, and a systolic concentration and release of energy from 
the object seized. Every human being possesses both mechanisms as an expres-
sion of his natural life-rhythm. . . . [Jung, 1923, pp. 12–13]
In this original conception, Jung laid great emphasis on the epistimological aspects of 
introversion and extraversion. He saw in the distinction the psychological underpinning 
of the philosophical debate between nominalism, the view that universals and ideas exist 
80 
Experiential Learning
in name only, and realism, the doctrine that universals have a real objective existence. For 
Jung, truth lay neither in the nominalist or realist positions but in the dynamic integra-
tion of the introverted and extraverted attitudes:
Every logico-intellectual formulation, however embracing it may be, divests the 
objective impression of its living and immediate quality. It must do this in order 
to reach any formulation whatsoever. But, in so doing, just that is lost which to 
the extraverted attitude seems absolutely essential, namely, the relationship to 
the real object. No possibility exists, therefore, that we shall find upon the line 
of either attitude any satisfactory and reconciling formula. And yet man can-
not remain in this division—even if his mind could—for this discussion is not 
merely a matter of remote philosophy; it is the daily repeated problem of the 
relations of man to himself and to the world. And, because this at bottom is the 
problem at issue, the division cannot be resolved by a discussion of nominalist 
and realist arguments. For its solution a third, intermediate standpoint is needed. 
To the “esse in intellectu” tangible reality is lacking; to the “esse in re” the mind.
Idea and thing come together, however, in the psyche of man, which holds the 
balance between them. What would the idea amount to if the psyche did not 
provide its living value? What would the objective thing be worth if the psyche 
withheld from it the determining force of the sense impression? What indeed is 
reality if it is not a reality in ourselves, an “esse in anima?” Living reality is the 
exclusive product neither of the actual, objective behavior of things, nor of the 
formulated idea; rather does it come through the gathering up of both in the 
living psychological process, through the “esse in anima.” Only through the spe-
cific vital activity of the psyche does the sense-perception attain that intensity, 
and the idea that effective force, which are the two indispensable constituents of 
living reality. [Jung, 1923, p. 68]
In proposing esse in anima as the dialectic integration of esse in re and esse in intellectu, 
Jung was at great pains to assert the reality of the internal world of ideas and fantasy, 
placing it in an equal or perhaps even superior status with the demonstrable reality 
of the external world. He saw, in his time, that both the church and modern science 
had fostered attitudes that denied the reality of the inner world in favor of objective, 
publicly confirmable external events and objects. For the basic dialectic of introversion 
and extraversion to work, however, internal experience could not merely be reflections 
of the external world. The assertion of the validity and independent status of internal 
experiences in the face of the powerful social forces denying them was to become a 
central mission of Jung’s work, reflected in his later inquiries into mysticism, alchemy, 
and religion for the fundamental symbols or archetypes that constitute what he called 
the collective unconscious. Jung defined these archetypes as “active living dispositions, 
ideas in the Platonic sense, that preform and continually influence our thoughts, feelings, 
and actions” (Read et al. eds., 1961–1967, Vol. 8, p. 154). For Jung, the role of personal 
81
Chapter 3 Structural Foundations of the Learning Process 
experience was to actualize the potential that existed in the archetypes born within each 
and every living individual, inherited in the same way that physical characteristics are. 
By thus developing and playing our archetypes in personal life experiences, one achieved 
individuation or self-actualization by realizing one’s genetic potential. Personal develop-
ment was not the result of accumulated life experiences that shaped the personality (the 
Freudian/behaviorist view), but rather resulted from the interaction of internal subjec-
tive archetypical potentials and external circumstance.
I have included original excerpts from Jung here because as successive generations of 
researchers have explored introversion and extraversion, a kind of conceptual “genetic 
drift” has taken place, such that Jung’s original epistomological concerns and his con-
ception of the dialectic relationship between introversion and extraversion has been 
lost. Psychometricians have consistently conceived of introversion/extraversion (I/E) as 
a single dimension in spite of Jung’s clear conception of introversion and extraversion 
as independent entities in dialectic opposition (for example, Eaves and Eysenck, 1975). 
Most research studies have been unable to demonstrate a single I/E factor, and this 
has often been considered evidence for doubting the validity of the concept (Carrigan, 
1960) rather than as a failure to properly operationalize it. What these studies do show 
is that at least two independent factors are required to account for the intercorrela-
tions between I/E variables. One factor, emphasizing the strengths of introversion skills, 
seems to coincide with the common European view of the dimension, with its emphasis 
on impulsiveness and weak-superego controls in the extravert; the other, emphasizing 
the positive skills of the extravert, fits the American conception that views extraverts as 
sociable and comfortable in interpersonal relations. Although both these conceptions 
reflect meaningful aspects of introversion and extraversion, I prefer to think of them 
as secondary to the basic epistemological dynamics emphasized by Jung, at least for the 
present purposes of inquiry about learning.
Another facet of the psychological perspective on the processes of intention and exten-
sion is provided by a contemporary of Jung’s, Hermann Rorschach. The creator of the 
famous ink-blot projective test developed a measure of subjects’ responses to the test 
that he called experience balance. This measure is the ratio of responses to the test that 
are judged to be determined by the colors of the ink, divided into those responses that 
describe movement (for instance, two dancing women). Those persons labeled extra-
tensive by Rorschach, with a ratio favoring color, are said to be outwardly oriented, by 
virtue of their responsiveness to objective reality—color stimuli present in the blots. The 
perception of movement, on the other hand, has no corresponding external reality, and 
thus requires an intervening subjective process. Consequently, intratensive subjects, with 
a preponderance of movement responses, are described as having a more active “inner 
life” and less concern with external, objective reality.
Although Rorschach (1951) denied any relation between his experience balance concept 
and Jung’s extraversion-introversion, the two viewpoints seem to have much in  common 
82 
Experiential Learning
(compare Bash, 1955). Rorschach’s distinction between objective and subjective ori-
entation is the crux of Jung’s theory, and descriptions of the two Rorschach “experi-
ence types” are remarkably like Jung’s characterizations of the extravert and introvert. 
Moreover, evidence from several studies indicates that some of the empirical differences 
between extratensive and intratensive subjects correspond to hypothesized or observed 
differences between extraverts and introverts. Intratensives are more cognitively com-
plex than extratensives (Bieri and Messerley, 1957); they are more imaginative, have 
more active fantasy lives, and are more capable of motor inhibition (Singer, Wilensky, 
and McCraven, 1956); they have few doubts “that the self is a reasonably stable basis 
from which experience may be interpreted” (Palmer, 1956, p. 209; compare Mann, 1956; 
Singer and Spohn, 1954).
The contemporary work of Jerome Kagan adds further insights into the dynamics of 
intention and extension. His research on cognitive processes in children has identified a 
dimension that he calls impulsivity-reflection. This dimension, which he defines as “the 
degree to which the subject reflects on the validity of his solution hypothesis” (Kagan and 
Kogan, 1970, p. 1309), is very similar to the European view of introversion in its tendency 
to emphasize the positive skills of introversion, impulse control, and reflection. Kagan 
has used several tests to assess this dimension, the most common of which is the Match-
ing Familiar Figures Test. This test asks the child to select one figure from a group of six 
that is identical with a given standard. Impulsive children tend to make more errors and 
respond more quickly on this task than do reflective children. Kagan finds that reflec-
tion increases with age from 5 to 11 years; that people have fairly stable dispositions 
toward impulsivity or reflection over time—that is, they maintain their position on this 
dimension relative to their age mates; and that a given person’s tendency to be reflective 
or impulsive generalizes across different kinds of tasks. Kagan also finds, however, that 
people modify their orientations as a function of environmental demands; that is, when 
they are encouraged to take their time and be sure of answers, reflection increases (Kagan 
and Kogan, 1970). His interpretation of these and other findings suggests that impulsive 
and reflective people have different underlying motivational dynamics:
. . . the greater the fear of making a mistake, the more reflective and cautious 
the performance. Minimal anxiety over a potentially inaccurate answer is likely 
to be a primary determinant of an impulsive performance. Reflectives seem to 
be overly concerned with making a mistake and wish to avoid error at all costs. 
Impulsives seem minimally apprehensive about error and consequently respond 
quickly. It will be recalled that impulsive subjects did not scan all the alternatives 
before offering a solution hypothesis and reported words they did not hear in a 
serial recall procedures. [Kagan and Kogan, 1970, pp. 13–14]
Thus, those with an orientation toward extensional transformation are primarily con-
cerned with maximizing success, with little concern about failure or error. Being oriented 
83
Chapter 3 Structural Foundations of the Learning Process 
toward intentional transformation is associated with primary concern about avoiding 
failure and error and a willingness to sacrifice opportunities for successful performance 
in order to do so. The differences in these two definitions of successful performance are 
not only useful for understanding the behavior of children; they also shed light on basic 
conflicts between intentional and extensional orientations in the adult world. Many of 
the conflicts between science and government or between professionals and academics 
have their origin in these differences. The scientist, for example, seeks the best approxi-
mation of absolute truth and is socialized to avoid “irresponsible” errors, whereas the 
politician is perpetually faced with the imperative of action under uncertainty. Here, 
doing something takes priority over doing what is ideal.
As with the prehension modes of apprehension and comprehension, there is evidence, 
although more tentative, of physiological bases for the transformation modes of inten-
tion and extension. Whereas the control of prehension modes seems to reside primarily 
in the left and right hemispheres of the neocortex, Bogen (in press) has suggested that 
transformation processes may be reflected in a front-to-back placement in the brain: “If 
there is a manipulative (extension) vs. perceptual (intention) gradient in the brain, it 
is more likely from front to back than from left to right.” Other evidence suggests that 
orientations toward intention and extension are associated with changes in the limbic 
system, driven primarily by the arousal of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous 
systems. The sympathetic nervous system is considered to have a generally mobiliz-
ing function in preparation for action and coping with the external world, whereas the 
parasympathetic nervous system is thought to work toward the person’s protection, 
conservation, and relaxation when dealing with the external world is not required. These 
two portions of the limbic systems are somewhat independent but frequently are in com-
petition, so that a person’s extensional or intentional orientation would be a function of 
the joint momentary activity of the two systems.
The effect of the activation or inhibition of these two systems on performance and 
learning is illustrated by Broverman et al.’s (1968) review of the effects of drug-induced 
arousal or inhibition of these two systems. From their literature review of the effects of 
drugs on performance, they concluded that those substances that increased the organ-
ism’s level of activation (extensional orientation), either by stimulating the sympathetic 
nervous system or by depressing the functioning of the parasympathetic system, result 
in increased effectiveness in dealing with simple perceptual-motor tasks such as visual 
acuity or reading and writing speed, but result in poorer performance on more complex 
perceptual restructuring tasks that require inhibition of action and higher-order thought 
processes. Those substances that tended to increase the organism’s level of inhibition 
(intentional orientation) by depressing sympathetic nervous system functioning or by 
stimulating parasympathetic functioning produce the reverse pattern—poorer perfor-
mance on the simple tasks and improved performance on the complex tasks. This sym-
metrical but rather complex pattern of results is portrayed in Table 3.1.
84 
Experiential Learning
Overall, the evidence suggests that it is not the sympathetic/and/parasympathetic ner-
vous systems alone that determine the individual’s orientation toward intentional or 
extensional transformation of experience, but that these systems are major forces in 
determining a holistic pattern of psychological and physiological processes governing 
the person’s orientation toward action or reflection. Arthur Diekman has described these 
two orientations as an action mode and a receptive mode of consciousness. He describes 
the components of these two holistic orientations as follows:
The action mode is a state organized to manipulate the environment. The 
striate muscle system and the sympathetic nervous system are the dominant 
 physiological agencies. The EEG shows beta waves, and baseline muscle ten-
sion is increased. The principle psychological manifestations of this state are 
focal attention, object-based logic, heightened boundary perception, and the 
dominance of formal characteristics over the sensory; shapes and meanings 
have a preference over colors and textures. The action mode is a state of striving, 
oriented toward achieving personal goals that range from nutrition to defense 
to obtaining social rewards, plus a variety of symbolic and sensual pleasures, as 
well as the avoidance of a comparable variety of pain. . . .
In contrast, the receptive mode is a state organized around intake of the environ-
ment rather than manipulation. The sensory-perceptual system is the dominant 
agency rather than the muscle system, and parasympathetic functions tend to be 
most prominent. The EEG tends toward alpha waves, and baseline muscle ten-
sion is decreased. Other attributes of the receptive mode are diffuse attending, 
paralogical thought processes, decreased boundary perception, and the domi-
nance of the sensory over the formal. [Diekman, 1971, p. 481]

Chapter 3 Structural Foundations of the Learning Process 
With Jung, Diekman argues that the action mode has come to dominate the reflection 
mode in human society. The obvious survival value of orienting toward and coping 
with the external environment tends to overshadow the values of perception and expe-
riencing, in the receptive mode, an orientation that tends to be commonly associated 
with infancy, passivity, and regression. This domination is particularly prominent in 
Western technological societies, whereas Eastern cultures have tended to give more 
emphasis to the receptive mode and have developed reflective adaptive skills highly 
in such disciplines as yoga and Zen meditation. Certain forms of yoga can develop 
demonstrable voluntary control over parasympathetically controlled processes such 
as heartbeat and respiration rate. Currently, there is great interest in developing intro-
verted reflective functioning by using yogic meditative activities and other Eastern 
disciplines, such as the martial arts, as well as such Western technological variations 
as biofeedback, to cope with the stress and tension created by the overemphasis on the 
extraverted action mode and its attendant arousal of the sympathetic nervous system 
(for example, Ornstein, 1972).
Summary
This chapter has reported a convergence of evidence from the fields of philosophy, psy-
chology, and physiology describing two basic structural dimensions of the learning pro-
cess. The first is a prehension dimension that includes two dialectically opposed modes 
of grasping experience, one via direct apprehension of immediate concrete experience, 
the other through indirect comprehension of symbolic representations of experience. 
The second is a transformation dimension, which includes two dialectically opposed 
modes of transforming experience, one via intentional reflection, the other via exten-
sional action.
Previous thinking has tended to confuse the grasping and transformation dimensions by 
collapsing them into one dimension. Thus, Jung first saw extraversion as associated with 
the feeling orientation and introversion with the thinking orientation (Bash, 1955). Only 
later did his research separate these as independent dimensions. Similarly, Piaget sees 
the dimension of phenomenalism/constructivism and the operative dimension of ego-
centricism/reflection as correlated throughout the developmental process, although he 
does emphasize the differences between the figurative and operative aspects of thought 
in his structural analysis of cognitive development. Much of the literature on left/right 
brain functions has, in my own opinion, also confused the grasping dimension with 
the prehension dimension and as a result attributed to the left and right hemispheres 
psychological functions that are controlled elsewhere (see Ornstein, 1972; or Diekman, 
1971, quoted above). The position taken here is that it is useful to keep these dimensions 
analytically separate even though in some circumstances they are empirically correlated 
(such as in successive stages of child development).
86 
Experiential Learning
In addition, it is important to note that these two basic dimensions are not unitary 
continua; rather, each represents a dialectic opposition between two independent but 
mutually enhancing orientations. Apprehension and comprehension are each indepen-
dent modes of grasping experience. Physiological evidence suggests separate locations of 
these functions in the right and left cerebral hemispheres and an integrative mechanism 
in the corpus callosum.
Similarly, intention and extension are independent modes of transforming experience 
and appear to be controlled in part by the separate and interrelated parasympathetic 
and sympathetic nervous systems. Finally, it is maintained that apprehension and com-
prehension as prehension processes, and intention and extension as transformation 
processes, are equipotent contributions to the learning process. This is in disagreement 
with Piaget’s view that comprehension and intention are superior processes. This rela-
tionship between apprehension and comprehension and between intention and exten-
sion is captured (at an admittedly intuitive, apprehension level) by Escher’s etching, Day 
and Night (Figure 3.5).
After the description of the basic underlying structures of the experiential learning pro-
cess, it now remains for us to describe how these structures function in the learning 
process. In the next chapter, we will examine patterns and vicissitudes in the learning 
process and the concept of individual learning styles.

Update and Reflections
Experiential Learning and the Brain
Biology gives you a brain. Life gives you a mind.
—Jeffrey Eugenides, Middlesex
Since the 1980s, there is no area of research that has advanced more rapidly than research 
on the brain. At the time I was writing Experiential Learning, much excitement had been 
generated by the split-brain research that identified different functions for the left and 
right hemispheres of the brain. Research by Roger Sperry and others in the 1960s gained 
widespread publicity and popularization when Sperry was awarded the 1981 Nobel Prize 
in Physiology and Medicine. The studies demonstrated that the left and right hemi-
spheres of the brain specialize in different tasks. I saw this as related to William James, 
two modes of knowing the world, apprehension in the right brain and comprehension in 
the left brain (Chapter 3, pp. 71–77). At that time, the field of cognitive neuroscience was 
beginning to thrive as methods for directly examining brain engagement in cognition 
such as the fMRI became available. The 1990s was designated the “decade of the brain” 
by President George W.H. Bush. Today research on brain processes and structure and 
their role in learning is expanding dramatically. In 2008 alone, more than 26,500 refereed 
articles were published in over 400 neuroscience journals. The Society for Neuroscience’s 
first conference in 1979 had 1,300 attendees; by 2000, 24,000 people attended. Today the 
brain has entered popular culture everywhere, and disciplines from education to law 
to marketing to economics to ethics have developed specialties called neuroeducation, 
neurolaw, and so on (Rose and Abi-Rached, 2013).
Recent fMRI research has added substantially to our understanding of James’ dual knowl-
edge theory which formed the foundation for contemporary work on dual-processing 
(Evans, 2008), made popular by Kahneman’s recent book Thinking, Fast and Slow (2011) 
describing apprehension as system 1 and comprehension as system 2. Boyatzis, Roch-
ford, and Jacks (2014) in a recent review of the fMRI studies by their team and others 
give a detailed picture of two large brain networks involved in dual processing—the task 
positive network (TPN) and the default mode network (DMN). Consistent with James’ 
theory, the task positive network and default mode network have a dialectic relationship. 
Neural activity in the task positive network inhibits activity in the default mode network 
and vice versa. The task positive network is important for problem solving, focusing 
attention, decision making, and control of action (system 2). The default mode network 
plays a central role in control of emotions, social cognition, ethical decision-making, 
creativity, and openness to new ideas (system 2).
Macro level interpretations of brain research have used three perspectives on the brain. 
The differentiation between the right and left hemispheres is a lateral one; the others 
88 
Experiential Learning
being up/down (which describes the reptilian brain, the limbic system, and the neo-
cortex), and front to back. A recent paper by Eagleton (2011) combined the lateral per-
spective and the up/down, limbic/cortical perspectives to map the learning cycle on the 
brain. The left limbic senses and experiences through inquiry (CE), the left cortical is for 
reflective observation and critical thinking (RO), the right cortical is for lateral thinking 
and abstract analysis (AC), and the right limbic is for taking action and solving prob-
lems (AE). James Zull’s perspective is primarily front to back “. . . the most striking line 
of functional division in the cortex is the boundary between the somatosensory and the 
primary motor. It divides the cortex into a front half and a back half . . .” (2002, p. 175).
James Zull and the Link between the Learning Cycle  
and Brain Functioning
One of my greatest pleasures in my 40-year academic career at Case Western Reserve 
University is my friendship and collaboration with Jim Zull. When he founded the Uni-
versity Center for Innovation in Teaching and Education (UCITE) in 1994, I served on 
his advisory board, and he and I taught the doctoral course on Learning and Develop-
ment in the Organization Behavior Department for many years. I treasure our many con-
versations on learning and education. His great passion for teaching and his equally great 
passion for biological research are united in his two great books The Art of Changing 
the Brain (2002) and From Brain to Mind (2011). His aim is to understand how Piaget’s 
concept of constructivism in learning could be understood in neurological terms. His 
basic idea is that knowledge resides in networks of neurons in the neocortex constructed 
through learning from experience. In constructivist terms, learning is a process that 
builds on the foundation of each individual’s neuronal structure, and thus every learner 
is unique and will interpret experience uniquely. Learning from experience results in 
modification, growth, and pruning of neurons, synapses, and neuronal networks; thus 
learning physically changes the brain, and educating is the art of changing the brain.
Zull sees a parallel between the learning cycle and the structure of the nervous system 
that creates the neuronal networks (see Figure 3.6). “Put into words, the figure illus-
trates that concrete experiences come through the sensory cortex, reflective observation 
involves the integrative cortex at the back, creating new abstract concepts occurs in the 
frontal integrative cortex, and active testing involves the motor brain. In other words, 
the learning cycle arises from the structure of the brain” (Zull, 2002, pp. 18–19; 2011.) 
While acknowledging the greater complexity of brain functioning, he proposes that these 
regions of the brain are heavily, but not exclusively, involved in the modes of the learning 
cycle. Their respective functions, sensing (CE), remembering (RO), theorizing (AC), and 
acting (AE), he calls the four pillars of learning.
Zull describes a cognitive neuroscience experiment showing that monkeys can distin-
guish cats from dogs, and more importantly, in doing so, they followed the sequence of 
the learning cycle in the pillar brain regions as his theory predicted: “sensory (perceiving 
89
Chapter 3 Structural Foundations of the Learning Process 
major aspects of images of cats and dogs), memory (comparing the perceived image to 
remembered ones), theorizing (deciding the nature of perceived image as cat or dog), 
and testing the judgment by a specific action (pressing a red button if dog and a green 
button if cat)” (2012, p. 171).
Concrete Experience and Sensing—The Sensory Cortex
The sensory cortex receives information from the outside world through the senses. Zull 
describes how it operates: “During concrete experience, physical information from the 
world and from our bodies enters the brain through the sense organs . . . It is then sent in 
parallel to the emotion monitor (amygdala) and the specific parts of the cortex for each 
of the senses. If the amygdala recognizes the experience as dangerous, it will trigger an 
instinctive body action (fight or flight). . . . That is the extreme response. Normally, both 
the emotional and cognitive content of experience are sent to the cortex to be processed 
by the integrative cortex in the parietal and temporal lobes” (2002, p. 137). One implica-
tion of this parallel track is that attention can be diverted by unsafe and threatening con-
ditions making it difficult to focus and take in the details of the experience fully. It also 
helps us understand James’ concept of pure experience (Chapter 2 Update and Reflec-
tions) and why it is clouded by cultural interpretations and memories of previous expe-
riences. The incoming direct experiencing through the senses is immediately identified 
and interpreted on one track or the other before it goes to the frontal cortex for thinking.

Experiential Learning
Zull argues that “sense-luscious” real experiences that flood all the senses are the best for 
learning. “We are more likely to trust sensory input from the experience itself. I suspect 
that this confidence and trust in our sensory experience of the ‘real thing’ has a calming 
effect on our amygdala. And a calmer amygdala means clearer thinking” (2002, p. 145). 
Teachers should do more showing and less telling.
Reflective Observation and Remembering—Back Integrative Cortex
The back integrative cortex integrates sensory information to create images and mean-
ing. It is involved in memory formation and recall, enabling object recognition. It is 
also involved in language comprehension and spatial relationships. One of Zull’s great 
contributions to the study of reflection is his emphasis on the importance of mem-
ory. At the first level of reflection described in the Chapter 2 Update and Reflections, 
experiences are integrated with memories to create meaning as in the simple case of 
naming a person. This is accomplished by integrating the sound of the name with the 
visual image. This memory of the person is extended by neuronal networks distributed 
throughout the cortex that are dynamically growing, connecting, and decaying with 
other memories of the person and our feelings about them. This plasticity results in 
the constant revision of memories over time. The most important part of forming the 
memory is its link with emotion. To endure, the memory must have neuronal pathways 
to emotion structures such as the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and hypothalamus. 
Emotion creates attention, and if we are not paying attention to an experience, it will 
not be sensed. Rich experiences, such as those which change and surprise or use all 
the senses, are more memorable. We may not remember someone’s name because we 
never formed the memory in the first place or because the neuronal connections for 
recall are weak.
Abstract Conceptualization and Theorizing—Front Integrative Cortex
The frontal integrative cortex uses short term memory to choose, plan, problem solve, 
and make decisions. It makes judgments and evaluations directing the rest of the brain 
and actions of the body. It does this through abstract conceptualization, manipulating 
concepts and images to go beyond present knowledge to invent and choose new actions.
This integration is a creative and active, rather than reflective, process. “This means 
that we can change our purpose at any time. We can change our reasons for thinking; 
the content of our thoughts. We can discard specific facts and ideas, and replace them 
with others. We can choose what we want to think about and what problems we want 
to work on, and play with them in our mind. We can identify the elements that make 
up our thoughts, and move them around in our mental pictures as we work toward a 
specific goal or purpose. We can discard things that do not serve our purpose and add 
things that do. All this freedom! All this choice! This is what makes creative integration 
creative” (Zull, 2011, p. 93).
91
Chapter 3 Structural Foundations of the Learning Process 
The integrative front cortex uses working memory to organize a sequence of movements 
that will accomplish a goal. Working memory selects memories and facts from the back 
integrative cortex relevant to the planned action and organizes them into a sequence of 
actions that will solve the problem. This is accomplished by a unique network of neurons 
in the cortex that fires when stimulated but continues firing for a while after the stimulus 
ends, “remembering” the stimulus. But if another stimulus occurs, the firing is inter-
rupted, making short-term memory unstable and limited in how much it can hold. So 
working memory literally requires work and paying attention to avoid being distracted.
These functions are most associated with intelligence, though Zull stresses that the fron-
tal cortex is driven by emotion through the dopamine reward system of the nucleus 
accumbens. The emotional aspects of learning and problem solving are as important as 
the mechanistic ones. It is driven by our desires and needs. He particularly emphasizes 
the feeling of ownership as essential for voluntary purposeful action.
Active Experimentation and Acting—Motor Cortex
Another of Zull’s insights about the learning cycle is the importance of action for learn-
ing. Action closes the learning cycle and reconnects the processing inside the brain with 
the world. It generates consequences there that create new experiences that begin the 
cycle anew. He calls this the “great transformation—changing sensory experience into 
action experience.” This transformation happens in two ways, one directly from the 
sensory cortex to the motor cortex and the other around the learning cycle through the 
back (reflecting) and front (thinking) integrative cortex.
The direct route is illustrated by the simple reflex, stimulus and response with no interven-
ing cognitive activity. More complex activities are exploration and mimicry. Exploration is 
the continuing interaction between sensing and acting as in the way the eyes continuously 
move to explore something. Mimicry is copying sensory information and repeating it in 
action as when a child repeats her mother’s words to learn language. The neurons involved 
in mimicry are called mirror neurons. Mirror neurons match observations with actions 
and are located in Broca’s area, which is responsible for language. Direct recursive cycling 
between experience and action can actually produce skill mastery with little cognitive help 
(see Figure 3.7). Hoover, Giambatista, and Belkin (2012) have called this cycle “vicarious 
observational experiential learning,” suggesting that it lightens the cognitive demands of 
direct experiential learning and is therefore useful as a precursor to learning from direct 
experience, for example, observing a performance before doing it oneself.
The longer route around the learning cycle engages reflection and previous memories, 
coming to the motor cortex where coordinated voluntary muscle contractions that pro-
duce movement are triggered. These movements carry out plans and goals originating in 
the front integrative cortex including the actions of producing language through speech 
and writing.
92 
Experiential Learning
Meta-cognition and the Anterior Cingulate
Zull ends his journey From Brain to Mind (2011) by introducing us to the anterior cin-
gulate. This structure appears to be an evolutionarily new specialization of the neocortex 
containing spindle-shaped neurons that are connected to diverse parts of the brain and 
appear to serve an integrating function for the sensory and motor cortexes and emotional 
centers. It appears to be involved heavily in self-awareness and self-reflective thought, 
as well as emotional self-control and adaptive responses to changing conditions. This 
executive meta-cognitive function is central to self-regulation, deliberate learning, and 
learning how to learn. I will examine these processes in more detail in the Chapter 8 
Update and Reflections.
The meta-cognitive abilities related to the self are essential for the function of episodic 
memory and what Tulving (1983, 2005) calls autonoetic (self-knowing) consciousness: 
“Only through the sophisticated representation of the self can an individual autonoeti-
cally recollect personal events from the past and mentally project one’s existence into 
the subjective future. It is not known which regions of the frontal lobes are especially 
critical for self-awareness but the most anterior regions are good candidates” (Wheeler, 
Stuss, and Tulving, 1997, p. 333). Episodic memory, which includes some semantic 
memory, is different than semantic memory alone in that it recalls events in which

the self participated in context and in time; while semantic memory registers, stores, 
and uses only decontextualized facts of the world, with no sense of when they were 
encountered.
Episodic memory is particularly important for experiential learning because it remem-
bers by re-experiencing and mentally traveling back in time. “Its essence lies in the 
subjective feeling that, in the present experience, one is re-experiencing something that 
has happened before in one’s life . . . the self doing the experiencing now is the same self 
that did it originally” (Wheeling, Stuss, and Tulving, 1997, p. 349). Recall of these per-
sonal episodes forms the basis for future plans and actions. William James says of this 
“remembering” that “remembrance is like a direct feeling: its object is suffused with a 
warmth and intimacy to which no object of mere conception ever attains” (1890, p. 239). 
Most education focuses on semantic memory and thus makes the personal application 
of such facts and ideas in context difficult. The episodic memory of a statistics class, for 
example, may be trying to stay awake by watching formulas written on the blackboard. 
Experiential education and situated learning (Lave and Wenger, 1991), on the other 
hand, would work on using the statistics on a personally relevant research project. This 
episodic memory carries with it ideas on how to apply the concepts in future research.
James Zull on Education
Zull’s books are filled with implications and recommendations for educators and learn-
ers. Here are a few related to experiential learning.
 
■ The opportunities for deep learning are enhanced with a balanced use of all four 
learning modes and their corresponding parts of the brain.
 
■ The learning cycle’s four modes give four times the chance to remember. It is 
metacognitive and produces episodic memory central to future deliberate trans-
fer of learning.
 
■ Emotion influences thinking more than thinking influences emotion. Positive 
emotions (joy) enhance learning.
 
■ Physical changes occur in the brain when we learn. Begin with existing neuronal 
networks which are the physical form of prior knowledge and build on it.
 
■ Learning how to learn should be a focus of education.
 
■ It is better to start with concrete examples rather than abstract principles. 
Abstract principles are where we are, not where the learners are.
 
■ Be careful to not overload the limited capacity of working memory. Shoving 
information in at one end only pushes out information at the other.
 
■ Always provoke an active reaction from learners. A safe environment for failure 
can help in this.

Experiential Learning
My Brain Made Me Do It?
When I studied philosophy as an undergraduate, I was always amused when philoso-
phers would accuse someone who was trying to resolve the problem of mind-body dual-
ism of committing the homunculus fallacy, also known as the Cartesian Theatre. The 
homunculus was a tiny little person inside the head viewing incoming information from 
the senses, interpreting it, deciding what to do, and controlling action. The homunculus 
replaced Descartes’ pineal gland as the seat of the soul and served as a proxy that the 
mind, with its subjective qualities and intentional states, is a solely physical concept. The 
juxtaposition of such silly ideas and mundane examples with deep philosophical issues 
made philosophy fun for me. So, I was surprised to find the term rehabilitated in neuro-
science in the term “cortical homunculus” describing the very real anatomical divisions 
of the sensory and motor cortex (see Figure 3.8) that form the basis for the mimicry/
exploration cycle of learning described above.
Indeed the physicalists appear to have won the day, and it is now generally agreed that the 
mind is a physical phenomenon—the mind is the brain. Even so, it is far from proven. A 
passionate advocate of the mind-is-brain idea, Daniel Dennett, who authored Conscious-
ness Explained (1991), admits that he is only offering steps along the way to that goal. 
Stephen Jay Gould argues that reductionism in integrating the phenomena of mind and

brain must fail for two reasons, “First, emergence, or the entry of novel explanatory rules 
in complex systems, laws arising from nonlinear or nonadditive interactions among con-
stituent parts that therefore, in principle, cannot be discovered from properties of parts 
considered separately. . . . Second, contingency, or the growing importance of ‘unique’ 
historical accidents that cannot, in principle, be predicted, but remain fully accessible to 
factual explanation after their occurrence” (2003, pp. 201–202). Carla Hannaford (1995) 
argues that learning is holistic, involving the whole body, “But we have missed a most 
fundamental and mysterious aspect of the mind: learning, thought, creativity and intelli-
gence are not processes of the brain alone but of the whole body. Sensations, movements, 
emotions and brain integrative functions are grounded in the body. The human qualities 
we associate with the mind can never exist separate from the body” (1995, p. 11).
Jim Zull is with the “brain is mind” majority: “Ultimately even the spiritual is physical. . . . 
A physical brain means a physical mind; meaning itself is physical” (2000, pp. 5–6). My 
view is that brain and mind represent two realms of discourse, two different perspectives 
that are useful for different purposes and together can enhance both perspectives. Brain 
talk is about physiology, neurons, receptors, and neurotransmitters. Mind talk is about 
intentions, ideas, beliefs, emotions, and desires. Ironically, neuroscience has increased 
conversation about consciousness and mind, not eliminated it. I completely support the 
neuroscientists in their pursuit for a deeper and more complete understanding of the 
brain. Their passionate belief in the physical nature of the mind serves them well in their 
drive to achieve this goal. I feel confident that humanity can deal with whatever they 
discover. In the meantime, the humanities discourse of mind and spirit still survives and 
thrives while digesting their discoveries. We have seen how Jim Zull’s humble presenta-
tion of the physical brain enlightens our understanding of how to learn and educate.
Would that always were the case. Disciplines have a way of privileging their discourse 
over others and extending it into areas where they have no expertise, while demeaning 
the expertise of other disciplines. And the “physics envy” of soft social scientists leads 
them to seek legitimacy with the neuro patina. Ordinary folks are impressed by the brain 
images and are led to believe that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a “real” dis-
ease just because it lights up the brain in a fMRI. Whether it does or not, PTSD is very 
real in the experience of those who must deal with it in their daily lives. Some, like Ryan 
and Deci, are concerned that popularization of neuroscience denies choice and free will. 
My brain made me do it. “The sense of self is just a post-behavioral ‘spin,’ whereas the 
brain, reified as if it were an intentional agent does the acting, deciding and gadget acti-
vating. Such interpretations, found pervasively in today’s popular neuropsychology are 
fraught with philosophical confounds. First, the brain replaces the philosophical homun-
culus in this description. Second, the logic is that if the brain is involved, it is therefore 
the ultimate and most relevant cause. No matter that the brain may itself be stimulated 
into action by social events . . . mediated by psychological interpretations and construals 
or that awareness and active reflection can alter these construals” (2004, p. 465).
96 
Experiential Learning
Viewed from the perspective of radical empiricism where everything begins and ends in 
experience, both discourses come together in lived experience. As humans, we live our 
daily lives with both discourses competing to interpret what we are experiencing. Dewey 
call lived experience “immediate empiricism” and agreed with James, radical empiricism 
that, “It is in the concrete thing as experienced that all the grounds and clues to its own 
intellectual and logical rectification are contained” (1905, p. 397). Francisco Varela, the 
creator of embodied experiential learning and autopoiesis agrees: “The only real way to 
do a science of mind is to accept the hard and solid fact that the realm of experience is 
ontologically irreducible. It is what it is. The realm of explanation is also irreducible—it 
is what it is. I cannot do away with explanations. The whole point here is to make these 
two things not just coexist as two separate drawers in the huge chest of drawers of the 
universe, but to actually affect each other. . . . I’m just a very hard-headed, very respect-
ful observer of what’s in front of me; and what’s in front of me is both material causal 
explanations and my experience. Both!” (Davis, 1995, p. 31).
In lived experience we are most comfortable explaining our experience with the dis-
course of mind—perceptions, beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and intentions. However, the 
insights of neuroscience, when integrated with lived experience, can make a difference in 
our lives. Carol Dweck studied the “folk” psychology of school children, specifically their 
common sense understanding of the brain and intelligence. She discovered two different 
views which she called the fixed view, that people are born a certain way and intelligence 
is fixed, and a view that she called incremental, that people can change and become better 
learners. With her research team, she found that teaching neuroscience findings about 
the neuroplasticity of the brain improves their academic performance. Eight 25-minute 
classes for seventh graders focused on the message that “learning changes the brain by 
forming new connections and that students are in charge of this process” (Blackwell, 
 Trzesniewski, and Dweck, 2007, p. 254), which led to increased classroom motivation 
and reversed a decline in grades experienced by the control group. Similarly, Good, 
Aronson, and Inzlicht (2003) found that a similar incremental learning intervention led 
to significant improvements in adolescents’ achievement test scores and Aronson, Fried, 
and Good (2002) found that such teaching led to higher grades among college students. 
The lesson of neuroplasticity is that the mind can shape the brain as much as the brain 
shapes the mind.

Individuality in Learning and the  
Concept of Learning Styles
But the complicated external conditions under which we live, as well as 
the presumably even more complex conditions of our  individual psychic 
disposition, seldom permit a completely  undisturbed flow of our psychic 
activity. Outer circumstances and inner disposition  frequently favor the 
one mechanism, and restrict or hinder the other; whereby a predomi-
nance of one mechanism naturally arises. If this condition becomes in any 
way chronic, a type is produced, namely an habitual attitude, in which 
the one mechanism permanently dominates; not, of course, that the other 
can ever be completely suppressed, inasmuch as it also is an integral 
factor in psychic activity. Hence, there can never occur a pure type in the 
sense that he is entirely possessed of the one mechanism with a complete 
atrophy of the other. A typical attitude always signifies the merely relative 
predominance of one mechanism.
—Carl Jung, Psychological Types
T
he structural model of the learning process described in the last chapter is a 
complex one, capable of producing a rich variety of learning processes that vary 
widely in subtlety and complexity. The model gives the basic prehension pro-
cesses of apprehension and comprehension independent structural status. The same is 
true for the transformation processes of intention and extension. In addition, apprehen-
sion and comprehension as well as intention and extension are dialectically related to one 
another, such that their synthesis produces higher levels of learning. Thus, the learning 
process at any given moment in time may be governed by one or all of these processes 
interacting simultaneously. Over time, control of the learning process may shift from one 
of these structural bases for learning to another. Thus, the structural model of learning 
98 
Experiential Learning
can be likened to a musical instrument and the process of learning to a musical score that 
depicts a succession and combination of notes played on the instrument over time. The 
melodies and themes of a single score form distinctive individual patterns that we will 
call learning styles.
The Scientific Study of Individuality
In this analogy, I am suggesting that the learning process is not identical for all human 
beings. Rather, it appears that the physiological structures that govern learning allow 
for the emergence of unique individual adaptive processes that tend to emphasize some 
adaptive orientations over others. When the matter is viewed from an evolutionary per-
spective, there appears to be good reason for this variability and individuality in human 
learning processes.
Human individuality does not just result from random deviations from a single norma-
tive blueprint; it is a positive, adaptive adjustment of the human species. If there are evo-
lutionary pressures toward “the survival of the fittest” in the human species, these apply 
not to individuals but to the human community as a whole. Survival depends not on the 
evolution of a race of identical supermen but on the emergence of a cooperative human 
community that cherishes and utilizes individual uniqueness (compare Levy, 1980).
Attempts to understand the nature of human individuality and to describe the essential 
dimensions along which individuals vary began long before psychology was a recognized 
field of inquiry. For example, gnostic philosophers of the second century conceived of 
human variability as occurring along three dimensions: the pneumatici (thinking ori-
entation), the psychici (feeling orientation), and the hylici (sensation orientation). In 
the eighteenth century, the poet and philosopher Fredrich Schiller divided people into 
“naive” and sentimental types, paralleling realist and idealist philosophical orientations. 
In the century that followed, Nietzsche developed the famous Apollonian and Dionysian 
typology. In 1923, Carl Jung combined these and other approaches to individuality into 
what must be considered one of the most important books on individual differences ever 
written, Psychological Types. Today, psychology abounds with every type of individual 
difference measures—in traits, values, motives, attitudes, cognitive styles, and so on 
(compare Tyler, 1978).
The scientific study of human individuality poses some fundamental dilemmas. The 
human sciences, unlike the physical sciences, place an equal emphasis on the discovery of 
general laws that apply to all human beings and on the understanding of the functioning 
of the individual case. In chemistry, for example, a researcher is apt to discard a sample 
of a given compound if it does not perform as the general laws of chemistry indicate it 
should. Impurities or contaminants in the sample are usually seen as irrelevant-error 
variance to be eliminated. In the human sciences, however, each sample is a human 
being whose uniqueness and individuality are highly prized, particularly by the person 
99
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
him- or herself. We are interested, therefore, not only in general laws of behavior, but 
in their specific relevance and application for each individual case. The basic dilemma 
for the scientific study of individual differences, therefore, is how to conceive of general 
laws or categories for describing human individuality that do justice to the full array of 
human uniqueness.
Theories describing psychological types or personality styles have been much criti-
cized in this regard. Psychological categorizations of people such as those depicted by 
psychological “types” can too easily become stereotypes that tend to trivialize human 
complexity and thus end up denying human individuality rather than characterizing 
it. In addition, type theories often have a static and fixed connotation to their descrip-
tions of individuals, lending a fatalistic view of human change and development. This 
view often gets translated into a self-fulfilling prophecy, as with the common educa-
tional strategy of “tracking” students on the basis of individual differences and thereby 
perhaps reinforcing those differences. Another problem with type theories is that they 
tend to become somewhat idealized. Descriptions tend to be cast in the form of “pure” 
types, with the caveat that no person actually represents a pure type. We are thus left 
with the problem of describing and attempting to research an ideal profile that does 
not exist empirically.
These problems with type theories seem to stem from the underlying epistemology 
on which they are based. Type theories, like many scientific theories, have tended to 
be based on the epistemological root metaphor of formism (see Chapter 5 for fur-
ther elaboration of the role of root metaphors in epistemology). In the formist episte-
mology, forms or types are the ultimate reality, and individual particulars are simply 
imperfect representations of the universal form or type. Type theories thus easily fall 
into the problems identified above. An alternative epistemological root metaphor, one 
that we will use in our approach to understanding human individuality, is that of con-
textualism. In contextualism, the person is examined in the context of the emerging 
historical event, in the processes by which both the person and event are shaped. In 
the contextualist view, reality is constantly being created by the person’s experience. 
As Dewey notes, “an individual is no longer just a particular, a part without meaning 
save in an inclusive whole, but is a subject, self, a distinctive centre of desire, thinking 
and aspiration” (1958, p. 216).
The implication of the contextualist world view for the study of human individuality is 
that psychological types or styles are not fixed traits but stable states. The stability and 
the endurance of these states in individuals comes not solely from fixed genetic qualities 
or characteristics of human beings; nor, for that matter, does it come solely from the 
stable, fixed demands of environmental circumstances. Rather, stable and enduring pat-
terns of human individuality arise from consistent patterns of transaction between the 
individual and his or her environment. Leona Tyler calls these patterns of transaction 
possibility-processing structures.
100 
Experiential Learning
We can use the general term possibility-processing structures to cover all of these 
concepts having to do with the ways in which the person controls the selection 
of perceptions, activities, and learning situations. Any individual can carry out, 
simultaneously or successively, only a small fraction of the acts for which his 
sense organs, nervous system, and muscles equip him. Only a small fraction of 
the energies constantly bombarding the individual can be responded to. If from 
moment to moment a person had to be aware of all of these stimulating energies, 
all of these possible responses, life would be unbearably complicated and confus-
ing. The reason that one can proceed in most situations to act sensibly without 
having to make hundreds of conscious choices is that one develops organized 
ways of automatically processing most of the kinds of information encountered. 
In computer terms, one does what one is “programmed” to do. Much of the 
programming is the same for all or most of the human race; much is imposed 
by the structure of particular culture and subcultures. But in addition there are 
programs unique to individuals, and these are fundamental to psychological 
individuality (Tyler, 1978, pp. 106–107).
The concept of possibility-processing structure gives central importance to the role of 
individual choice in decision making. The way we process the possibilities of each new 
emerging event determines the range of choices and decisions we see. The choices and 
decisions we make, to some extent, determine the events we live through, and these 
events influence our future choices. Thus, people create themselves through their choice 
of the actual occasions they live through. In Tyler’s words, to some degree we write our 
own “programs.” Human individuality results from the pattern or “program” created by 
our choices and their consequences.
Learning Styles as Possibility-Processing Structures
The complex structure of learning allows for the emergence of individual, unique  
possibility-processing structures or styles of learning. Through their choices of experi-
ence, people program themselves to grasp reality through varying degrees of emphasis 
on apprehension or comprehension. Similarly, they program themselves to transform 
these prehensions via extension and/or intention. This self-programming conditioned by 
experience determines the extent to which the person emphasizes the four modes of the 
learning process: concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, 
and active experimentation (see Figures 4.1 and 4.2 for examples).
To illustrate the variety and complexity of the learning process, let us examine in some 
detail how these processes unfold in the specific situation of playing and learning the 
game of pool. Pool players, be they novice or expert, use a variety of learning strate-
gies in the course of their play. In some of these strategies, we see very clearly the four 
basic elemental forms of learning: AΔI, apprehension transformed by intention; AΔE, 
101
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
apprehension transformed by extension; CΔI, comprehension transformed by intention; 
and CΔE, comprehension transformed by extension. In addition, we also see higher-
order combinations of these basic elemental forms—for example, AΔIΔC, apprehension 
linked via intentional transformation with comprehension.
 
■ CΔE—A very common learning strategy in playing pool is comprehension 
transformed by extension. Here the pool player uses an abstract model or theory 
about how the ball will travel when it is struck with the cue to predict a course 
for the cue ball such that it will strike the object ball into the pocket. The player 
may explicitly recall basic physics, that the angle of incidence equals the angle of 
reflection, and may actually measure out on the table the corresponding angles 
necessary. This strategy emphasizes the abstract conceptualization and active 
experimentation modes of the learning process.
 
■ AΔE—Another common approach is apprehension transformed by extension. 
This learning strategy does not rely on a theoretical model about how the cue 
ball and object ball will travel, but rather focuses on the concrete position of the 
balls on the table. The player relies on a global intuitive feel of the situation. In 
this situation, the player often seems to be making minor adjustments before hit-
ting the ball, with the criteria for these adjustments being not some theoretical 
calculation but the finding of a position that “feels right.” Here, concrete experi-
ence and active experimentation are the dominant learning modes used.
 
■ AΔI—Since pool is an active game, learning through intentional transformations 
is less obvious. Intentional transformation of apprehensions may take the form 
of watching one’s opponent or partner as he or she shoots, or of reflecting on the 
course of one’s own shots. Here, one learns in fairly concrete ways by modeling 
or picking up hints from someone else’s approach to the game or trying to do 
again what one did on the last shot. This strategy relies on reflective observation 
and concrete experience.
 
■ CΔI—Intentional transformation of comprehensions, on the other hand, is a 
kind of inductive model-building process relying on abstract conceptualization 
and reflective observation. For example, one might try to understand the conse-
quences of applying “English” to the ball by compiling and organizing into laws 
one’s observations of the various attempts by oneself and others.
All the learning strategies above taken separately have a certain incompleteness to them. 
Although one can analytically identify certain learning achievements in each of the four 
elementary learning modes just described, more powerful and adaptive forms of  learning 
emerge when these strategies are used in combination. For example, if the theory of 
“English” that I develop through comprehension transformed by intension—CΔI—is 
combined with the empirical testing of hypotheses derived from that theory—CΔE—I 
have developed a way of checking the validity of my inductive process that uses three of 
102 
Experiential Learning
the four modes of the learning process: reflective observation, abstract conceptualization 
and active experimentation (IΔCΔE). Similarly, if I combine these hypotheses about the 
effects of “English” (CΔE) with my concrete feel of the situation (AΔE), these abstract 
ideas about how to impart English to the ball will be translated into the appropriate 
motor and perceptual behavior: I will increase my confidence that my hypotheses about 
“English” have in fact been adequately tested; that is, I did actually hit the ball the way 
I had planned to (CΔEΔA). Thus, these pairwise combinations of elementary learning 
strategies that share a common prehension or transformation mode produce a some-
what higher level of learning beyond the elementary forms. This second-order learning 
includes not only some goal-directed behavior, such as deriving a hypothesis from a 
theory or garnering observations from a specific experience, but also some process for 
testing out how adequately that goal-directed activity has been carried out. This second-
order feedback loop stimulates the development of the learning modality in common 
between the two elementary learning modes. Thus, in the example just cited, the linking 
of apprehension and comprehension through extension allows for increasing sophisti-
cation in extensional learning skills. When apprehension/extension (AΔE) is combined 
with apprehension/intention (AΔI), a similar result occurs. That is, when I relax and hit 
the ball (AΔE) and then watch carefully where it goes (AΔI), my awareness of the situa-
tion becomes more sophisticated and higher-level (EΔAΔI).
The combination of all four of the elementary learning forms produces the highest level 
of learning, emphasizing and developing all four modes of the learning process. Here, 
the specialized achievements of the four elementary learning strategies combine in a uni-
fied adaptive process. Here our pool player observes the events around him/her (AΔI), 
integrates these into theories (IΔC) from which he or she derives hypotheses, which are 
then tested out in action (CΔE), creating new events and experiences (EΔA). Any new 
observations are used to modify theories and adjust action, thereby creating an increas-
ingly sophisticated adaptive process that is progressively attuned to the requirement of 
the game:

If you were to analyze your own approach to learning the game of pool or to spend 
some time observing players at your local pool hall, I suspect you would find that very 
few people follow this highest level of learning much of the time. Some people just 
step up and hit the ball without bothering to look very carefully at where their shot 
went unless it went in the pocket. Others seem to go through a great deal of analysis 
and measurement but seem a bit hesitant on the execution. Thus there seem to be 
103
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
distinctive styles or strategies for learning and playing the game. Yet even when people 
have distinctive styles that rely heavily on one of the elementary learning strategies, 
there are occasions in their learning process when they rely on other of the elementary 
forms and combine these with their preferred orientation into the second and third 
orders of learning.
Individual styles of learning are complex and not easily reducible into simple typolo-
gies—a point to bear in mind as we attempt to describe general patterns of individuality 
in learning. Perhaps the greatest contribution of cognitive-style research has been the 
documentation of the diversity and complexity of cognitive processes and their manifes-
tation in behavior. Three important dimensions of diversity have been identified:
 
■ Within any single theoretical dimension of cognitive functioning, it is possible to 
identify consistent subtypes. For example, it appears that the dimension of cogni-
tive complexity/simplicity can be further divided into at least three distinct sub-
types: the tendency to judge events with few variables versus many; the tendency 
to make fine versus gross distinctions on a given dimension; and the tendency to 
prefer order and structure versus tolerance of ambiguity (Vannoy, 1965).
 
■ Cognitive functioning will vary among people as a function of the area of content 
it is focused on, the so-called cognitive domain. Thus, a person may be concrete 
in his interaction with people and abstract in his work (Stabell, 1973), or children 
will analyze and classify persons differently from nations (Signell, 1966).
 
■ Cultural experience plays a major role in the development and expression 
of cognitive functioning. Lessor (1976) has shown consistent differences in 
 thinking style across different American ethnic groups; Witkin (1976) has 
shown differences in global and abstract functioning in different cultures; and 
Bruner et al. (1966) have shown differences in the rate and direction of cognitive 
development across cultures. Although the evidence is not conclusive, it would 
appear that these cultural differences in cognition, in Michael Cole’s words, 
“reside more in the situations to which cognitive processes are applied than 
in the existence of a process in one cultural group and its absence in another” 
(1971, p. 233). Thus, Cole found that African Kpelle tribesmen were skillful at 
measuring rice but not at measuring distance. Similarly, Wober (1967) found 
that Nigerians function more analytically than Americans when measured by a 
test that emphasizes proprioceptive cues, whereas they were less skilled at visual 
analysis.
Our investigation of learning styles will begin with an examination of generalized differ-
ences in learning orientations based on the degree to which people emphasize the four 
modes of the learning process as measured by a self-report test called the Learning Style 
Inventory. From these investigations we will draw a clearer picture of the programs or 
104 
Experiential Learning
patterns of behavior that characterize the four elementary forms of learning. With these 
patterns as a rough map of the terrain of individuality in learning, the next chapter will 
examine the relationships among these styles of learning and the structure of knowledge. 
Chapter 6 will consider the higher levels of learning and the relation between learning 
and development.
Assessing Individual Learning Styles:  
The Learning Style Inventory
To assess individual orientations toward learning, the Learning Style Inventory (LSI) 
was created. The development of this instrument was guided by four design objectives: 
First, the test should be constructed in such a way that people would respond to it in 
somewhat the same way as they would a learning situation; that is, it should require one 
to resolve the opposing tensions between abstract-concrete and active-reflective orienta-
tions. In technical testing terms, we were seeking a test that was both normative, allowing 
comparisons between individuals in their relative emphasis on a given learning mode 
such as abstract conceptualization, and ipsative, allowing comparisons within individu-
als on their relative emphasis on the four learning modes—for instance, whether they 
emphasized abstract conceptualization more than the other three learning modes in their 
individual approach to learning.
Second, a self-description format was chosen for the inventory, since the notion of 
possibility-processing structure relies heavily on conscious choice and decision. It was 
felt that self-image descriptions might be more powerful determinants of behavioral 
choices and decisions than would performance tests. Third, the inventory was con-
structed with the hope that it would prove to be valid—that the measures of learning 
styles would predict behavior in a way that was consistent with the theory of experiential 
learning. A final consideration was a practical one. The test should be brief and straight-
forward, so that in addition to research uses, it could be used as a means of discussing the 
learning process with those tested and giving them feedback on their own learning styles.
The final form of the test is a nine-item self-description questionnaire. Each item 
asks the respondent to rank-order four words in a way that best describes his or her 
learning style. One word in each item corresponds to one of the four learning modes—
concrete experience (sample word, feeling), reflective observation (watching), abstract 
conceptualization (thinking), and active experimentation (doing). The LSI measures a 
person’s relative emphasis on each of the four modes of the learning process—concrete 
 experience (CE), reflective observation (RO), abstract conceptualization (AC), and 
active experimentation (AE)—plus two combination scores that indicate the extent to 
which the person emphasizes abstractness over concreteness (AC-CE) and the extent 
to which the person emphasizes action over reflection (AE-RO). The four basic learn-
ing modes are defined as follows:
105
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
 
■ An orientation toward concrete experience focuses on being involved in expe-
riences and dealing with immediate human situations in a personal way. It 
emphasizes feeling as opposed to thinking; a concern with the uniqueness and 
complexity of present reality as opposed to theories and generalizations; an 
intuitive, “artistic” approach as opposed to the systematic, scientific approach 
to problems. People with concrete-experience orientation enjoy and are good at 
relating to others. They are often good intuitive decision makers and function 
well in unstructured situations. The person with this orientation values relat-
ing to people and being involved in real situations, and has an open-minded 
approach to life.
 
■ An orientation toward reflective observation focuses on understanding the mean-
ing of ideas and situations by carefully observing and impartially describing 
them. It emphasizes understanding as opposed to practical application; a con-
cern with what is true or how things happen as opposed to what will work; an 
emphasis on reflection as opposed to action. People with a reflective orientation 
enjoy intuiting the meaning of situations and ideas and are good at seeing their 
implications. They are good at looking at things from different perspectives and 
at appreciating different points of view. They like to rely on their own thoughts 
and feelings to form opinions. People with this orientation value patience, 
impartiality, and considered, thoughtful judgment.
 
■ An orientation toward abstract conceptualization focuses on using logic, ideas, 
and concepts. It emphasizes thinking as opposed to feeling; a concern with 
building general theories as opposed to intuitively understanding unique, spe-
cific areas; a scientific as opposed to an artistic approach to problems. A person 
with an abstract-conceptual orientation enjoys and is good at systematic plan-
ning, manipulation of abstract symbols, and quantitative analysis. People with 
this orientation value precision, the rigor and discipline of analyzing ideas, and 
the aesthetic quality of a neat conceptual system.
 
■ An orientation toward active experimentation focuses on actively influencing 
people and changing situations. It emphasizes practical applications as opposed 
to reflective understanding; a pragmatic concern with what works as opposed 
to what is absolute truth; an emphasis on doing as opposed to observing. People 
with an active-experimentation orientation enjoy and are good at getting things 
accomplished. They are willing to take some risk in order to achieve their 
 objectives. They also value having an influence on the environment around 
them and like to see results.
Norms for scores on the LSI were developed from a sample of 1,933 men and women 
ranging in age from 18 to 60 and representing a wide variety of occupations. These 
norms, along with reliability and validity data for the LSI, are reported in detail 
106 
Experiential Learning
elsewhere (Kolb, 1976, 1981). The following sample LSI profiles are included along with 
the respondents’ self-descriptions to illustrate the kind of self-assessment information 
generated by the inventory. The first profile is that of a 20-year-old female social worker 
currently completing a graduate degree in social work (see Figure 4.1). Her high scores 
on concrete experience and active experimentation are evident not only in the content 
of the following excerpts from her self-analysis but also in the way the analysis is written, 
with its strong feeling tone:
The Learning Style exercise and assignment had a tremendous effect on me, 
forcing me to take stock of my standard learning and problem solving pattern. 
And, obviously, these patterns more or less represent my general life patterns and 
attitudes. In the past, I have noted my methods of handling specific problems, 
but the assignment really pulled it all together, which was more than a little ter-
rifying. . . . [She describes her recent experience in choosing an apartment.]
Those are the specifics. I can recall many other examples where my learning and 
problem solving style was exactly the same. In fact, I’m writing this paper right 
now, twenty minutes after class, as a direct result of my poor score on the paper 
just returned to me. If I sat and analyzed what it meant to receive a poor mark, I 
would become too upset. I had to do something about it, to fix it, so I immedi-
ately went home and sat down to write a good paper to prove I could do better.
The general process is clear: When I first become emotionally concerned with 
a problem, the only way I can see to relieve the worry is to jump into action, 
“solving” the problem as quickly as possible. It’s too hard, too hurting, to sit 
and think and analyze. When a problem touches me on a gut level, be it a love 
affair or a beautiful pair of shoes in a store window, I jump to concrete action; I 
accommodate.
During the aforementioned apartment search, as during most of my escapades, 
a little voice in the back of my head knew what was going on and warned and 
cautioned me. Yet I proceeded just the same. It’s as if my process is compulsive 
and inevitable; I feel it to be almost beyond any conscious control on my part.
I realize that my problem solving process is not 100% destructive. My instincts 
are often very good, and I’m just as likely to make the right decision as not, 
based on my experience. In fact, this same compulsive need to act has led me 
into many beautiful and exciting adventures which I wouldn’t have missed for 
the world. What frightens me is my apparent inability to try out other problem 
solving techniques.
My accommodator style [see below, under “Characteristics of the Basic Learn-
ing Styles”] most concerns me in the context of professional situations. When 
107
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
 working with a client, I tend to promote and encourage action choices or solu-
tions before we have fully analyzed the problem at hand; it breaks my heart to see 
a client suffer, so I want to relieve his or her pain with the same medicine I use on 
myself. I am always trying to slow down, to check and double check, to consider 
a wide range of options. But on the other hand, my action instincts have many 
times procured immediate vital services for a client, while my more reflective 
colleagues were still putzing around on paper.
I’m also concerned about the effect of this style on my life plans. I’ve jumped 
from major to major in college, and recently from career to career, without much

careful, consistent reflection and analysis. Again, the benefits are a variety of rich 
experiences at a relatively young age; I have never felt stagnant or bored. The 
consequences are that, up to now, I’ve never allowed myself to realize potential 
in any field. I am presently trying very hard to break that pattern. I am focus-
ing, to the best of my ability, on social work, both academic and practical. I’m 
attempting to discover the joys of thoroughness. It’s not easy. I’m tempted to 
jump around like a little flea. . . .
The process of sorting my thoughts for this paper has meant a great deal to me. 
It took me an hour to sort it out. That may not be much for most people, but 
a concentrated hour of attempting to calmly and reflectively sort my thoughts 
represents a minor miracle for me! And I must admit that it feels good.
The second example is a very different one. It is from a 32-year-old M.B.A. student (see 
Figure 4.2). This man’s high scores on abstract conceptualization and reflective observa-
tion are reflected in a self-interpretation report that is more formal and academic in its 
tone. In addition, he describes his difficulties in valuing and learning from the experi-
ential learning approach taken in the organization behavior course where he completed 
the LSI. In a rather dramatic way, this case demonstrates the powerful effect that learning 
styles can have on the learning process and at the same time reminds us that experiential 
learning techniques per se are not preferred by everyone:
“They, assimilators [see below], are often frustrated and benefit little from 
unstructured ‘discover’ learning approaches such as exercises and simulations.” 
Falling onto the extreme edge of the assimilator category, I, too, have experienced 
frustration with the experiential learning approach and much of the content of 
the course to date. This first conceptual paper will briefly describe my learning 
style, recount some of my experiences in the course, relate my feelings, pres-
ent my intellectual reactions to those experiences and feelings, and outline my 
expected future course of action.
Since the learning process is a dynamic, circular one of building on past expe-
rience and learning, some description of my background is needed to under-
stand my learning style preference. The Learning Styles Inventory very clearly 
identified my assimilator predisposition. Both concrete experience and active 
experimentation scores were inside the twentieth percentile circle. Reflective 
observation was in the middle range, while abstract conceptualization fell on the 
outer circle. This result corresponds well with my formal educational and profes-
sional experience. Typically, both mathematicians and economists are assimila-
tors, drawing on theoretical models to describe reality. My degrees in these areas 
reflect my strength in and affinity for that style of learning. Kolb reports that 
members of the research and planning departments of organizations tend to be 
the most assimilative group. Prior to entering the M.B.A. program, I had spent 
109

two years in such a capacity, leaving __________ college as Associate Director 
of Institutional Research and Planning.
Entering the organizational behavior class, I anticipated difficulty, but did not 
anticipate the wholesale assault on my value system which I encountered. Detail-
ing those incidents and my reactions comprises the body of this essay. Prior 
to describing concrete situations, I need to present my definition of concrete 
and active as they apply to learning. Basically, I propose to generalize from the 
physical definitions to include those activities of the mind which are active and 
concrete, rather than passive and imprecise. For example, much of the active part

of active listening is a mental, rather than a physical, activity. Similarly, for me, 
active participation in a novel, textbook, or journal article is more “active” than 
engaging in typical sporting activities. To view my learning as balanced, rather 
than ivory-towerish, one must surmount what economists term the “fallacy of 
misplaced concreteness.” Cerebral as well as sensual participation in life can be 
concrete and active.
Experiences with classmates, instructors, and the texts have all contributed to 
my feelings of isolation, defensiveness, and frustration. During my group’s first 
discussion session I expressed my distaste for experiential learning. I noted that 
it seemed to be the opposite of normal science or education, where the goal of 
furthering man’s knowledge required building upon the work and achievements 
of others, rather than egocentrically assuming that individuals would be able to 
replicate past acts of genius. I was motivated to get my views on the table so that 
future discussion on my part would be understood in the proper light. Unwit-
tingly, I was combatting what Argyris terms “double loop learning.” I was imme-
diately questioning the rules of the game by putting my views forward.
Reaction by some other members of the group was swift and harsh. Replies such 
as, “You can’t learn anything from books,” and “Books are irrelevant to business, 
you learn by doing,” shocked me. Coming from an institution (___________ 
College) where life revolved almost entirely around intellectual activities, I was 
surprised to find that students at an apparently similar school possessed anti-
intellectual attitudes.
Our group leader reported this discussion as, “One of our members said that he 
preferred passive learning, had gone to a school where experiential learning was 
used, and did not like it.” The whole group’s reaction was surprise. I felt embar-
rassed and misunderstood, wanted to defend my views and straighten out the 
group leader. Feelings of isolation and serious questioning of my reasons for 
being in business school followed that session.
During the second group session, a number of our group members discussed 
the Learning Styles Inventory. One member questioned the validity of the mea-
surement and what it really measured. I presented my views on inductive versus 
deductive reasoning and the difficulty of constructing an index which is uni-
dimensional. One group member remarked, “I never know what he’s talking 
about,” leading to snickers from the group. Score crushed ego and feelings a 
third time.
The physical placement of students on the Learning Styles Inventory grid in the 
lounge further confirmed my feelings of isolation. From my perspective, four 
students were extreme assimilators, eight others were assimilators near the cen-
111
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
ter, ten were convergers, twelve were divergers, and twenty were accommodators. 
The four members of our group discussed the advantages and disadvantages of 
assimilation as a learning style, questioned the realism of our goals in manage-
ment vis-à-vis our learning orientation, and related the LSI to our majors and 
computer programming. I felt a sense of community and cohesion forming in 
the group. In particular, a lawyer and I confirmed our commonality of vision.
This activity did result in constructive reflection on my part. It appears to me 
that people under stress or feeling isolated seek others with similar feelings for 
security. In addition, the experience spurred me to look in the reader for more 
information. The last article presented findings on the distribution of academics 
majors on the LSI grid which satisfied some of my curiousity about the applica-
bility of the inventory. . . .
Evidence for the Structure of Learning
The structural model of learning developed in the preceding chapter postulates two fun-
damental dimensions of the learning process, each describing basic adaptive processes 
standing in dialectical opposition. The prehension dimension opposes the process of 
apprehension and an orientation toward concrete experience against the comprehen-
sion process and an orientation toward abstract conceptualization. The transformation 
dimension opposes the process of intention and reflective observation against the  process 
of extension and active experimentation. We have emphasized that these dimensions 
are not unitary theoretically, such that a high score on one orientation would automati-
cally imply a low score on its opposite, but rather that they are dialectically opposed, 
implying that a higher-order synthesis of opposing orientations makes highly devel-
oped strengths in opposing orientations possible. If this reasoning is applied to scores 
on the Learning Style Inventory, we would predict a moderate (but not perfect) nega-
tive relation between abstract conceptualization and concrete experience and a similar 
negative relation between active experimentation and reflective observation. Other cor-
relations should be near zero. Intercorrelations of the scale scores for a sample of 807 
people shows this to be the case (see Kolb, 1976, for details). CE and AC were nega-
tively correlated (-.57, p < .001). RO and AE were negatively correlated (-.50, p < .001). 
Other correlations were low but significant because of the large sample size (CE) with  
RO = .13, RO with AC = -.19, AC with AE = -.12, and AE with CE = -.02). All but 
the last are significant (p < .001). As a result of the intercorrelations, we felt justified in 
creating two combination scores to measure the abstract/concrete dimension (AE-CE) 
and active/reflective dimension (AE-RO). With the abstract/concrete dimension, CE 
correlated -.85 and AC correlated .90. With the active/reflective dimension, AE corre-
lated .85 and RO correlated -.84. Subsequent studies with more limited and specialized 
populations have shown patterns of correlation similar to those described above. One 
112 
Experiential Learning
longitudinal study of changes in learning style during college examined the relation-
ship between the Learning Style Inventory and commonly used instruments designed 
to measure cognitive development according to Piaget, Kohlberg, Loevinger, and Perry 
theoretical descriptions of growth. Analyses of the interrelationships of college student 
performance on these measures found that the concrete/abstract dimension correlated 
with these measures. The reflective/active dimension did not. For these college students, 
dimensions of learning and development designed to tap cognitive growth do not reflect 
movement on the reflective/active dimension. The latter dimension also does not cor-
relate with age at entrance to college for younger or older students, which supports the 
idea that the two dimensions are independent (Mentkowski and Strait, 1983).
A more rigorous test of these hypothesized relationships requires controlling for the 
built-in negative correlations in the LSI caused by the forced-ranking procedure and 
validation of the scales against external criteria. It is possible to control for the “bias” 
introduced by the forced-choice format of the LSI by using data from a study by Certo 
and Lamb (1979), who generated 1,000 random responses to the LSI instrument and 
intercorrelated the resulting scale scores. The resulting correlations measure the mag-
nitude of the inbuilt negative correlations in the LSI. If these correlations are used as 
the null hypothesis instead of the traditional zero point to test for significance of differ-
ence, the hypothesized negative relationships between AC and CE and between AE and 
RO can be tested with the forced-ranking effect partialed out. Thus, when Certo and 
Lamb’s  random correlations are compared to the empirical correlations obtained from 
807 subjects using the formula provided by McNemar (1957, p. 148), both the AC/CE 
correlations and AE/RO correlations are significantly more negative than the random 
correlations (random AC/CE = -.26, empirical = -.57, p of difference < .001; random 
AE/RO = -.35, empirical = -.50, p of difference < .001).
External validation of these negative relationships comes from a recent study by Gypen 
(1980). He correlated ratings by professional social workers and engineers of the extent 
to which they were oriented toward each of the four learning modes in their current job 
with their LSI scores obtained four to six months earlier. Each mode was rated separately 
on a seven-point scale describing the learning mode in a way that attempted to minimize 
social-desirability bias. Table 4.1 shows the correlations between the subjects’ LSI scores 
and self-ratings of their current job orientation. These results provide strong support for 
the negative relation between concrete experience and abstract conceptualization, and 
somewhat weaker support for the negative relation between active experimentation and 
reflective observation. The Gypen study and the “corrected” internal correlations among 
LSI scales both demonstrate empirical support for the bipolar nature of the experiential 
learning model that is independent of the forced-ranking method used in the LSI.
Although these data do not prove validity of the structural learning model, they do 
suggest an analytic heuristic for exploring with the LSI the characteristics of the four 
elemental forms of knowing proposed by the model (refer to Figure 3.1). If for purposes 
113
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
of analysis we treat the abstract-concrete (AC-CE) and active-reflective (AE-RO) 
dimensions as negatively related in a unidimensional sense, it is possible to create a 
two-dimensional map of learning space that can be used to empirically characterize dif-
ferences in the four elementary forms of knowing: convergence, divergence, assimilation, 
and accommodation. In so doing, I will save the third dimension for depicting in Chapter 
6 the process of development and higher forms of knowing achieved through the dialectic 
synthesis of action/reflection and abstract/concrete orientations.
Since the AC and CE scales and AE and RO scales are not perfectly negatively correlated, 
two other types of LSI scores do in fact occur occasionally: those that are highest on AC 
and CE, and those that are highest on AE and RO. These so-called “mixed” types of 
people, on the basis of what fragmentary evidence we have, seem to be those who rely 
on the second- and third-order levels of learning. Thus, through integrative learning 
experiences, these people have developed styles that emphasize the dialectically opposed 
orientations. Some support for this argument comes from Rita Weathersby’s study of 
adult learners at Goddard College (1977). The important point, however, is that the LSI 
measures differences only in the elementary knowledge orientations, since the forced-
ranking format of the inventory precludes integrative responses.

Characteristics of the Basic Learning Styles
In using the analytic heuristic of a two-dimensional-learning-style map, it is proposed 
that a major source of pattern and coherence in individual styles of learning is the under-
lying structure of the learning process. Over time, individuals develop unique possibility- 
processing structures such that the dialectic tensions between the prehension and trans-
formation dimensions are consistently resolved in a characteristic fashion. As a result of 
our hereditary equipment, our particular past life experience, and the demands of our 
present environment, most people develop learning styles that emphasize some learn-
ing abilities over others. Through socialization experiences in family, school, and work, 
we come to resolve the conflicts between being active and reflective and between being 
immediate and analytical in characteristic ways, thus lending to reliance on one of the 
four basic forms of knowing: divergence, achieved by reliance on apprehension trans-
formed by intention; assimilation, achieved by comprehension transformed by intention; 
convergence, achieved through extensive transformation of comprehension; and accom-
modation, achieved through extensive transformation of apprehension.
Some people develop minds that excel at assimilating disparate facts into coherent theo-
ries, yet these same people are incapable of or uninterested in deducing hypotheses from 
the theory. Others are logical geniuses but find it impossible to involve and surrender 
themselves to an experience. And so on. A mathematician may come to place great 
emphasis on abstract concepts, whereas a poet may value concrete experience more 
highly. A manager may be primarily concerned with the active application of ideas, 
whereas a naturalist may develop his observational skills highly. Each of us in a unique 
way develops a learning style that has some weak and some strong points. Evidence for 
the existence of such consistent unique learning styles can be found in the research of 
Kagan and Witkin (Kagan and Kogan, 1970). They find, in support of Piaget, that there 
is a general tendency to become more analytic and reflective with age, but that individual 
rankings within the population tested remain highly stable from early years to adult-
hood. Similar results have been found for measures of introversion/extraversion. Several 
longitudinal studies have shown introversion/extraversion to be one of the most stable 
characteristics of personality from childhood to old age. Although there is a general 
tendency toward introversion in old age, studies show that people tend to retain their 
relative ranking throughout their life span (Rubin, 1981). Thus, they seem to develop 
consistent stable learning or cognitive styles relative to their age mates. The following is 
a description of the characteristics of the four basic learning styles based on both research 
and clinical observation of these patterns of LSI scores.
 
■ The convergent learning style relies primarily on the dominant learning abilities 
of abstract conceptualization and active experimentation. The greatest strength 
of this approach lies in problem solving, decision making, and the practical 
application of ideas. We have called this learning style the converger because 
a person with this style seems to do best in situations like conventional intel-
115
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
ligence tests, where there is a single correct answer or solution to a question 
or problem (Torrealba, 1972; Kolb, 1976). In this learning style, knowledge is 
organized in such a way that through hypothetical-deductive reasoning, it can 
be focused on specific problems. Liam Hudson’s (1966) research on those with 
this style of learning (using other measures than the LSI) shows that convergent 
people are controlled in their expression of emotion. They prefer dealing with 
technical tasks and problems rather than social and interpersonal issues.
 
■ The divergent learning style has the opposite learning strengths from conver-
gence, emphasizing concrete experience and reflective observation. The greatest 
strength of this orientation lies in imaginative ability and awareness of mean-
ing and values. The primary adaptive ability of divergence is to view concrete 
situations from many perspectives and to organize many relationships into 
a meaningful “gestalt.” The emphasis in this orientation is on adaptation by 
observation rather than action. This style is called diverger because a person 
of this type performs better in situations that call for generation of alternative 
ideas and implications, such as a “brainstorming” idea session. Those oriented 
toward divergence are interested in people and tend to be imaginative and 
 feeling-oriented.
 
■ In assimilation, the dominant learning abilities are abstract conceptualiza-
tion and reflective observation. The greatest strength of this orientation lies in 
inductive reasoning and the ability to create theoretical models, in assimilating 
disparate observations into an integrated explanation (Grochow, 1973). As in 
convergence, this orientation is less focused on people and more concerned with 
ideas and abstract concepts. Ideas, however, are judged less in this orientation 
by their practical value. Here, it is more important that the theory be logically 
sound and precise.
 
■ The accommodative learning style has the opposite strengths from assimila-
tion, emphasizing concrete experience and active experimentation. The greatest 
strength of this orientation lies in doing things, in carrying out plans and tasks 
and getting involved in new experiences. The adaptive emphasis of this orienta-
tion is on opportunity seeking, risk taking, and action. This style is called accom-
modation because it is best suited for those situations where one must adapt 
oneself to changing immediate circumstances. In situations where the theory 
or plans do not fit the facts, those with an accommodative style will most likely 
discard the plan or theory. (With the opposite learning style, assimilation, one 
would be more likely to disregard or reexamine the facts.) People with an accom-
modative orientation tend to solve problems in an intuitive trial-and-error man-
ner (Grochow, 1973), relying heavily on other people for information rather than 
on their own analytic ability (Stabell, 1973). Those with accommodative learning 
styles are at ease with people but are sometimes seen as impatient and “pushy.”
116 
Experiential Learning
The patterns of behavior associated with these four learning styles are shown consistently 
at various levels of behavior, from personality type to specific task-oriented skills and 
behaviors. We will examine these patterns at five such levels: (1) Jungian personality 
type, (2) early educational specialization, (3) professional career, (4) current job, and (5) 
adaptive competencies.
Personality Type and Learning Style
We have already acknowledged and examined to some extent the indebtedness of 
experiential learning theory to Jung’s theory of psychological types. Now we examine 
more specifically the relations between Jung’s types and the four basic learning styles. 
In his theory of psychological types, Jung developed a holistic framework for describ-
ing differences in human adaptive processes. He began by distinguishing between 
those people who are oriented toward the external world and those oriented toward 
the internal world—the distinction between extravert and introvert examined in the 
last chapter. He then proceeded to identify four basic functions of human adapta-
tion—two describing alternative ways of perceiving, sensation and intuition; and two 
that describe alternative ways of making judgments about the world, thinking and 
feeling. In his view, human individuality develops through transactions with the social 
environment that reward and develop one function over another. He saw that this 
specialized adaptation is in service of society’s need for specialized skills to meet the 
differentiated, specialized role demands required for the survival of and development 
of culture. Jung saw a basic conflict between the specialized psychological orientations 
required for the development of society and the need for people to develop and express 
all the psychological functions for their own individual fulfillment. His concept of 
individuation describes the process whereby people achieve personal integrity through 
the development and reassertion of the nonexpressed and nondominant functions 
integrating them with their dominant specialized orientation into a fluid, holistic 
adaptive process. He describes the conflict between specialized types and individual 
development in this way:
The natural, instinctive course, like everything in nature, follows the principle 
of least resistance. One man is rather more gifted here, another there; or, again, 
adaptation to the early environment of childhood may demand either relatively 
more restraint and reflection or relatively more sympathy and participation, 
according to the nature of the parents and other circumstances. Thereby a certain 
preferential attitude is automatically moulded, which results in different types. 
Insofar then as every man, as a relatively stable being, possesses all the basic psy-
chological functions, it would be a psychological necessity with a view to perfect 
adaptation that he should also employ them in equal measure. For there must 
be a reason why there are different ways of psychological adaptation: Evidently 
one alone is not sufficient, since the object seems to be only partially compre-
hended when, for example, it is either merely thought or merely felt. Through a 
117
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
one-sided (typical) attitude there remains a deficit in the resulting psychological 
adaptation, which accumulates during the course of life; from this deficiency a 
derangement of adaptation develops, which forces the subject towards a com-
pensation. [Jung, 1923, p. 28]
Thus, his conception of types or styles is identical to that proposed here—a basic but 
incomplete form of adaptation with the potential for development via integration with 
other basic types into a fluid, holistic adaptive process.
Jung’s typology of psychological types includes four such pairs of dialectically opposed 
adaptive orientations, describing individuals’ (1) mode of relation to the world via 
 introversion or extroversion, (2) mode of decision making via perception or judgment, 
(3) preferred way of perceiving via sensing or intuition, and (4) preferred way of judging 
via thinking or feeling. These opposing orientations are described in Table 4.2.

As was indicated in the preceding chapter, there is a correspondence between the Jung-
ian concepts of introversion and the experiential learning mode of reflective observation 
via intentional transformation, and between extraversion and active experimentation 
via extension. In addition, concrete experience and the apprehension process are clearly 
associated with both the sensing approach to perception and the feeling approach to 
judging. Abstract conceptualization and the comprehension process, on the other hand, 
are related to the intuition approach to perceiving and the thinking approach to judg-
ing. Predictions about perception and judgment types are difficult to make, since this 
118 
Experiential Learning
 preference is a second-order one; for instance, if I prefer perception, I could perform 
it via sensing or intuition. Myers-Briggs states, “In practice the JP preference is a by-
product of the choice as to which process, of the two liked best (N over S or T over F), 
shall govern one’s life” (1962, p. 59).
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a widely used psychological self-report 
instrument used to assess people’s orientation toward the Jungian types (Myers, 1962). 
Correlations between individuals’ scores on the MBTI and the LSI should give some 
empirical indication of validity of relationships between Jung’s personality types and 
the learning styles proposed above. Some caution in using such data is appropriate, 
however. First, both the LSI and the MBTI instruments are based on self-analysis and 
report. Thus, we are testing whether those who take the two tests agree with our predic-
tions of the similarity between Jung’s concepts and those of experiential learning theory; 
we are not testing, except by inference, their actual behavior. Second, it is not clear how 
adequately the MBTI reflects Jung’s theory. In particular, the items in the MBTI introver-
sion/extraversion scale seem to be heavily weighted in favor of the American conception 
of the dimension mentioned earlier—extraversion as social and interpersonal ease, and 
introversion as shyness and social awkwardness.
Table 4.3 reports data from three studies by different investigators of three populations: 
Kent State undergraduates (Taylor, 1973), University of Wisconsin M.B.A.s (Wynne, 
1975), and education administrators (McBer and Company, personal communication). 
The data in Table 4.3 tend to support our hypotheses, but not consistently in all groups: 
The strongest and most consistent relationships appear to be between concrete/abstract 
and feeling/thinking and between active/reflective and extravert/introvert.
In a more systematic study of 220 managers and M.B.A. students, Margerison and Lewis 
(1979) investigated the relations between LSI and MBTI scores using the technique of 
canonical correlation. They found a significant canonical correlation of .45 (p < .01) 
between the two sets of test scores. When the resulting pattern of psychological types is 
plotted on the two-dimensional LSI learning-space, relationships between the Jungian 
types and learning styles become clear and consistent with our predictions (see Figure 
4.3). The sensing type is associated with the accommodative learning style, and the intui-
tive type falls in the assimilative quadrant; the feeling personality type is divergent in 
learning style, and thinking types are convergent.
Regarding introversion and extraversion, Margerison and Lewis conclude:
It is clear that extroverts describe themselves as very active in learning situations. 
This is to be expected, in that extroverts use their energy to go out into their 
environment and enjoy contact with people and things. In contrast, introverts 
are far more reflective as would be expected. However, it is noticeable that both 
extroverts and introverts prefer involvement in learning situations which are 
neither excessively detached nor concrete. Clearly, while there is a fair degree of

The Relations between Learning Styles and Jung’s Psychological Types
Source: Adapted from C. J. Margerison and R. G. Lewis, How Work Preferences Relate to Learning Styles 
(Bedfordshire, England: Cranfield School of Management, 1979).
1.  The procedure for determining types and dominant and auxiliary processes is complicated (see Myers, 
1962, pp. 51–62, and Appendix A1–A8). Basically, the choice of introversion or extraversion plus the 
choice of a single perceiving or judgment mode determines a dominant process.
variance, the evidence from our sample illustrates that there is little difference 
between introverts and extroverts overall in this aspect. The real difference is 
in their emphasis on a preference for active as against reflective types of role. 
 [Margerison and Lewis, 1979, p. 13]
They also find judgment related to the abstract-conceptualization mode and perception 
related to concrete experience, but unrelated to action or reflection.
Taken together, these studies suggest that the Jungian personality type associated 
with the accommodative learning style is extraverted sensing.1 This personality type 
121
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
as described by Myers is remarkably similar to our description of the accommodative 
learning  orientation:
This combination makes the adaptable realist, who good-naturedly accepts and 
uses the facts around him, whatever they are. He knows what they are, since he 
notices and remembers more than any other type. He knows what goes on, who 
wants what, who doesn’t, and usually why. And he does not fight those facts. 
There is a sort of effortless economy in the way he goes at a situation, never use-
lessly bucking the line.
Often he can get other people to adapt, too. Being a perceptive type, he looks for 
the satisfying solution, instead of trying to impose any “should” or “must” of his 
own, and people generally like him well enough to consider any compromise that 
he thinks “might work.” He is unprejudiced, open-minded, and usually patient, 
easygoing and tolerant of everyone (including himself). He enjoys life. He doesn’t 
get wrought up. Thus he may be very good at easing a tense situation and pulling 
conflicting factions together. . . .
Being a realist, he gets far more from first-hand experience than from books, is 
more effective on the job than on written tests, and is doubly effective when he is 
on familiar ground. Seeing the value of new ideas, theories and possibilities may 
well come a bit hard, because intuition is his least developed process. [Myers, 
1962, p. A5]
The divergent learning style is associated with the personality type having introversion 
and feeling as the dominant process. Here again, Myers’s description of this type fits ours:
An introverted feeling type has as much wealth of feeling as an extraverted feel-
ing type, but uses it differently. He cares more deeply about fewer things. He has 
his warm side inside (like a fur-lined coat). It is quite as warm but not as obvious; 
it may hardly show till you get past his reserve. He has, too, a great faithfulness to 
duty and obligations. He chooses his final values without reference to the judg-
ment of outsiders, and sticks to them with passionate conviction. He finds these 
inner loyalties and ideals hard to talk about, but they govern his life.
His outer personality is mostly due to his auxiliary process, either S or N, and so 
is perceptive. He is tolerant, open-minded, understanding, flexible and adapt-
able (though when one of his inner loyalties is threatened, he will not give an 
inch). Except for his work’s sake, he has little wish to impress or dominate. The 
contacts he prizes are with people who understand his values and the goals he is 
working toward.
He is twice as good when working at a job he believes in, since his feeling for 
it puts added energy behind his efforts. He wants his work to contribute to 
122 
Experiential Learning
 something that matters to him, perhaps to human understanding or happiness 
or health, or perhaps to the perfecting of some product or undertaking. He wants 
to have a purpose beyond his paycheck, no matter how big the check. He is a 
perfectionist wherever his feeling is engaged, and is usually happiest at some 
individual work involving personal values. With high ability, he may be good in 
literature, art, science, or psychology. [Myers, 1962, p. A4]
The assimilative learning style is characterized by the introverted intuitive type. Myers’s 
description of this type is similar to the description of the assimilative conceptual orien-
tation but suggests a slightly more practical orientation than we indicate:
The introverted intuitive is the outstanding innovator in the field of ideas, prin-
ciples and systems of thought. He trusts his own intuitive insight as to the true 
relationships and meanings of things, regardless of established authority or pop-
ularly accepted beliefs. His faith in his inner vision of the possibilities is such that 
he can remove mountains—and often does. In the process he may drive others, 
or oppose them, as hard as his own inspirations drive him. Problems only stimu-
late him; the impossible takes a little longer, but not much.
His outer personality is judging, being mainly due to his auxiliary, either T or F. 
Thus he backs up his original insight with the determination, perseverance, and 
enduring purpose of a judging type. He wants his ideas worked out in practice, 
applied and accepted, and spends any time and effort necessary to that end. 
[Myers, 1962, p. A8]
The convergent learning style is characterized by the extraverted thinking type. Here, 
Myers’s description is very consistent with the learning orientation of convergence:
The extraverted thinker uses his thinking to run as much of the world as may 
be his to run. He has great respect for impersonal truth, thought-out plans, and 
orderly efficiency. He is analytic, impersonal, objectively critical, and not likely 
to be convinced by anything but reasoning. He organizes facts, situations, and 
operations well in advance, and makes a systematic effort to reach his carefully 
planned objectives on schedule. He believes everybody’s conduct should be gov-
erned by logic, and governs his own that way so far as he can.
He lives his life according to a definite set of rules that embody his basic judg-
ments about the world. Any change in his ways requires a conscious change in 
the rules.
He enjoys being an executive, and puts a great deal of himself into such a job. He 
likes to decide what ought to be done and to give the requisite orders. He abhors 
confusion, inefficiency, halfway measures, and anything aimless and ineffective. 
He can be a crisp disciplinarian, and can fire a person who ought to be fired. 
[Myers, 1962, p. A1]

Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
Educational Specialization
A major function of education is to shape students’ attitudes and orientations toward 
learning—to instill positive attitudes toward learning and a thirst for knowledge, and to 
develop effective learning skills. Early educational experiences shape individual learning 
styles; we are taught how to learn. Although the early years of education are for the most 
part generalized, there is an increasing process of specialization that develops beginning 
in earnest in high school and, for those who continue to college, developing into greater 
depth in the undergraduate years. This is a specialization in particular realms of social 
knowledge; thus, we would expect to see relations between people’s learning styles and 
the early training they received in an educational specialty or discipline.
These differences in learning styles can be illustrated graphically by the correspondence 
between people’s LSI scores and their undergraduate majors. This is done by plotting the 
average LSI scores for managers in our sample who reported their undergraduate col-
lege major; only those majors with more than ten people responding are included (see 
 Figure 4.4). When we examine these people who share a common professional commitment

to management, we see that some of the differences in their learning orientations are 
explained by their early educational specializations in college. Undergraduate business 
majors tend to have accommodative learning styles; engineers on the average fall in the 
convergent quadrant; history, English, political science, and psychology majors all have 
divergent learning styles; mathematics, economics, sociology, and chemistry majors have 
assimilative learning styles; physics majors are very abstract, falling between the conver-
gent and assimilative quadrants.
Some cautions are in order in interpreting these data. First, it should be remembered that 
all the people in the sample are managers or managers-to-be. In addition, most of them 
have completed or are in graduate school. These two facts should produce learning styles 
that are somewhat more active and abstract than those of the population at large (as indi-
cated by total sample mean scores on AC-CE and AE-RO of +4.5 and +2.9, respectively). 
The interaction among career, high level of education, and undergraduate major may 
produce distinctive learning styles. For example, physicists who are not in industry may 
be somewhat more reflective than those in this sample. Second, undergraduate majors 
are described only in the most gross terms. There are many forms of engineering or 
psychology. A business major at one school can be quite different from one at another.
Liam Hudson’s (1966) work on convergent and divergent learning styles predicts that 
people with undergraduate majors in the arts would be divergers and that those who 
major in the physical sciences would be convergers. Social-science majors should 
fall between these two groups. In order to test Hudson’s predictions about the aca-
demic specialities of convergers and divergers, the data on undergraduate majors were 
grouped into three categories: the arts (English, foreign language, education/liberal 
arts, philosophy, history, and other miscellaneous majors such as music, not recorded 
in Figure 4.4, total n = 137); social science (psychology, sociology/anthropology, busi-
ness, economics, political science, n = 169); and physical science (engineering, physics, 
chemistry, mathematics, and other sciences, such as geology, n = 277). The prediction 
was that the arts should be concrete and reflective and the physical sciences should 
be abstract and active, with the social sciences falling in between. The mean scores 
for these three groups of the six LSI scales are shown in Table 4.4. All these differ-
ences are highly significant and in the predicted direction, with the exception that the 
social sciences and physical sciences do not differ significantly on the active/reflective 
dimension.
Another pattern of significance in the data portrayed in Figure 4.4 is the fact that manag-
ers who majored in basic academic disciplines are far more reflective in their learning 
styles than are the managers who made early professional career commitments in either 
business or engineering. As we will discuss in greater depth later (see Chapter 7), the tra-
ditional nonprofessional collegiate learning environment is highly reflective and devel-
ops this orientation in its students. As a result, the transition from education to work 
involves for many a transition from a reflective learning orientation to an active one.

What these data show is that one’s undergraduate education is a major factor in the 
development of his or her learning style. Whether this is because people are shaped by 
the fields they enter or because of the selection processes that put people into and out of 
disciplines is an open question at this point. Most probably, both factors are operating—
people choose fields that are consistent with their learning styles and are further shaped 
to fit the learning norms of their field once they are in it. When there is a mismatch 
between the field’s learning norms and the individual’s learning style, people will either 
change or leave the field.
Professional Career
A third set of forces that shape learning style stems from professional career choice. One’s 
professional career choice not only exposes one to a specialized learning environment; 
it also involves a commitment to a generic professional problem, such as social service, 
that requires a specialized adaptive orientation. In addition, one becomes a member of a 
reference group of peers who share a professional mentality, a common set of values and 
beliefs about how one should behave professionally. This professional orientation shapes 
learning style through habits acquired in professional training and through the more 
immediate normative pressures involved in being a competent professional (see Chapter 
7, p. 261). In engineering, for example, this involves adapting a rigorous scientific and 
objective stance toward problems. In nursing, it may involve compassion and caring for 
the sick. In management, much of the professional orientation centers on decisiveness 
and a pragmatic orientation.
Learning Style Inventory scores have been collected for a number of different professional 
groups, allowing a comparison between them. The studies are not representative samples 
of the professions and hence cannot with certainty be said to describe each profession 
as a whole. They do, however, offer reasonable indications of the learning-style orienta-
tions that characterize the different professions. The results of these studies are shown 
in Figure 4.5. The first conclusion to be drawn from this figure is that the professions in 
general have an active, as opposed to a reflective, learning orientation. The social profes-
sions—education, nursing, social work, and agricultural extension—comprise people 
who are heavily or primarily accommodative in their learning style. Professions with a 
technical or scientific base—accounting, engineering, medicine, and, to a lesser degree, 
management—have people with primarily convergent learning styles. There is consider-
able variation around these professional averages, however. In medicine, for example, 
about half of practitioners and students are convergers (Plovnick, 1974; Wunderlich and 
Gjerde, 1978), but some medical specialties, such as occupational therapy, are accommo-
dative in their orientation. In social work and nursing, practitioners are clearly concrete 
as opposed to abstract but fall heavily in the diverger as well as accommodator quadrant 
(Sims, 1980; Christensen and Bugg, 1979). As will be seen in the next section, some of 
this variation can be accounted for by the professional’s specific job role.

Current Job Role
The fourth level of factors influencing learning style is the person’s current job role. The task

Experiential Learning
decision making in uncertain emergent circumstances require an accommodative learning 
style. Personal jobs, such as counseling or personnel administrator, that require the estab-
lishment of personal relationships and effective communication with other people demand 
a divergent learning style. Information jobs, such as planning and research, that require data 
gathering and analysis and conceptual modeling have an assimilative learning-style require-
ment. Technical jobs, such as bench engineering and production, that require technical and 
problem-solving skills require a convergent learning orientation.
These differences in the demands of jobs can be illustrated by an examination of variations 
among the learning styles of managers in different jobs in a single industrial firm. (For a 
more detailed analysis of this data, see Weisner, 1971.) We studied about 20 managers 
from each of five functional groups in a midwestern division of a large American industrial 
corporation. The five functional groups are described below, followed by our hypothesis 
about the learning style that should characterize each group given the nature of the work.
 
1. Marketing (n = 20). This group is made up primarily of former salesmen. They 
have a nonquantitative, “intuitive” approach to their work. Because of their prac-
tical sales orientation in meeting customer demand, they should have accommo-
dative learning styles.
 
2. Research (n = 22). The work of this group is split about 50/50 between pio-
neer research and applied research projects. The emphasis is on basic research. 
Researchers should be the most assimilative group.
 
3. Personnel/Labor Relations (n = 20). In this company, men from this depart-
ment serve two primary functions, interpreting personnel policy and promoting 
interaction among groups to reduce conflict and disagreement. Because of their 
“people orientation,” these men should be predominantly divergers.
 
4. Engineering (n = 18). This group is made up primarily of design engineers who 
are quite production-oriented. They should be the most convergent subgroup, 
although they should be less abstract than the research group. They represent a 
bridge between thought and action.
 
5. Finance (n = 20). This group has a strong computer, information-system bias. 
Finance men, given their orientation toward the mathematical task of 
information-system design, should be highly abstract. Their crucial role in 
organizational survival should produce an active orientation. Thus, finance-group 
members should have convergent learning styles.
Figure 4.6 shows the average scores on the active/reflective (AE-RO) and abstract/ 
concrete (AC-CE) learning dimensions for the five functional groups. These results 
are consistent with the predictions above, with the exception of the finance group, 
whose scores are less active than predicted and thus fall between the assimilative and the 
129
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
 convergent quadrants. The LSI clearly differentiates the learning styles that characterize 
managers with different jobs in a single company.
Further evidence for the proposed relationship between job demands and learning 
style comes from the medical profession. Plovnick (1974, 1975) studied the relation-
ship between learning style and the job specialty choices of senior medical students. He 
hypothesized that academic jobs stressing research and teaching would attract assimi-
lators more than other learning-style types, and practice-oriented specialties requir-
ing frequent patient interaction would attract the more active types. In addition, he 
expected that subspecialty practices (such as cardiology), having a more “scientific” ori-
entation, would attract convergers more, whereas practices in family medicine or pri-
mary care involving more concern for the socioemotional aspects of patient care would 
attract accommodators more. Psychiatry was expected to attract divergers, because of 
its humanistic orientation and because of the more reserved, reflective nature of the

borne out.2
Sims (1981), in his study of job role demands in the social-work and engineering 
professions, found that social-work administrators were primarily accommodative 
in their learning style, whereas those in direct service had divergent learning styles.

2.  A follow-up study by Wunderlich and Gjerde (1978) failed to replicate these findings with active 
 medical practitioners. This may be due to a difference in data analysis procedures between the two 
studies. Plovnick created types by dividing AE-RO and AC-CE scores at the sample median, whereas 
Wunderlich and Gjerde used the zero point on the scales to create types.

Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
However, he found no differences among the three major job roles of professional 
engineers—bench engineer, technical manager, and general manager—even though 
he did identify significant differences in the actual learning-style demands of these 
three job roles.
Adaptive Competencies
The fifth most specific and immediate level of forces that shapes learning style is the 
 specific task or problem the person is currently working on. Each task we face requires 
a corresponding set of skills for effective performance. The effective matching of task 
demands and personal skills results in an adaptive competence. The concept of  competence 
represents a new approach to the improvement of performance by matching persons with 
jobs. The previous approach, that of measurement and selection of personnel by general-
ized aptitudes has proved a dismal failure in spite of heroic efforts to make it succeed (see 
Tyler, 1978, Chapter 6 for a review). The basic problem of the  aptitude-testing approach 
was that aptitudes were too generalized and thus did not relate to the specific tasks in a 
given job, producing low correlations between the aptitude measure and performance. 
In addition, the aptitude and task measures often were not commensurate; that is, they 
did not measure the person and the task demand in the same terms. The competency-
assessment approach focuses on the person’s repertoire of skills as they relate to the 
specific demands of a job.
We have conceived of the elementary learning styles as generic adaptive competen-
cies; that is, as higher-level learning heuristics that facilitate the development of a 
generic class of more specific skills that are required for effective performance on 
different tasks (see Chapter 6, p. 216). To study the relations between learning styles 
as generic adaptive competencies and the specific competencies associated with 
each of the four styles, the self-rated competencies of professional engineers and 
social workers were correlated with LSI AC-CE and AE-RO scales. Although this 
self-rating methodology is of limited usefulness in assessing with great accuracy a 
person’s level of competence in a given situation, it can be used to assess the patterns 
of interrelationship among competencies, which was the objective of this research 
study. The correlations between LSI scores and competence self-ratings were plot-
ted on the two-dimensional learning space (see  Figure 4.8). For example, the skill 
of “being personally involved” correlated −.25 with AC-CE and +.10 with AE-RO, 
placing it in the accommodative quadrant of the learning-style space. As a result of 
this study, the list of competencies was revised and expanded and a second study 
was conducted with a sample of social-work and engineering graduates (see Figure 
4.9). These data were subjected to further factor analysis and refinement, resulting in 
what can be called a “competency circle” describing specific competencies arranged

in a two-dimensional space by their association with the generic adaptive compe-
tence of learning style (see Figure 4.10).
The accommodative learning style encompasses a set of competencies that can best be 
termed acting skills: committing oneself to objectives, seeking and exploiting opportuni-
ties, influencing and leading others, being personally involved, and dealing with people. 
The divergent learning style is associated with valuing skills: being sensitive to people’s 
feelings and to values, listening with an open mind, gathering information, and imagining 
implications of ambiguous situations. Assimilation is related to thinking competencies: 
organizing information, building conceptual models, testing theories and ideas, designing 
experiments, and analyzing quantitative data. The convergent learning style is associated 
with decision skills: creating new ways of thinking and doing, experimenting with new 
ideas, choosing the best solution to problems, setting goals, and making decisions. Since 
these adaptive competencies are defined as congruences between personal skills and task 
demands, it seems reasonable to conclude that tasks requiring given specific skills will 
to some degree influence the expression of the learning style associated with those skills.

Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
Summary and Conclusion
This chapter has described individual differences in learning by introducing the concept 
of learning styles. Learning styles are conceived not as fixed personality traits but as 
possibility-processing structures resulting from unique individual programming of the 
basic but flexible structure of human learning. These possibility-processing structures are 
best thought of as adaptive states or orientations that achieve stability through consistent 
patterns of transaction with the world; for example, my active orientation helps me per-
form well in active tasks, and since I am rewarded for this performance, I choose more 
active tasks, which further improves my active skills, and so on.
We have examined five levels at which these transactions between people and the world 
around them shape the basic learning styles—accommodation, divergence, assimilation, 
and convergence. For example, my own learning style at this moment is shaped by my 
personality disposition toward introversion and feeling, my undergraduate specializations 
in psychology, philosophy, and religion, my professional academic career commitment, 
the demands of my current job as a professor, and the specific task I am working on now—
writing this book. Thus, my learning style is clearly reflective and, at the moment, tipped 
toward assimilation, although other tasks in my professional role, such as teaching and 
counseling students, may shift me toward divergence. The forces that shape learning 
styles at these five levels are summarized in Figure 4.11. At one extreme there are those 
basic past experiences and habits of thought and action, our basic personality orientation 
and education, that exert a moderate but pervasive influence on our behavior in nearly 
all situations. At the other end of the continuum are those increasingly specific environ-
mental demands stemming from our career choice, our current job, and the specific tasks 
that face us. These forces exert a somewhat stronger but more situation-specific influence 
on the learning style we adopt.
When learning style is viewed from the two-dimensional perspective proposed here, 
we can represent the current state of a person’s learning style as a single point on the 
abstract/concrete and active/reflective learning space. The position of this point—for 
example, in the center of the grid or at one of the extreme corners—is determined by the 
summative influence of the forces described above. But this representation summarizes 
only qualitative differences in elementary learning orientations. To fully appreciate a 
person’s approach to learning, we need to understand his or her position on a third 
dimension, that of development. An explanation of this dimension is yet to come, in 
Chapter 6. But before describing the experiential learning theory of development, we 
turn first (in Chapter 5) to an examination of the nature of knowledge and how it is cre-
ated by learning from experience, since individual approaches to learning and develop-
ment, as we have seen, are determined by one’s transactions with the various systems of 
social knowledge.

Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
Update and Reflections
Individuality, the Self, and Learning Style
“For it happens to be an inborn and imperative need of all men to regard 
the self as a unit. However often and however grievously this illusion is 
shattered, it always mends again. The judge who sits over the murderer 
and looks into his face, and at one moment renders all the emotions 
and potentialities and possibilities of the murderer in his own soul and 
hears the murderer’s voice as his own is at the next moment one and 
indivisible as the judge, and scuttles back into the shell of his cultivated 
self and does his duty and condemns the murderer to death. . . . In 
reality, however, every ego, so far from being a unity, is in the highest 
degree a manifold world, a constellated heaven, a chaos of forms, of 
states and stages, of inheritances and potentialities. It appears to be a 
necessity as imperative as eating and breathing for everyone to be forced 
to regard this chaos as unity and to speak of his ego as though it were a 
one-fold and clearly detached phenomenon. Even the best of us share  
the delusion.”
—Herman Hesse Steppenwolf
“At each intersection of Indra’s Net is a light-reflecting jewel and each 
jewel contains another net, ad infinitum. The jewel at each intersection 
exists only as a reflection of all the others and therefore has no  
self-nature. Yet it also exists as a separate entity to sustain the others. 
Each and all exist only in their mutuality.”
—The metaphor of Indra’s Net from the Avatamsaka Sutra
Many years ago Kluckholm and Murray described three different kinds of order in 
human behavior, “Every person is like every other person in some ways. Every person is 
like some other person in some ways. Every person is like no other person in some ways.” 
(1948, p. 1). Individuality is a pivotal concept in experiential learning theory. Learning 
style is one aspect of individuality, one of an almost infinite number of ways that individ-
uals differ. In experiential learning theory, learning style is not a fixed trait but a dynamic 
characteristic describing how the self processes experience. Every individual is a center 
138 
Experiential Learning
of experiencing that is grasped and transformed to create a continuity of experience that 
among other things includes a unique sense of self.
Western and Eastern Views of the Self
In Western psychology there is a long standing controversy about whether there is a uni-
tary self. Early research (Block, 1961) saw a unified consistent self as indicative of a strong 
ego, and lack of self consistency as a sign of neurosis. More contemporary research has 
been influenced by post-modern social constructionism and tends to show that complex 
self differentiation allows flexibility and is thus a healthy “buffer” to the complex demands 
of modern life (Linville, 1982, 1985, 1987). Akrivou (2009) used Linville’s measure of self 
complexity and two measures of the higher stages of adult development (described in 
Chapter 6 Update and Reflections), namely self-ideal congruence and self-integrating 
process. She found that self-complexity was positively related to both of these measures 
of self integration; indicating that self-complexity was important for a person to achieve 
a higher order synthesis of identity, as manifested in the constructivist notion of self-
integration described in experiential learning theory. Development from specialization 
to integration is the progressive and continuous acquisition of subtler distinctions among 
self categories and concepts and their ordering into hierarchical systems of meaning.
Lynch and Ryan (2014) studied self consistency and authenticity as predictors of well-
being in three cultures, the United States, China, and Russia. Both were related to well-
being in all three countries. Authenticity, defined as “being true to yourself” and being 
genuine and congruent with one’s values and beliefs, was a more powerful predictor of 
well-being than consistency.
Recent research by Kahneman and Riis calls into question the methodology of this line 
of research. Their research on happiness and well-being of life found differences between 
measurements based on what they called the experiencing self and the remembered/
thinking self. The work cited above as well as most psychological research on the self is 
based on a remembered, thinking self where research participants complete Likert scale 
ratings or other descriptions of how they see themselves. This abstract conception of 
self is contrasted with real time experience in the moment: “An individual’s life could be 
described—at impractical length—as a string of moments. A common estimate is that 
each of these moments of psychological present may last up to 3 seconds, suggesting that 
people experience some 20,000 moments in a waking day, and upwards of 500 million 
moments in a 70-year life. Each moment can be given a rich multidimensional descrip-
tion. . . . What happens to these moments? The answer is straightforward: With very few 
exceptions, they simply disappear. The experiencing self that lives each of these moments 
barely has time to exist. . . . Unlike the experiencing self, the remembering self is relatively 
stable and permanent. It is a basic fact of the human condition that memories are what 
we get to keep from our experience, and the only perspective we can adopt as we think 
139
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
about our lives is that of the remembering self” (2005, pp. 285–286). The authors go on to 
say that these memories of experience are flawed by a number of cognitive illusions and 
are often wrong. For example, a study of vacations found substantial difference between 
recalled enjoyment and actual experienced enjoyment. It was recalled enjoyment that 
predicted desire to repeat the vacation. In another study, people predict that they are 
happier on their birthday, but actual experience of happiness is the same as other days.
Some Eastern conceptions of the self see it as an illusion spawned by the seeming conti-
nuity of discrete momentary experiences. We referred earlier, in the Chapter 2 Update 
and Reflections, to the Theraveda Buddhist image of moment consciousness as a string 
of pearls. In Western views, the string is seen as the continuous self, but not in Bud-
dhism. As with the experiencing self described above, experience is described as a string 
of discontinuous experiential moments which are estimated to be much shorter than 3 
seconds, around 1/500th to 1/75th of a second. In each of these moments of experience, 
there is discernment, recognition of an object which is accompanied by the dualistic 
awareness of a self attending to the object.
“Between moments of experience of self are gaps in which there is no sense of self or 
separateness from what is being experienced. . . . By this they meant a dharma which is 
not conditioned at all by previous patterns. It enters freely and brings with it a sense of 
freedom from habitual thought. . . . This unconditioned dharma is called nirvana, liter-
ally ‘extinction.’ This does not mean extinction of all experience, but only of the grasping 
onto the belief that one is a permanent self” (Hayward, 1998, p. 619).
Continuity of self or the ‘stream of consciousness’ is attributed to the coarseness of ordinary 
attention. With meditation practice it is possible to sharpen attention to become aware of 
the nirvana background. “Egolessness is not some state of mind to be attained as some-
thing foreign to one’s present state, nor is it a ‘higher state of being’. . . . It is a  fundamental, 
 ever-present aspect of one’s ordinary being, which is covered up due to ignorance and bewil-
derment, believing in ego’s continuity, and which can therefore be uncovered by knowledge 
and insight.” (1998, p. 622) . . . “Egolessness is not a state in which there is no sense of self 
at all. Rather it is a state in which the self is perceived not as a solid permanent thing . . . but 
as a constant momentary flashing into existence out of a boundless background. Gradual 
identification with the background, rather than with the illusion of a permanent self, brings 
a sense of harmony, clarity, wisdom and energy to one’s life” (1998, p. 625).
Experiential Learning and the Self
The self in experiential learning theory is dynamic and developmental, moving toward a 
coherent identity and integrity. The self is a dynamic continuous process of learning from 
experience that takes a unique developmental path for every individual, motivated by a 
holistic organismic drive for actualization. Carl Rogers describes his theoretical system this 
way: “It should be noted that this basic actualizing tendency is the only motive which is 
140 
Experiential Learning
postulated in this theoretical system . . . it is the organism as a whole, and only the organ-
ism as a whole, which exhibits this tendency. There are no homunculi, no other sources 
of energy or action in the system. The self, for example, is an important construct in our 
theory, but the self does not ‘do’ anything. It is only one expression of the general tendency 
of the organism to behave in those ways which maintain and enhance itself” (1959, p. 196).
Self individuality is created through the on–going spiraling of the learning cycle in trans-
action with the social and relational context. Each mode of the learning cycle forms a 
facet of the self moving toward integration (see Figure 4.12). Everyone develops a unique 
configuration of these selves through a process of accentuation (Chapter 7, pp. 242–244).
Kahneman’s identification of the experiencing and the remembered/thinking self are 
consistent with the dual knowledge concept of experiential learning theory (Chapter 3, 
pp. 69–77). The experiencing self is based on direct, present-oriented, concrete experi-
ence composed of the discrete brief moments of experiences and the self-less spaces 
between: the nirvana background of Buddhist thought. I see a similarity between James’ 
concept of pure experience and the nirvana background. The moments of direct self 
experiencing are somewhat influenced by personal history, culture, and context as Dewey 
emphasized (see Chapter 2 Update and Reflections). The thinking self is constructed 
through memories of concrete experiences that have been given meaning through cogni-
tive interpretation. While the remembered self is inevitably a biased representation of the 
directly experienced self, it is nonetheless the basis on which we make most life choices

and decisions. The remembered self is constructed from numerous cases of episodic 
memory (Chapter 3 Update and Reflections). Mindful cycling through the learning cycle 
may increase the congruence between the thinking and experiencing self.
A number of experiential learning scholars, including Jack Mezirow (1990), Stephen 
Brookfield (1987), and David Boud (Boud, Keogh, and Walker, 1985), see the reflecting 
self as the major pathway to self integration and transformation in the integrating self. 
Others emphasize self integration through the acting self. Richard Boyatzis’ Intentional 
Change Theory (2008), Deci and Ryan’s Self-Determination Theory (1995, 2004), and 
the Self-Authorship Theory of Kegan (1994) and Baxter-Magolda (2007, 2008) all focus 
on agentic self-actualization. For Rogers (1961, 1964) and Gendlin (1962, 1978), the path 
to integration lies in the experiencing self. And for Kohlberg (1981, 1984, 1987), it is the 
thinking self that guides development toward integration.
Thus the self in experiential learning theory is seen as an ongoing process of special-
ized differentiation and integration through an executive meta-self; the consistency and 
unity of which varies across individuals and their life span. The meta-self is created in 
Mead’s (1934) process of self generation as a response to a “generalized other” created 
in moments of experiencing with others in one’s life. The integrating process itself is an 
internal conversation with the “I” speaking to the “Me.” Power (2007), in a special issue 
of the Journal of Clinical Psychology on the multiplicity of self, quotes the Portuguese 
writer Fernando Pessoa: “ My soul is a hidden orchestra; I know not what instruments, 
what fiddle strings and harps, drums and tambours I sound and clash inside myself. All 
I hear is the symphony” (2007, p. 187). He uses this example of the self as a symphony 
orchestra to describe this dynamic differentiation and integration, “when the different 
parts of the orchestra play in harmony with each other, then the overall experience is 
of an integrated whole. . . . Indeed, this same experience of integration can be apparent 
when one or more sections of the orchestra is silent or absent. Alternatively, there can 
be a discordant sense of disintegration if the different orchestral parts do not coordinate 
with each other, for example if each part were to play a different tune” (2007, p. 188).
Learning Style
I created the Learning Style Inventory to describe the unique ways that individual selves 
“process possibilities” (to use Tyler’s term) (see Chapter 4, pp. 99–100) by spiraling through 
the learning cycle based on their preference for the four different learning modes—CE, 
RO, AC, and AE. It is therefore focused on that aspect of individuality related to how indi-
viduals learn from experience. As a dynamic holistic concept of style, it describes human 
uniqueness by examining normative descriptions of personal style across individuals and an 
idiographic profiling within an individual of the different styles within the holistic model.
The original Learning Style Inventory (LSI 1) was created in 1969 as part of a MIT cur-
riculum development project that resulted in the first management textbook based on 
142 
Experiential Learning
experiential learning (Kolb, Rubin, and McIntyre, 1971). There have been six versions 
of the Learning Style Inventory published over the last 45 years. Through this time, 
attempts have been made to openly share information about the inventory, its scoring,  
and technical characteristics with other interested researchers. The results of their 
research have been instrumental in the continuous improvement of the inventory.
I coined the term learning style to describe these individual differences; differentiating 
them from the cognitive style research that was popular at the time. As described in 
Chapter 4 (Chapter 4, pp. 98–100), I sought to distinguish styles of learning from experi-
ence not as fixed traits, but as dynamic states arising in an on–going process of learning. 
For this reason, the format of the LSI is a forced choice format that asks individuals to 
rank their relative choice preferences among the four modes of the learning cycle. This is 
in contrast the more common normative or free choice format, such as the widely used 
Likert scale, that rates absolute preferences on independent dimensions.
The forced choice format of the LSI was dictated by the theory of experiential learning 
and by the primary purpose of the instrument. Experiential learning theory is a holistic, 
dynamic, and dialectic theory of learning. Because it is holistic, the four modes that com-
prise the experiential learning cycle—CE, RO, AC, and AE—are conceived as interde-
pendent. Learning involves resolving the creative tension among these learning modes in 
response to the specific learning situation. Since the two learning dimensions—AC-CE 
and AE-RO—are related dialectically, the choice of one pole involves not choosing the 
opposite pole. Therefore, because experiential learning theory postulates that learning in 
life situations requires the resolution of conflicts among interdependent learning modes, 
to be ecologically valid the learning style assessment process should require a similar 
process of conflict resolution in the choice of one’s preferred learning approach. The 
LSI is not a criterion-referenced test and is not intended for use to predict behavior for 
purposes of selection, placement, job assignment, or selective treatment. This includes 
not using the instrument to assign learners to different educational treatments, a process 
sometimes referred to as “tracking.” Such categorizations based on a single test score 
amount to stereo-typing that runs counter to the philosophy of experiential learning that 
emphasizes individual uniqueness. “When it is used in the simple, straightforward, and 
open way intended, the LSI usually provides a valuable self-examination and discussion 
that recognizes the uniqueness, complexity, and variability in individual approaches to 
learning. The danger lies in the reification of learning styles into fixed traits, such that 
learning styles become stereotypes used to pigeonhole individuals and their behavior” 
(Kolb, 1981a, pp. 290–291).
The most relevant information for the learner is about intra-individual differences, his 
or her relative preference for the four learning modes, not inter-individual comparisons. 
Ranking relative preferences among the four modes in a forced choice format is the 
most direct way to provide this information. While individuals who take the inventory 
sometimes report difficulty in making these ranking choices; nonetheless, they report 
143
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
that the feedback they get from the LSI gives them more insight than has been the case 
when we use a normative Likert rating scale version. This is because the social desirability 
response bias in the rating scales fails to define a clear learning style; that is, they say they 
prefer all learning modes. This is supported by Harland’s (2002) finding that feedback 
from a forced choice test format was perceived as more accurate, valuable, and useful 
than feedback from a normative version.
The adoption of the forced choice method for the LSI has at times placed it in the center 
of an ongoing debate in the research literature about the merits of forced choice instru-
ments and other issues. For a detailed analysis of these issues, see the Kolb Learning Style 
Inventory Guidebook (Kolb and Kolb, 2013a).
The Kolb Learning Style Inventory 4.0
The research reported in this chapter (Chapter 4 on individuality in learning) is based 
on the first version of the Kolb Learning Style Inventory (KLSI) (Kolb, LSI 1971, pp. 
1976a and b). The latest version, the Kolb Learning Style Inventory 4.0 (KLSI 4.0) (Kolb 
and Kolb, 2011), is the first major revision of the KLSI since 1999 and the third since 
the original Learning Style Inventory (LSI) was published in 1971. It is based on many 
years of research involving scholars around the world and data from many thousands 
of respondents. The KLSI 4.0 maintains the high scale reliability of the KLSI 3.1 while 
offering higher internal validity. Scores on the KLSI 4.0 are highly correlated with scores 
on the previous KLSI 3.1, thus maintaining the external validity that the instrument has 
shown over the years. Validity research on the KLSI since the publication of Experiential 
Learning is also reviewed in the Kolb Learning Style Inventory 4 Guidebook.
Data from empirical and clinical studies over the years have shown that these original four 
learning style types—Accommodating, Assimilating, Converging, and  Diverging—can 
be refined further into a nine-style typology that better defines the unique patterns of 
individual learning styles and reduces the confusions introduced by borderline cases in 
the old four-style typology (Eickmann, Kolb, and Kolb, 2004; Kolb and Kolb, 2005a&b; 
Boyatzis and Mainemelis, 2000). With feedback from users, we first began noticing a 
fifth “balancing” style describing users who scored at the center of the Learning Style 
grid. Later we discovered that individuals who scored near the grid boundary lines also 
had distinctive styles. For example, an “Experiencing” style was identified between the 
Accommodating and Diverging styles. Four of these style types emphasize one of the 
four learning modes—Experiencing (CE), Reflecting (RO), Thinking (AC), and Acting 
(AE) (Abbey, Hunt, and Weiser, 1985; Hunt, 1987). Four others represent style types 
that emphasize two learning modes, one from the grasping dimension and one from the 
transforming dimension of the experiential learning theory model—Imagining (CE and 
RO), Analyzing (AC and RO), Deciding (AC and AE), and Initiating (CE and AE). The 
final style type balances all four modes of the learning cycle—Balancing (CE, RO, AC, 
and AE) (Mainemelis, Boyatzis, and Kolb, 2002).
144 
Experiential Learning
The new KLSI 4.0 introduces these nine style types by moving from a 4-pixel to 9-pixel 
resolution of learning style types as described below. The learning style types can be 
systematically arranged on a two-dimensional learning space defined by Abstract 
 Conceptualization-Concrete Experience and Active Experimentation-Reflective Obser-
vation. This space, including a description of the distinguishing kite shape of each style, 
is depicted in Figure 4.13.

Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
The Initiating Style The Initiating style is characterized by the ability to initiate action 
in order to deal with experiences and situations. It involves active experimentation (AE) 
and concrete experience (CE).
The Experiencing Style The Experiencing style is characterized by the ability to find 
meaning from deep involvement in experience. It draws on concrete experience (CE) 
while balancing active experimentation (AE) and reflective observation (RO).
The Imagining Style The Imagining style is characterized by the ability to imagine 
possibilities by observing and reflecting on experiences. It combines the learning steps 
of concrete experience (CE) and reflective observation (RO).
The Reflecting Style The Reflecting style is characterized by the ability to connect expe-
rience and ideas through sustained reflection. It draws on reflective observation (RO) 
while balancing concrete experience (CE) and abstract conceptualization (AC).
The Analyzing Style The Analyzing style is characterized by the ability to integrate and 
systematize ideas through reflection. It combines reflective observation (RO) and abstract 
conceptualization (AC).
The Thinking Style The Thinking style is characterized by the capacity for disciplined 
involvement in abstract and logical reasoning. It draws on abstract conceptualization 
(AC) while balancing active experimentation (AE) and reflective observation (RO).
The Deciding Style The Deciding style is characterized by the ability to use theories 
and models to decide on problem solutions and courses of action. It combines abstract 
conceptualization (AC) and active experimentation (AE).
The Acting Style The Acting style is characterized by a strong motivation for goal 
directed action that integrates people and tasks. It draws on active experimentation (AE) 
while balancing concrete experience (CE) and abstract conceptualization (AC).
The Balancing Style The Balancing style is characterized by the ability to adapt: weigh-
ing the pros and cons of acting versus reflecting and experiencing versus thinking. It 
balances concrete experience, abstract conceptualization, active experimentation, and 
reflective observation.
These nine KLSI 4.0 learning styles further define the experiential learning cycle by 
emphasizing four dialectic tensions in the learning process. In addition to the primary 
dialectics of Abstract Conceptualization/Concrete Experience and Active Experimenta-
tion/Reflective Observation, the combination dialectics of Assimilation/Accommoda-
tion and Converging/Diverging are also represented in an eight stage learning cycle with 
Balancing in the center. The formulas for calculating the continuous scores on these 
combination dialectics are reported in the Kolb Learning Style Inventory 4 Guidebook 
(Kolb and Kolb, 2013a).
146 
Experiential Learning
Thus, the Initiating style has a strong preference for active learning in context (Accom-
modation), while the Analyzing style has a strong preference for reflective conceptual 
learning (Assimilation). The concepts of assimilation and accommodation are central 
to Piaget’s (1952) definition of intelligence as the balance of adapting concepts to fit the 
external world (accommodation) and the process of fitting observations of the external 
world into existing concepts (assimilation). This measure was used in the validation of 
the Learning Flexibility Index (Sharma and Kolb, 2010; see Chapter 6) and has been 
used by other researchers in previous studies (Wierstra and de Jong, 2002; Allinson and 
Hayes, 1996).
The Imagining style has a strong preference for opening alternatives and perspectives on 
experience (Diverging), while the Deciding style has a strong preference for closing on 
the single best option for action (Converging). The concepts of converging and diverging 
originated in Guilford’s (1988) structure of intellect model as the central dialectic of the 
creative process. This dialectic concept has been used in research on experiential learning 
theory by Gemmell (2012) and Kolb (1983).
Some studies have used continuous balance scores for ACCE and AERO to assess bal-
anced learning style scores (Mainemelis, Boyatzis, and Kolb, 2002; Sharma and Kolb, 
2010). These variables compute the absolute values of the ACCE and AERO scores 
adjusted to center on the fiftieth percentile of the normative comparison group. 
 Figure 4.14 depicts this expanded learning cycle and illustrates how an individual’s par-
ticular style represents his or her preferred space in the cycle.
Learning Flexibility
Another important aspect of learning style is learning flexibility, the extent to which an 
individual adapts his or her learning style to the demands of the learning situation. As 
we have seen above, learning style is not a fixed personality trait but more like a habit of 
learning shaped by experience and choices. It can be an automatic, unconscious mode of 
adapting, or it can be consciously modified and changed. The stability of learning style 
arises from consistent patterns of transaction between individuals and learning situa-
tions in their life. This process is called accentuation—the way we learn about a new 
situation determines the range of choices and decisions we see, the choices and decisions 
we make influence the next situation we live through, and this situation further influ-
ences future choices. Learning styles are thus specialized modes of adaptation that are 
reinforced by the continuing choice of situations where a style is successful.
Since a specialized learning style represents an individual preference for only one or two 
of the four modes of the learning cycle, its effectiveness is limited to those learning situ-
ations that require these strengths. Learning flexibility indicates the development of a 
more holistic and sophisticated learning process. The learning style types described above 
portray how one prefers to learn in general. Many individuals feel that their learning style 
147
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
type accurately describes how they learn most of the time. They are consistent in their 
approach to learning. Others, however, report that they tend to change their learning 
approach depending on what they are learning or the situation they are in. They may say, 
for example, that they use one style in the classroom and another at home with their friends 
and family. These are flexible learners.
The KLSI 4.0 also includes an assessment of learning flexibility by integrating the 
Adaptive Style Inventory (ASI) into the instrument. Chapter 8 describes the creation 
of the ASI, which was designed to assess individuals’ level of integrative complexity 
as they progressed from the specialized to integrated stage of the experiential learn-
ing theory developmental model (see Figure 6.3). The instrument assessed adaptive 
 flexibility by measuring how individuals change their learning style in response to dif-
ferent situational demands. It was based on the theory that if people show systematic

variability in their response to different contextual learning demands, one could infer 
a higher level of integrative development because systematic variation would imply 
higher order decision rules or meta-cognitive processes for guiding behavior (Kolb 
and Kolb, 2009).
A number of researchers have found evidence to support the link between learning 
flexibility and integrative development. Early studies (reported in Chapter 8) found 
that ASI adaptive flexibility is positively related to higher levels of ego development on 
Loevinger’s sentence completion instrument (Kolb and Wolfe, 1981). Individuals with 
higher levels of adaptive flexibility perceived themselves to be more self-directed in their 
current life situation and to have greater flexibility. They had higher levels of differen-
tiation in their personal relationships, and they used more constructs to describe their 
life structure. In addition, they experienced less conflict and stress in their life despite 
experiencing their life to be more complex. Subsequent research on learning flexibility 
has replicated some of these findings. Perlmutter (1990) studied 51 medical professionals 
and found significant relationships between Loevinger’s ego development instrument 
and adaptive flexibility. Thompson (1999), in a sample of 50 professionals from various 
fields, found that self-directed learners had higher levels of adaptive flexibility than learn-
ers who were not self-directed.
Another study by Mainemelis, Boyatzis, and Kolb (2002) examined the relationship 
between learning style as measured by the Kolb Learning Style Inventory (Kolb, 1999, 
2005) and ASI adaptive flexibility. The study tested the hypothesis that learners with 
equal preferences for dialectically opposed learning modes would be better able to inte-
grate their learning preferences into a flexible learning process. The study proposed that 
a balanced learning style (as given by the absolute value for the dialectics of experiencing/
conceptualizing and acting/reflecting adjusted for population mean) would be related to 
learning flexibility. In other words, the more an individual is balanced on the concep-
tualizing/experiencing and acting/reflecting dialectics, the more he or she will exhibit 
learning flexibility. This was supported for the dialectic of conceptualizing/experiencing. 
No significant result was found for the dialectic of acting/reflecting. However, the study 
also found an equally strong relationship between learning flexibility and a preference 
for concreteness over abstraction, the KLSI AC-CE score.
Akrivou (2008) found a relationship between learning flexibility and integrative devel-
opment as measured by her Integrative Development Scale (IDS). She created this 
scale by identifying items that describe the integrative stage of adult development as 
defined in the works of Loevinger (1966, 1976, 1998), Rogers (1961), Perry (1970), 
Kegan (1982, 1994), and Kolb (1984, 1988, 1991). In her comprehensive review of ASI 
research, Bell (2005) reported other construct validity evidence but suggested a need 
for revision of the original instrument and the creation of new measures of adaptive 
flexibility.
149
Chapter 4 Individuality in Learning and the Concept of Learning Styles 
Sharma and Kolb (2010) modified the ASI to fit the format of the KLSI and created 
a Learning Flexibility Index (LFI) based on the Kendall’s W statistic. They showed 
construct validity for the LFI measure by testing six hypotheses about the place of the 
LFI in a nomological net. The LFI was negatively related to age and educational level. 
Women and those in concrete professions tended to be more flexible. Individuals with 
an assimilating learning style tended to be less flexible. The LFI was positively related 
to Akrivou’s Integrative Development Scale, replicating her earlier findings. Individu-
als who are men, older, highly educated, and specialists in abstract, paradigmatic fields 
were more assimilative in learning style and had less learning flexibility. The results 
suggest that it is the orientation toward abstraction and reflection characteristic of the 
assimilative learning style that leads to inflexibility. Since it is the assimilative style 
that is the most favored and most developed in formal education systems, one might 
ask if this abstract approach is producing the unintended negative consequence of 
learning inflexibility. Emphasis on conceptual learning at the expense of contextual 
learning may lead to dogmatic adherence to ideas without testing them in experience, 
what Whitehead called “the fallacy of misplaced concreteness.” Contextual learning 
approaches like experiential learning (Kolb, 1984) and situated learning (Lave and 
Wenger, 1991) may help education to nurture integrated learners who are as sensi-
tive to context as they are to abstract concepts. A related issue concerns the priority 
placed on specialized over integrative learning in education. Specialization in subject 
matter and the learning style most suited to learning it may well produce higher levels 
of specialized mastery. Mainemelis et al. (2002) found that specialized learning styles 
led to greater development of learning skills related to the specialization than did bal-
anced learning styles.
A study by Moon (2008) using the new KLSI 4.0 Learning Flexibility Index examined 
sales performance in financial services, finding that learning flexibility influenced sales 
success as measured by monthly volume of sales. Gemmell (2012) studied 172 technol-
ogy entrepreneurs who were founders/CEOs of their current company. He examined 
the relationship between their KLSI and LFI 4.0 scores and their company’s innovation 
and performance. Results shown in Figure 4.15 display a positive relationship between 
Active Experimentation (AE-RO) and experimentation, which in turn influenced inno-
vation and performance. Entrepreneurs with high learning flexibility were more likely 
to take longer to make key strategic decisions; however, in the process of doing so, they 
were more innovative. “Technology entrepreneurs who are flexible learners—in spite of 
the enormous environmental pressures—appear to achieve greater innovation by taking 
slightly longer to consider more alternatives, to reflect upon those alternatives and to 
ultimately converge to a solution and take action” (2012, p. 90).
Learning flexibility indicates the development of a more holistic and sophisticated learn-
ing process. Following Jung’s theory that adult development moves from a specialized 
150 
Experiential Learning
way of adapting toward a holistic integrated way, development in learning flexibility is 
seen as a move from specialization to integration. Integrated learning is a process involv-
ing a creative tension among the four learning modes that is responsive to contextual 
demands. Learning flexibility is the ability to use each of the four learning modes to move 
freely around the learning cycle and to modify one’s approach to learning based on the 
learning situation. Experiencing, reflecting, thinking, and acting each provide valuable 
perspectives on the learning task in a way that deepens and enriches knowledge.
This can be seen as traveling through each of the regions of the learning space in the 
process of learning. The flexibility to move from one learning mode to another in the 
learning cycle is important for effective learning. Learning flexibility can help us move 
in and out of the learning space regions, capitalizing on the strengths of each learning 
style. Learning flexibility broadens the learning comfort zone and allows us to operate 
comfortably and effectively in more regions of the learning space, promoting deep learn-
ing and development. In addition to providing a measure of how flexible one is in their 
approach to learning, the KLSI 4.0 also provides an indication of which learning space 
they move to in different learning contexts—their back–up learning styles. Figure 4.16 
shows the backup styles of Initiating and Balancing for an Experiencing type with a low 
flexibility score and the backup styles of Experiencing, Imagining, Balancing, Reflecting,

The Structure of Knowledge
Experience is not a veil that shuts off man from nature, it is a  
means of penetrating continually further into the heart of nature.
—John Dewey
N
o account of human learning could be considered complete without an exami-
nation of culturally accumulated knowledge, its nature and organization, and 
the processes whereby individual learners contribute to and partake of that 
knowledge. Individual learning styles are shaped by the structure of social knowledge 
and through individual creative acts; knowledge is formed by individuals. To understand 
learning fully, we must understand the nature and forms of human knowledge and the 
processes whereby this knowledge is created and recreated. Piaget, in the conclusion to 
his 1970 book, Genetic Epistemology, describes three approaches to learning and knowl-
edge creation and their relation to learning from experience:
These few examples may clarify why I consider the main problem of genetic 
epistemology to be the explanation of the construction of novelties in the devel-
opment of knowledge. From the empiricist point of view, a “discovery” is new 
for the person who makes it, but what is discovered was already in existence in 
external reality and there is therefore no construction of new realities. The nativ-
ist or apriorist maintains that the forms of knowledge are predetermined inside 
the subject and thus again, strictly speaking, there can be no novelty. By contrast, 
for the genetic epistemologist, knowledge results from continuous construction, 
since in each act of understanding, some degree of invention is involved; in 
development, the passage from one stage to the next is always characterized by 
the formation of new structures which did not exist before, either in the external 
world or in the subject’s mind. [Piaget, 1970a, p. 77]
The empiricist, apriorist (rationalist), and genetic-epistemology (interactionist) perspec-
tives on the acquisition of knowledge have defined epistemological debates in Western 
154 
Experiential Learning
philosophy since the classical Greek philosophers. In the seventeenth century came the 
first challenge to the dogma of religious and political authority. The unitary worldview of 
medieval scholasticism that had dominated the Christian world up until that time gave way 
to the development of rational and later, empirical concepts that made possible control and 
mastery of the material world. In the seventeenth century, knowledge was thought to be 
accessible to the mind alone through rational analysis and introspection. The rationalist 
philosophers—most notably Descartes, Spinoza, and Libnetz—posed the thesis that truth 
was to be discovered by use of the tools of logic and reason. Ideas were real and a priori to 
the empirical world. Since experiences were merely reflections of ideal forms, it was the 
ideal forms in the mind that gave meaning to experiences in the world. As Descartes put it:
[God] laid down these laws in nature just as a king lays down laws in his kingdom. 
There is no single one that we cannot understand if our minds turn to consider it. 
They are all inborn in our minds just as a king would imprint his laws on the hearts 
of his subjects if he had enough power to do so. [Cited in Frankfurt, 1977, p. 36]
The eighteenth century gave rise to the antithesis of rationalism—empiricism. According 
to the empiricist philosophers—Locke, Hobbes, and others—knowledge was to be found 
in the accumulated associations of our sense impressions of the world around us. The 
mind was a tabula rasa, recording these accumulated sense impressions but making no 
contribution of its own save its capacity to recognize “substance.” Truth was to be found 
in careful observation of the world, a notion that gave rise to a burgeoning of scientific 
investigation in the eighteenth century.
The nineteenth century saw a synthesis of the rationalist and empiricist positions in the 
critical idealism of Kant, the first of the interactionist epistemologists. For Kant, the mind 
possessed a priori equipment that enabled it to interpret experience—specifically, equip-
ment to locate forms in time and space and equipment to understand order and unifor-
mity. Thus, the laws of geometry and logic were considered to be beyond experience and 
essential for interpreting it. Truth in critical idealism was the product of the interaction 
between the mind’s forms and the material facts of sense experience.
Apprehension vs. Comprehension— 
A Dual-Knowledge Theory
This brief overview of the history of epistemological philosophy is perhaps sufficient to 
frame the contribution of experiential learning theory to the question of how knowl-
edge is acquired. A moment’s reflection on the experiential learning cycle (see Figure 
3.1) will suffice to illustrate the limitations of either the rationalist or the empiricist 
philosophies alone as an epistemological foundation for experiential learning. As we 
have seen in Chapter 3, experiential learning is based on a dual-knowledge theory: the 
empiricists’ concrete experience, grasping reality by the process of direct apprehension, 
and the  rationalists’ abstract conceptualization, grasping reality via the mediating process 
of abstract conceptualization. We are thus left with Piaget in the interactionist position.
155
Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
The interactionist epistemology of experiential learning theory, however, is different in 
some significant ways from the Piagetian interactionism of genetic epistemology. As has 
been suggested, Piaget’s interactionism is decidedly rationalist in spirit. Consider, for 
example, his explanation of how it is that mathematical formulations have consistently 
anticipated subsequent empirical findings:
This harmony between mathematics and physical reality cannot in positivist fash-
ion be written off as simply the correspondence of a language with the object it 
designates. . . . Rather it is a correspondence of human operations with those of 
object operators, a harmony, then, between this particular operator—the human 
being as body and mind—and the innumerable operators in nature—physical 
objects at their several levels. Here we have remarkable proof of that preestablished 
harmony among windowless monads of which Liebnitz dreamt. . . the most beauti-
ful example of biological adaptation that we know of. [Piaget, 1970a, pp. 40–41]
Substitute the processes of “biological adaptation” for “imprinting of his laws on our 
hearts,” and the “human operations” of the mind according to Piaget are nearly identical 
with the “inborn laws” of Descartes in the quote just cited. For both men, the powers of 
the mind are directly connected with the structure of reality. This rationalist orientation 
is reflected in the predominant position of action in Piaget’s theory about how knowledge 
is created. For him, sensations and perceptions are only the starting point of knowing; 
it is the organization and transformation of these sensations through action, most par-
ticularly internalized actions or thoughts, that creates knowledge. Knowledge then, for 
Piaget, is the progressive internalization of the action transformations through which we 
construct reality—a decidedly rationalist interactionism in which sensation (or knowing 
by apprehension) is secondary.
The interactionism of experiential learning theory places knowing by apprehension on 
an equal footing with knowing by comprehension, resulting in a stronger interaction-
ist position, really a transactionalism, in which knowledge emerges from the dialectic 
relationship between the two forms of knowing.1 This dialectic relationship is not the 
Kantian dialectic, in which thesis and antithesis stand only in logical contradiction, but 
the Hegelian dialectic, in which contradictions and conflicts are borne out of both logic 
and emotion in a thesis and antithesis of mutually antagonistic convictions.
1.  We focus in this chapter on the prehension dimension of apprehension and comprehension rather 
than the transformation dimension of intention and extension, because the prehension dimension 
describes the current state of our knowledge of the world—the content of knowledge, if you will—
whereas the transformation dimension describes the rates or processes by which that knowledge is 
changed. Although both content and process are legitimate aspects of structure, it is the content of 
knowledge and its form that have been the primary concern of epistemology, Piaget’s emphasis on 
behavioral  transformation notwithstanding. This is in a sense a convenience of exposition, since 
 enduring effects of transformation processes will be represented in the content of knowledge just as the 
rate of water  flowing into a tub is reflected in the level of water in the tub.
156 
Experiential Learning
To better understand the nature of this dialectic, let us examine the nature of the two 
knowing processes whose opposition fuels it. To begin with, knowing by apprehension is 
here-and-now. It exists only in a continuously unfolding present movement of apparently 
limitless depth wherein events are related via synchronicity—that is, a patterned inter-
relationship in the moment (compare Jung, 1960). It is thus timeless—at once instanta-
neous and eternal, the dynamic form of perceiving that Werner calls physiognomic (see 
Chapter 6, p. 204). Comprehension, on the other hand, is by its very nature a record of 
the past that seeks to define the future; the concept of linear time is perhaps its most 
fundamental foundation, underlying all concept of causality. As Hume pointed out, the 
mind cannot learn causal connections between events by experience alone (apprehen-
sion). All we learn through apprehension is that event B follows event A. There is nothing 
in the sense impression to indicate that A causes B. This judgment of causality is based 
on inferences from our comprehension of A and B.
The interplay between these two forms of knowing in the creation of knowledge is illus-
trated in what has been a difficult circular-argument problem in physics—the fact that 
speed is defined by using time and time is measured by speed. In classical mechanics, 
speed and time are coequal, since speed is defined as the relation between traveled space 
and duration. In relativistic mechanics, however, speed is more elementary, since it has 
a maximum velocity (the speed of light). This formulation led Einstein to ask Piaget, 
when they met in 1928, to investigate from the psychological viewpoint questions as 
to whether there was a sense of speed that was independent of time and that was more 
fundamental (acquired earlier). What Piaget and his associates found (Piaget, 1971) was 
that speed is the more basic notion, based on perception (apprehension), whereas time 
is a more inferential, complex construct (based on comprehension). Their experiments 
involved asking children to describe a moving object that passed behind nine vertical 
bars. Seventy to 80 percent of the subjects reported movement acceleration when the 
object passed behind the bars. Piaget’s conclusion was that following the moving object 
with one’s eyes was handicapped in the barred sections by momentary fixations on the 
bars, causing an impression of greater speed in the moving object. The apprehension of 
speed thus seems to be based on the muscular effort expended in attending to a moving 
object. The comprehension of time, however, occurs later developmentally and is much 
more complex. The apparent circularity of space/time equations in physics therefore 
appears to be psychologically rooted in the dialectic relationships of knowing speed by 
apprehension and time by comprehension.
A second difference between knowing by apprehension and knowing by comprehen-
sion is that apprehension is a registrative process transformed intentionally and exten-
sionally by appreciation, whereas comprehension is an interpretive process transformed 
 intentionally and extensionally by criticism. Michael Polanyi describes this difference in 
his comparison of articulate form (comprehension-based knowledge) and tacit knowl-
edge (based on apprehension):
157
Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
Where there is criticism, what is being criticized is, every time, the assertion 
of an articulate form. . . . The process of logical inference is the strictest form 
of human thought, and it can be subjected to severe criticism by going over it 
stepwise any number of times. Factual assertations and denotations can also 
be examined critically, although their testing cannot be formalized to the same 
extent.
In this sense just specified, tacit knowing cannot be critical . . . systematic forms 
of criticism can be applied only to articulate forms which you can try out afresh 
again and again. We should not apply, therefore, the terms critical or uncritical to 
any process of tacit thought by itself any more than we would speak of the criti-
cal or uncritical performance of a high jump or a dance. Tacit acts are judged by 
other standards and are to be regarded accordingly as a-critical. [Polanyi, 1958, 
p. 264]
The enduring nature of the articulate forms of comprehensive knowledge makes it pos-
sible to analyze, criticize, and rearrange these forms in different times and contexts. It is 
through such critical activity that the network of comprehensive knowledge is refined, 
elaborated on, and integrated. Any attempt to be critical of knowledge gained through 
apprehension, however, only destroys that knowledge. Criticism requires a reflective, 
analytic, objective posture that distances one from here-and-now experience; the here-
and-now experience in fact becomes criticizing, replacing the previous immediate appre-
hension. Since I am an avid golfer, this fact has been illustrated in my experience many 
times. In approaching a green to putt the ball, I note the distance of the ball from the hole, 
the slope of the green, the length and bend of the grass, how wet or dry it is, and other 
relevant factors. I attempt to attend to these factors without analyzing them, for when my 
mind is dominated by an analytic formula for hitting the ball (for instance, hit it harder 
because it’s wet), the putt invariably goes awry. What seems to work better is an apprecia-
tion of the total situation (the situation being defined by my previous comprehension of 
relevant aspects to attend to) in which I, the putter, ball, green, and hole are experienced 
holistically (no pun intended; compare Polanyi, 1966, pp. 18–19).
Much can be said about the process and method of criticism; indeed, most scholarly 
method is based on it. The process of appreciation is less recognized and understood. 
Thus, it is worth describing in some detail the character of appreciation. First, appre-
ciation is intimately associated with perceptual attention processes. Appreciation is 
largely the process of attending to and being interested in aspects of one’s experience. 
We notice only those aspects of reality that interest us and thereby “capture our atten-
tion.” Interest is the basic fact of mental life and the most elementary act of valuing. It is 
the selector of our experience. Appreciation involves attending to and being interested 
in our apprehensions of the world around us. Such attention deepens and extends the 
apprehended experience. Vickers, along with Zajonc (see Chapter 3), suggests that such 
158 
Experiential Learning
appreciative apprehensions precede judgments of fact; in other words, that preferences 
preceded inferences:
For even that basic discriminatory judgment “this” is a “that” is no mere find-
ing of fact, it is a decision to assimilate some object of attention, carved out of 
the tissue of all that is available to some category to which we have learned, 
rightly or wrongly, that it is convenient to assimilate such things. [Vickers, 
1968, pp. 139–140]
A second characteristic of appreciation, already alluded to, is that it is a process of valu-
ing. Appreciation of an apprehended moment is a judgment of both value and fact:
Appreciative behavior involves making judgments of value no less than judgments 
of reality. . . . Interests and standards . . . are systematically organized, a value system, 
distinguishable from the reality system yet inseparable from it. For facts are relevant 
only by reference to some judgment of value and judgments of value are mean-
ingful only in regard to some configuration of fact. Hence the need for a word to 
embrace the two, for which I propose the word appreciation, a word not yet appro-
priated by science which in its ordinary use (as in “appreciation of a situation”) 
implies a combined judgment of value and fact. [Vickers, 1968, pp. 164–198]
Appreciation of apprehended reality is the source of values. Most mature value judgments 
are combinations of value and fact. Yet it is the affective core of values that fuel them, 
giving values the power to select and direct behavior.
Finally, appreciation is a process of affirmation. Unlike criticism, which is based on skepti-
cism and doubt (compare Polanyi, 1958, pp. 269ff.), appreciation is based on belief, trust, 
and conviction. To appreciate apprehended reality is to embrace it. And from this affirma-
tive embrace flows a deeper fullness and richness of experience. This act of affirmation 
forms the foundation from which critical comprehension can develop. In Polanyi’s words:
We must now recognize belief once more as the source of all knowledge. Tacit 
assent and intellectual passions, the sharing of an idiom and of a cultural heri-
tage, affiliation to a like-minded community; such are the impulses which shape 
our vision of the nature of things on which we rely for our mastery of things. No 
intelligence, however critical or original, can operate outside such a fiduciary 
framework. [Polanyi, 1958, p. 266]
Appreciative apprehension and critical comprehension are thus fundamentally different 
processes of knowing. Appreciation of immediate experience is an act of attention, valu-
ing, and affirmation, whereas critical comprehension of symbols is based on objectivity 
(which involves a priori control of attention, as in double-blind controlled experiments), 
dispassionate analysis, and skepticism. As we will see, knowledge and truth result not 
from the preeminence of one of these knowing modes over the other but from the intense 
coequal confrontation of both modes.
159
Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
A third difference between knowing by apprehension and by comprehension is 
perhaps the most critical for our understanding of the nature of knowledge in its 
relationship to learning from experience. Apprehension of experience is a personal 
subjective process that cannot be known by others except by the communication 
to them of the comprehensions that we use to describe our immediate experience. 
Comprehension, on the other hand, is an objective social process, a tool of culture, 
as Engels would call it. From this it follows that there are two kinds of knowledge: 
personal knowledge, the combination of my direct apprehensions of experience and 
the socially acquired comprehensions I use to explain this experience and guide my 
actions; and social knowledge, the independent, socially, and culturally transmitted 
network of words, symbols, and images that is based solely on comprehension. The 
latter, as Dewey noted, is the civilized objective accumulation of the individual per-
son’s subjective life experience.
It is commonly assumed that what we are calling social knowledge stands alone from 
the personal experience of the user. When we think of knowledge, we think of books, 
computer programs, diagrams, and the like, organized into a coherent system or library. 
Social knowledge, however, cannot exist independently of the knower but must be con-
tinuously recreated in the knower’s personal experience, whether that experience be 
through concrete interaction with the physical and social world or through the media of 
symbols and language. With symbols and words in particular, we are often led into the 
illusion that knowledge exists independently in the written work or mathematical nota-
tion. But to understand these words and symbols requires a knower who understands and 
employs a transformational process in order to yield personal knowledge and meaning. 
If, for example, I read that a “black hole” in astronomy is like a gigantic spiral of water 
draining from a bathtub, I can create for myself some knowledge of what a black hole is 
like (such as the force of gravity drawing things into it) based on my concrete experiences 
in the bath. This, however, is quite a different knowledge of black holes from that of the 
scientists who understand the special theory of relativity, the idea that gravity curves 
space, and so on. Personal knowledge is thus the result of the transaction between the 
form or structure of its external representational and transformational grammar (social 
knowledge, such as the bathtub image or the formal theory of relativity) and the internal 
representational and transformation processes that the person has developed in his or 
her personal knowledge system.
The Dialectics of Apprehension and Comprehension
Thoughts without content are empty
Intuitions without concepts are blind.
—Immanuel Kant
160 
Experiential Learning
The dynamic relation between apprehension and comprehension lies at the core of 
knowledge creation. The mind, to use Sir Charles Sharrington’s famous phrase, is “an 
enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a 
meaningful pattern though never an abiding one. . . .” Normal human consciousness is 
a combination of two modes of grasping experiences, forming a continuous experiential 
fabric, the warp of which represents apprehended experiences woven tightly by the weft 
of comprehended representations. Just as the patterns in a fabric are governed by the 
interrelations among warp and weft, so too, personal knowledge is shaped by the inter-
relations between apprehension and comprehension. The essence of the interrelationship 
is expressed in Kant’s analysis of their interdependence: Apprehensions are the source of 
validation for comprehensions (“thoughts without content are empty”), and comprehen-
sions are the source of guidance in the selection of apprehensions (“intuitions without 
concepts are blind”).
Immediate apprehended experience is the ultimate source of the validity of comprehen-
sions in both fact and value. The factual basis of a comprehension is ultimately judged in 
terms of its connection with sense experience. Its value is similarly judged ultimately by 
its immediate affective utility. Albert Einstein describes the relation between apprehen-
sion and comprehension thus:
For me it is not dubious that our thinking goes on for the most part without use 
of signs (words) and beyond that to a considerable degree unconsciously. For 
how otherwise should it happen that sometimes we “wonder” quite spontane-
ously about some experience? This “wondering” seems to occur when an experi-
ence comes into conflict with a world of concepts which is already sufficiently 
fixed in us. Whenever such a conflict is experienced hard and intensively, it 
reacts back upon our thought world in a decisive way. The development of this 
thought world is in a certain sense a continuous flight from “wonder.” . . .
I see on the one side the totality of sense experiences and, on the other, the 
totality of the concepts and propositions which are laid down in books. The 
relations between the concepts and propositions among themselves and each 
other are of a logical nature, and the business of logical thinking is strictly lim-
ited to the achievement of the connection between concepts and propositions 
among each other according to firmly laid down rules which are the concern 
of logic. The concepts and propositions get “meaning,” viz. “content,” only 
through their connection with sense-experiences. The connection of the latter 
with the former is purely intuitive, not itself of a logical nature. The degree 
of certainty with which this relation, viz. intuitive connection, can be under-
taken, and nothing else differentiates empty phantasy from scientific “truth.” 
[Schilpp, 1949]

Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
More directly, the physicist David Bohm says, “All knowledge is a structure of abstrac-
tions, the ultimate test of the validity of which is, however, in the process of coming into 
contact with the world that takes place in immediate perception” (1965, p. 220).
Comprehensions, on the other hand, guide our choices of experiences and direct our 
attention to those aspects of apprehended experience to be considered relevant. Com-
prehension is more than a secondary process of representing selected aspects of appre-
hended reality. The process of critical comprehension is capable of selecting and reshaping 
apprehended experience in ways that are more powerful and profound. The power of 
comprehension has led to the discovery of ever-new ways of seeing the world, the very 
connection between mind and physical reality that Piaget noted earlier (compare Dewey, 
1958, pp. 67–68). Dewey describes the powers of comprehension over the immediacy of 
apprehension in his reference to William James:
Genuine science is impossible as long as the object esteemed for its own intrin-
sic qualities is taken as the object of knowledge. Its completeness, its immanent 
meaning, defeats its use as indicating and implying.
Said William James, “Many were the ideal prototypes of rational order: teleo-
logical and esthetic ties between things . . . as well as logical and mathemati-
cal relations. The most promising of these things at first were of course the 
richer ones, the more sentimental ones. The baldest and least promising were 
mathematical ones; but the history of the latter’s application is a history of 
steadily advancing successes, while that of the sentimentally richer ones is 
one of relative sterility and failure. Take those aspects of phenomena which 
interest you as a human being most . . . and barren are all your results. Call 
the things of nature as much as you like by sentimental moral and esthetic 
names, no natural consequences follow from the naming. . . . But when you 
give the things mathematical and mechanical names and call them so many 
solids in just such positions, describing just such paths with just such veloci-
ties, all is changed. . . . Your “things” realize the consequences of the names 
by which you classed them.”
A fair interpretation of these pregnant sentences is that as long as objects are 
viewed telically, as long as the objects of the truest knowledge, the most real 
forms of being, are thought of as ends, science does not advance. Objects are 
possessed and appreciated, but they are not known. To know means that men 
have become willing to turn away from precious possessions; willing to let drop 
what they own, however precious, in behalf of a grasp of objects which they do 
not as yet own. Multiplied and secure ends depend upon letting go existent ends, 
reducing them to indicative and implying means. [John Dewey quoting William 
James, 1958, pp. 130–131]

Dialectics, Doubt, and Certainty
The relationship between apprehension and comprehension is dialectic in the Hegelian 
sense that although the results of either process cannot be entirely explained in terms of 
the other, these opposite processes merge toward a higher truth that encompasses and 
transcends them. The process whereby this synthesis is achieved, however, is somewhat 
mysterious; that is, it cannot be explained by logical comprehension alone. Thus the devel-
opment of knowledge, our sense of progress in the refinement of ideas about ourselves 
and the world around us, proceeds by a dynamic that in prospect is filled with surprising, 
unanticipated experiences and insights, and in retrospect makes our earlier earnest con-
victions about the nature of reality seem simplistic and dogmatic. As learners, engaged in 
this process of knowledge creation, we are alternatively enticed into a dogmatic embrace 
of our current convictions and threatened with utter skepticism as what we thought were 
adamantine crystals of truth dissolve like fine sand between our grasping fingers. The 
posture of partial skepticism, of what Perry (1970) calls commitment within relativism, 
that is needed to openly confront the conflict inherent in the dialectic process is difficult 
to maintain. The greatest challenge to the development of knowledge is the comfort of 
dogmatism—the security provided by unquestioned confidence in a statement of truth, or 
in a method for achieving truth—or even the shadow dogmatism of utter skepticism (for 
to be utterly skeptical is to dogmatically affirm that nothing can be known).
Our primitive ancestors leaned toward a dogmatic affirmation of apprehension and a 
tenacious reliance on immediate sensation and feelings, a concrete approach to knowl-
edge that was manifest in the formulation of animistic world views and a “science of the 
concrete” (Levi-Strauss, 1969). In Plato’s Phaedrus, the ancients’ mistrust of comprehen-
sion is nicely portrayed in the mythical conversation between the Egyptian god Thoth, 
who invented writing, and Thamus, a god-king who chastises Thoth for his invention:
This discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners’ souls because 
they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters 
and not remember of themselves. The specific which you have discovered is an 
aid not to memory, but to reminiscence; and you give your disciples not truth, 
but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many things and will 
have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know 
nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without its 
reality. [From Sagan, 1977, pp. 222–223]
The modern tendency, however, is to embrace the comprehension pole of the knowl-
edge dialectic and to view with suspicion the intuitions of subjective experience. 
The clearest and most extreme intellectual expressions of modern reliance on com-
prehension are manifest in the domination of American psychology by behaviorist 
theories and methodologies and in the epistemological philosophy that spawned 
behaviorism—logical positivism. In a zeal born out of the upending of the tidy sys-
163
Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
tem of classical physics before the discoveries of modern twentieth-century physics, 
positivism sought to affirm that all knowledge must ultimately be based on empirical 
or logical data. In this way, the most dogmatic of the positivists denied the existence 
of subjective experiences (apprehensions) except insofar as these were verifiable 
by a community of observers following logical and scientific conventions (compre-
hensions).
In response to the positivists’ dogmatic embrace of comprehension, Polanyi proposes an 
equally dogmatic embrace of apprehension to confront the modern supremacy of analytic 
powers:
As I surveyed the operations of the tacit coefficient in the act of knowing, I 
pointed out how everywhere the mind follows its own self-set standards, and I 
gave my tacit or explicit endorsement to this manner of establishing truth. Such 
an endorsement is an action of the same kind as that which it accredits and is to 
be classed therefore as a consciously a-critical statement.
This invitation to dogmatism may appear shocking; yet it is but the corollary to 
the greatly increased critical powers of man. These have enhanced our mind with 
a capacity for self-transcendence of which we can never divest ourselves. We have 
plucked from the Tree a second apple which has forever emperiled our knowl-
edge of Good and Evil, and we must learn to know these qualities henceforth in 
the blinding light of our new analytical powers. Humanity has been deprived a 
second time of its innocence, and driven out of another garden which was, at any 
rate, a Fool’s Paradise. Innocently, we had trusted that we could be relieved of all 
personal responsibility for our beliefs by objective criteria of validity—and our 
own critical powers have shattered this hope. Struck by our sudden nakedness, 
we may try to brazen it out by flaunting it in a profession of nihilism. But modern 
man’s immorality is unstable. Presently his moral passions reassert themselves in 
objectivist disguise and the scientistic Minotaur is born. [Polanyi, 1958, p. 268]
We are thus led to the conclusion that the proper attitude for the creation of knowledge is 
neither a dogmatism of apprehension or comprehension nor an utter skepticism, but an 
attitude of partial skepticism in which the knowledge of comprehension is held provision-
ally to be tested against apprehensions, and vice versa. The critical difference between per-
sonal and social knowledge is the presence of apprehension as a way of knowing in personal 
knowledge. It should be clear that the apprehensional portion of personal knowledge is all 
that prevents us from losing our identity as unique human beings, to be swallowed up in 
the command feedback loops of the increasingly computerized social-knowledge system. 
Because we can still learn from our own experience, because we can subject the abstract 
symbols of the social-knowledge system to the rigors of our own inquiry about these sym-
bols and our personal experience with them, we are free. This process of choosing to believe 
is what we feel when we know that we are free to chart the course of our own destiny.

The Structure of Social Knowledge: World Hypotheses
Since all social knowledge is learned, it is reasonable to suspect that there is some iso-
morphism between the structure of social knowledge and the structure of the learning 
process. Thus it seems likely that some systems of knowledge will rely heavily on com-
prehension and others will rely on apprehension; some will be oriented to extension and 
practical application and others will be oriented toward intention and basic understand-
ing. The philosopher Stephen Pepper, in his seminal work, World Hypotheses, proposes 
just such a framework for describing the structure of knowledge based on the funda-
mental metaphysical assumptions or “root metaphors” of systems for developing refined 
knowledge from common sense:
This tension between common sense and expert knowledge, between cogni-
tive security without responsibility and cognitive responsibility without full 
security, is the interior dynamics of the knowledge situation. The indefinite-
ness of much detail in common sense, its contradictions, its lack of established 
grounds, drive thought to seek definiteness, consistency, and reasons. Thought 
finds these in the criticized and refined knowledge of mathematics, science, 
and philosophy, only to discover that these tend to thin out into arbitrary 
definitions, pointer readings, and tentative hypotheses. Astounded at the thin-
ness and hollowness of these culminating achievements of conscientiously 
responsible cognition, thought seeks matter for its definitions, significance 
for its pointer readings, and support for its wobbling hypotheses. Respon-
sible cognition finds itself insecure as a result of the very earnestness of its 
virtues. But where shall it turn? It does, in fact, turn back to common sense, 
that indefinite and irresponsible source which it so lately scorned. But it does 
so, generally, with a bad grace. After filling its empty definitions and pointer 
readings and hypotheses with meaning out of the rich confusion of common 
sense, it generally turns its head away, shuts its eyes to what it has been doing, 
and affirms dogmatically the self-evidence and certainty of the common-sense 
significance it has drawn into its concepts. Then it pretends to be securely 
based on self-evident principles or indubitable facts. If our recent criticism of 
dogmatism is correct, however, this security in self-evidence and indubitability 
has proved questionable. And critical knowledge hangs over a vacuum unless 
it acknowledges openly the actual, though strange, source of its significance 
and security in the uncriticized material of common sense. Thus the circle is 
completed. Common sense continually demands the responsible criticism of 
refined knowledge, and refined knowledge sooner or later requires the security 
of common-sense support. [Pepper, 1942, pp. 44–46]*

Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
Root metaphors are drawn from experiences of common sense and are used by philoso-
phers to interpret the world. Each of the major philosophies has cognitively refined one 
of these root metaphors into a set of categories that hang together and claim validity by all 
evidence of every kind. From the seven or eight such clues or root metaphors in the epis-
temological literature, Pepper argues that there are only four that are relatively adequate 
in precision (how accurately they fit the facts) and scope (the extent to which all known 
facts are covered) and can thus claim the status of a world hypothesis.
The first of these, Pepper calls formism (also known as realism), whose root metaphor 
is the observed similarity between objects and events. The second is mechanism (also 
called naturalism or materialism), whose root metaphor is the machine. The third is 
contextualism (better known as pragmatism), with the root metaphor of the changing 
historical event. The final relatively adequate world hypothesis is organicism (absolute 
idealism), whose root metaphor is achievement of harmonious unity. None of these world 
hypotheses is reflected in pure form in the work of any single philosopher, since most 
philosophers tend to be somewhat eclectic in their use of world hypotheses. For purposes 
of understanding, however, we can say that formism originated in the classical works of 
Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and mechanism in the works of Democritus, Lucretius, 
and Galileo. Contextualism is more modern, originating in the works of Dewey, James, 
Peirce, and Mead, as is organicism, developed primarily in the work of Hegel and Royce.
The isormorphism between Pepper’s system of world hypotheses and the structure of the 
learning process becomes apparent in his analysis of the interrelationships among the 
four world hypotheses. Formism and mechanism, the two world hypotheses underlying 
modern science, are primarily analytic in nature, wherein elements and factors are the 
basic facts from which any synthesis is a derivative. Contextualism and organicism, on 
the other hand, are synthetic, wherein the basic facts are contexts and complexes such that 
analysis of components is a derivative of the synthetic whole. Within both the analytic 
and synthetic world hypotheses there is a further polarity between dispersive and integra-
tive strategies of inquiry. Formism and contextualism are both dispersive in their plan, 
explaining facts one by one without systematic relationship to one another. Indeed, both 
formism and contextualism see the world as indeterminate and unpredictable. Organi-
cism and mechanism are integrative in their plan, believing in an integrated world order 
where indeterminance is simply a reflection of inadequate knowledge. Because they seek 
integrative determinant explanations, the strength of the integrative world hypotheses 
(organicism and mechanism) is precision and predictability; their weakness is lack of 
scope, their inability to achieve an integrated explanation of all things. The dispersive 
world hypotheses, on the other hand, are weak in precision, offering several possible 
interpretations for many events, but strong in scope, since their explanatory range is not 
restricted by any integrative principle.
Figure 5.1 shows Pepper’s system of world hypotheses overlaid on the structural 
dimensions of the learning process. The analytic world views emphasize knowing by 
166 
Experiential Learning
comprehension, and the synthetic world views give primary emphasis to knowing by 
apprehension. The dispersive philosophies emphasize transformation by extension, the 
discovery and explanation of laws and events in the external world; the integrative phi-
losophies emphasize transformation by intention, the search for underlying principles 
and integrated meaning.
Formism and Mechanism—The Analytic World Hypotheses  
Based on Comprehension
Inquiry in modern science rests primarily on the metaphysical foundations of formism 
and mechanism. The modern version of formism, realism, incorporates many of the char-
acteristics of mechanism, such as an emphasis on space/time location, so that the two root 
metaphors are often indistinguishable. E. A. Burtt describes this interrelationship between 
the two analytic world hypotheses by illustrating how both are central to the concept of law:

Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
In its very essence this concept [law] preserves something vital in the formistic 
conception of “form” as well as something vital in the mechanistic conception of 
“regular interrelationship” among the parts of a machine. And I can think of no 
statement of either formism or mechanism as a metaphysical view, calculated to 
appear at all persuasive to any modern mind, which has not somewhere drawn 
upon those features of modern science which synthesize earlier formism and 
mechanism in precisely this fashion. [Burtt, 1943, p. 600]
There is, however, an important sense in which the two analytic world hypotheses sup-
port different modes of inquiry based on the dispersive nature of formism and the inte-
grative nature of mechanism. Mechanism as an integrative strategy is better suited as a 
foundation for basic research in the physical sciences and mathematics, whereas form-
ism’s dispersive plan is more attuned to inquiry in the applied sciences and the science-
based professions, where the dictates of practical circumstance often take precedence 
over the achievement of integrative frameworks. Even though the dispersive nature of 
formism creates constant difficulties of precision because of the many interpretations to 
which a single fact is amenable, from a practical standpoint this variety offers flexibility 
in problem solving.
Formism’s root metaphor of similarity is based on the commonsense perception of simi-
lar things. It is reliance on this root metaphor that allows the creation of systems of clas-
sifications based on similarity, such as the periodic table of elements or biological phyla. 
It is also the basis by which the validity of models, maps, and mathematical relationships 
is judged—that is, by similarity of these symbolic comprehensions to the reality being 
studied. Thus, the formist theory of truth is correspondence; the truth of a description 
lies in its degree of correspondence to the object of reference.
The modern formist inquiry strategy, sometimes called scientific empiricism, places 
great emphasis on the judgments of concrete existence through reports of sense experi-
ence controlled by the conventions of logic and scientific method. In this sense, even 
logical positivism, which adamantly denies any metaphysical foundation, is based on 
formism, since similar judgments by scientists of their sense experience are the basis for 
confidence in positivistic statements. Knowledge in modern formist inquiry is created 
when the community of scientists is able to agree on the reliable and accurate location of 
phenomena in time and space—to answer the inquiry questions, “When?” and “Where?” 
Singer (1959) traces the Platonic origins of such space/time individuation and compares 
this empirical approach to the rationalist Leibnitzian approach:
As for the tradition, it goes back at least as far as to Plato, who in his Timaeus 
makes space the “pure matter” that individuates general qualities (i.e., takes care 
of the distinction between this thing and that other precisely like thing). And from 
Plato’s time down, it would be possible to trace an imposing history of space-
time individuation. As for practical sanctions, our courts of justice recognize the 
168 
Experiential Learning
all-important difference between the evidence established by “identification by 
minute description” and the evidence established by “individuation by space-time 
coordinates.” The former, Leibnitzian, method of identification is exactly the one 
underlying our present method of “police identification.” With sufficient refine-
ment of detail, Bertillon measurements may be made to constitute an indefinitely 
minute description of the kind of man a certain individual is. But suppose the 
accused “identified” with the culprit to the limit of available description; how long 
would he remain in the dock could he establish an “alibi”? In insisting that the 
same individual cannot be in two places at the same time, in admitting that two 
individuals, however like, can be, the law throws the whole weight of its authority 
on the side of Kant and against Leibnitz. [Singer, 1959, p. 43]
The basic units of knowledge in formism are empirical uniformities and natural laws. The 
emphasis is on the analysis, measurement, and categorization of observable  experience 
and the establishment of empirical uniformities defining relationships between observed 
categories—that is, natural laws—with a minimum of reliance on inferred structures or 
processes that are not directly accessible to public experience.
Mechanism as a world hypothesis is less trusting of the appearances of sense experi-
ence and relies more on rationalist principles to analytically separate appearances from 
reality. The root metaphor of mechanism is the machine, and knowledge in mechanism 
is refined by analyzing the world as if it were a machine. Central to this analysis is the 
distinction between primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are those features 
and characteristics that are essential to describing the functioning of the machine. The 
traditional primary qualities have been size, shape, motion, solidity, mass, and number. In 
the case of a lever, for example, the primary qualities would be the length of the lever, the 
location of the fulcrum, and the weights applied at either end. Secondary qualities would 
be all other characteristics of the lever, such as its color and the material the weights are 
made of, that are not essential to explaining its functioning. As Democritus, one of the 
classical founders of mechanism, put it, “By convention colored, by convention sweet, by 
convention bitter; in reality only atoms and the void.” There are six steps or categories in 
mechanistic analysis:
 
1. Specification of the field of location in time and space. (In mechanism, every-
thing that exists exists somewhere, unlike classical formism, where form exists 
independently of particulars in time and space.)
 
2.  Identification of primary qualities.
 
3.  Description of laws governing primary qualities.
 
4.  Description of secondary qualities.
 
5.  Principles for connecting secondary qualities and primary qualities.
 
6.  Laws for regularities among secondary qualities.
169
Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
The theory of truth in mechanism is somewhat problematic, since, as Pepper points out, 
primary qualities can be known only by inference from secondary qualities; in other 
words, they are comprehensions:
. . . all immediate evidence seems to be of the nature of secondary qualities (all 
ultimate primary qualities such as the properties of electrons and the cosmic 
field being far from the range of immediate perceptions); moreover, this evi-
dence seems to be correlated with the activities of organisms, specifically with 
each individual organism that is said to be immediately aware of evidence. All 
immediate evidence is, therefore, private to each individual organism. It follows 
that knowledge of the external world must be symbolic and inferential. . . . So 
that in a mature mechanism, the primary qualities and all the primary categories 
are not evidence but inference, or if you will, speculation. [Pepper, 1942, pp. 221 
and 224]
The proper theory of truth for mechanism thus lies in the correlation of primary qualities 
with secondary qualities in what Pepper calls the causal adjustment theory of truth: Does 
knowledge of the machine in question allow the person to make causal adjustments with 
predictable consequences for secondary qualities?
The basic units of knowledge in mechanism are the primary qualities or structures that 
make up the world. Structuralism is thus a modern variant of mechanism. Model build-
ing is a typical inquiry method of mechanism that seeks to answer the basic inquiry 
question, “What is real? What are the basic structures of reality?”—as, for example, in the 
discovery of the structure of the DNA molecule.
We must stand in awe of the achievements of modern science and thereby give great 
credibility to the scientific inquiry methods based on formism and mechanism. These 
represent the highest refinement of human powers of comprehension. Yet ironically, the 
greatest achievement of scientific inquiry may be the discovery of its own limitations. The 
history of science is marked by the successive overthrow of widely accepted views of the 
nature of reality in favor of new, more all-encompassing but more question-provoking 
views. Today there is little dogma in enlightened scientific inquiry, for the assumptions 
on which scientific systems of comprehension are based have been challenged by scien-
tific discoveries at the forefront of knowledge. The invention and later validation of non-
Euclidian geometry in Einstein’s theory of space and time brought down the principles of 
nineteenth-century science and the “self-evident” Kantian a priori forms on which they 
were based. A number of subsequent discoveries brought into question the very notion 
of permanent external objects independent of the observer. Whether light is a wave or 
particle depends on how it is measured. The so-called “bootstrap” theory of the nucleus 
suggests that subatomic particles inside the nucleus of the atom have no self-sufficient 
existence, since their properties are determined by their neighbors, and vice versa. Thus, 
particles in the nucleus gain existence only when they are knocked out of the nucleus 
170 
Experiential Learning
by a scientist. The well-known Heisenberg principle of indeterminacy showed that one 
cannot measure both the location and the momentum of a particle with certainty. In 
Heisenberg’s words, “What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our 
methods of questioning.”
There are corresponding limitations and indeterminacies in formal systems of logic. In 
1931, Kurt Gödel showed that no consistent formal system sufficiently rich to contain 
elementary arithmetic can by its own principles of reasoning demonstrate its own con-
sistency, a theorem that defined the limits of comprehension as a way of knowing. From 
Gödel’s theorem we are led to the conclusion that to judge the logical consistency of 
any complex formal system, we must go outside it. Commenting on this indeterminate 
characteristic of formal systems, a characteristic that he calls tacit meaning, Polanyi says:
Thus to speak a language is to commit ourselves to the double indeterminacy due 
to our reliance both on its formalism and on our own continued  reconsideration 
of this formalism in its bearing on our experience. For just as, owing to the ulti-
mately tacit character of all our knowledge, we remain ever unable to say all that 
we know, so also in view of the tacit character of meaning, we can never quite 
know what is implied in what we say. [Polanyi, 1958, p. 95]
Contextualism and Organicism—The Synthetic  
World Hypotheses Based on Apprehension
The recently recognized limitations of comprehension-based knowledge structures have 
undoubtedly given sustenance to the development of the synthetic world hypotheses 
based on apprehension. John Dewey, in Experience and Nature, argued that the earlier 
dogmatic intellectualism of science created an unnatural separation of primary expe-
rience from nature in which nature became indifferent and dead and human beings 
were alienated from their own subjective experience, their hopes and dreams, fears and 
 sorrows:
The assumption of intellectualism goes contrary to the facts of what is primar-
ily experienced. For things are objects to be treated, used, acted upon and with, 
enjoyed and endured, even more than things to be known. They are things had 
before they are things cognized. . . . When intellectual experience and its material 
are taken to be primary, the cord that binds experience and nature is cut. [Dewey, 
1958, pp. 21 and 23]
The systems of social knowledge based on the synthetic world hypotheses operate under 
something of a handicap, since they must express understandings stemming from appre-
hension in the social language of comprehension. When the linear, digital descriptions 
of language and mathematics are used to describe the holistic, analogic context of appre-
hended experience, the result often seems exceedingly complex and abstract. Yet organi-
171
Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
cism and contextualism have proven themselves strong in the field of human values and 
practical affairs—areas where the analytic world theories are weak. Pepper states, for 
example:
It may be pointed out that the mechanistic root metaphor springs out of the 
commonsense field of uncriticized physical fact, so that there would be no ana-
logical stretch, so to speak, in the mechanistic interpretations of this field, while 
the stretch might be considerable in the mechanistic interpretation of the com-
monsense field of value; and somewhat the same, in the reverse order, with 
respect to organistic interpretations. Moreover, mechanism has for several gen-
erations been particularly congenial to scientists and organicism to artists and 
to persons of religious bent. Also, the internal difficulties which appear from 
a critical study of the mechanistic theory seem to be particularly acute in the 
neighborhood of values, and counterwise the internal difficulties of organicism 
seem to be particularly acute in the neighborhood of physical fact. [Pepper, 
1942, p. 110]
Like mechanism and formism, the synthetic world theories contextualism and organi-
cism tend to combine and:
. . . are so nearly allied that they may almost be called the same theory, the one 
with a dispersive, the other with an integrative plan. Pragmatism has often been 
called an absolute idealism without an absolute; and, as a first approximate 
description, this is acceptable. So a little more emphasis on integration, as Dewey 
for instance shows in his Art as Experience, produces a contextualistic-organistic 
eclecticism; as likewise a little less emphasis on final integration in organicism, 
as is characteristic of Royce. Royce even called himself somewhere a pragmatic 
idealist. [Pepper, 1942, p. 147]
The contextualist approach, however, has a certain affinity to the world of practical affairs 
in business, politics, and the social professions, whereas the organistic approach, with 
its emphasis on absolute values and ideals, is more attuned to the humanities, arts, and 
social sciences.
The root metaphor of organicism is what Burtt calls harmonious unity. The metaphor 
stems from the biological organism growing to its fulfillment. The central concern 
of organismic worldviews is growth and development, with a focus on the processes 
whereby the ideal is realized from the actual. These processes are most often conceived as 
some process of differentiation and higher-order integration. This process is teleological 
toward the absolute, not evolutionary as in the biological principles of natural selection, 
which are closer to contextualism’s open-ended developmental processes. The organismic 
view of development is the basis of modern humanistic developmental psychology—
most notably, Abraham Maslow’s theory of self-actualization—and in somewhat more 
172 
Experiential Learning
dispersive, contextual, evolutionary forms, organicism is the basis for research in cogni-
tive and adult development. Much historical analysis is loosely based on the organistic 
world hypothesis, although Hegel’s teleological progression to the Absolute is widely 
questioned. To modern organicists, Hegel’s view of development was a dogmatic and 
unnecessarily narrow progression from maximum fragmentation to his ultimate integra-
tion via the dialectic process:
Hegel was right, say these later organicists, in the inevitability of the trend of 
cognition toward a final organization in which all contradictions vanish. He was 
right in his observation that the nexes of fragments lead out toward other frag-
ments which develop contradictions and demand coherent resolution. He was 
right in his idea that these nexes have a particular attraction for those relevant 
traits which are peculiarly recalcitrant to harmonization with the facts already 
gathered. It was the aberrations in the orbit of Uranus, those recalcitrant data 
which refused to harmonize with the Newtonian laws, that particularly attracted 
the attention of astronomers and led to the discovery of Neptune. In all these 
things Hegel was right. But he was wrong and invited undeserved ridicule for 
the organistic program by his fantastic, arbitrary, and rigid picture of the path of 
progress. [Pepper, 1942, pp. 294–295]
The theory of truth in organicism is coherence and is derived from the endpoint of 
development, the Absolute—an organic whole that includes everything in a totally deter-
minant order. Thus, the truth of a proposition is the degree to which it is inclusive, deter-
minant, and organized in an organic whole where every element relates to every other in 
an interdependent system. There is a certain similarity in this description of organismic 
truth to the primary quality structures of mechanism, but in mechanism, the emphasis is 
on structures, whereas in organicism, it is on the processes by which progress is made to 
the determinant orderliness of the whole.
The basic inquiry question of organicism is one of ultimate values—why things are as 
they are. Whereas mechanism relies on symbols and the denotative functions of language, 
there is a tendency in organicism to rely on images and the connotative aspects of lan-
guage to describe the apprehensions (appearances) from which reality emerges. DeWitt 
identifies five characteristics of organic concepts: They are holistic, visually apprehended, 
organized aesthetically and neatly, and functionally based:
In sum [these characteristics] emphasize the relation of organic concepts to ordi-
nary experience; that is, experience in a universe where straight parallel lines 
meet at infinity, where the sun visibly rises and sets, where the earth is flat (at 
least its curvature is of no practical importance), where cause and effect have 
a direct sequential relationship, where action does not take place without an 
immediate objective as the motive of the action, where objects are visibly finite. 
This is the universe which accounts for almost all our everyday experiences but 
173
Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
represents a very limited range of experience—involving, if you will, the statisti-
cal fallacy that frequency of occurrence is an index of importance. [DeWitt, 1957, 
p. 182]
The final world hypothesis is contextualism. Although Pepper treats each of the four sys-
tems evenhandedly in his 1942 book, later, in Concept and Quality (1966), he embraces 
a modified version of contextualism (he calls his new world hypothesis “selectivism”) 
as the most adequate of the existing world hypotheses. The advantage of contextualism 
(selectivism) over the other three world hypotheses is that it integrates fact and value in 
an open-minded and open-eyed way—a way that is emergent and slightly optimistic, 
with no dogma of method or tool save a commitment to humanity. The root metaphor 
of contextualism is the historical event—not the past historical event, but the immedi-
ate event, alive in the present—actions in their context evolving and creating the future. 
Contextualism as a synthetic world hypothesis is concerned with the concrete event as 
experienced in all its complexity. The one constant in contextualism is change. Reality is 
constantly being created and re-created. Thus, the permanent forms of formism or struc-
tures of mechanism cannot exist in the contextualist worldview. Whitehead (1933, p. 255) 
puts it this way: “Thus the future of the universe, though conditioned by the immanence 
of its past, awaits for its complete determination the spontaneity of the novel individual 
occasions as in their season they come into being.”
Inquiry in contextualism is focused on the quality and texture of the immediate event 
as experienced; hence its association with phenomenology. Lewin’s (1951) conception of 
the person’s life space as a field of forces in which behavior is determined by ahistorical 
causation (only forces existing in the moment, such as a memory, determine behavior) is 
a primary example of contextually based theory. In this theory of truth, the contextualist 
works from the present event outward in what is called the operational theory of truth. 
The basic inquiry question is how to act or think. Actions are true if they are workable; 
that is, if they lead to desired end states in experience. Hypotheses are true when they 
give insight into—are verified by—the quality and texture of the event to which they  
refer. Hypotheses thus achieve qualitative confirmation by the experiences to which  
they refer. In pure contextualism, however, the truth of a hypothesis gives no insight into 
the qualities of nature; for nature is constantly emerging and changing. A hypothesis is 
only a tool for controlling nature. “It does not mirror nature in the way supposed by the 
correspondence theory, nor is it a genuine partial integration of nature in the way sup-
posed by the coherence theory of organicism” (Pepper, 1942, p. 275).

science, the science-based professions, and natural science and mathematics. The sig-
nificance of Pepper’s metaphysical analysis lies in the identification of the basic inquiry 
structures for refining knowledge. These are derived from simple metaphors of common 
sense, which lay bare the root assumptions on which knowledge in each system is based. 
His typology introduces some order to the tangled, fast-growing thicket of social knowl-
edge. The system is perhaps best treated in the framework of contextualism—as a set of 
hypotheses to be verified, as useful tools for examining knowledge structures in specific 
contexts. It is to just such an analysis that we now turn.
Social Knowledge as Living Systems of Inquiry— 
The Relation between the Structure of Knowledge  
and Fields of Inquiry and Endeavor
Knowledge does not exist solely in books, mathematical formulas, or philosophical sys-
tems; it requires active learners to interact with, interpret, and elaborate these symbols. 
The complete structure of social knowledge must therefore include living systems of 
inquiry, learning subcultures sharing similar norms and values about how to create valid 
social knowledge. Academic disciplines, professions, and occupations are homogeneous 
cultures that differ on nearly every dimension associated with the term. There are dif-
ferent languages (or at least dialects). There are strong boundaries defining membership 
and corresponding initiation rites. There are different norms and values, particularly 
about the nature of truth and how it is to be sought. There are different patterns of power 
and authority and differing criteria for attaining status. There are differing standards of 
intimacy and modes for its expression. Cultural variation is expressed in style of dress 
(lab coats and uniforms, business suits, beards and blue jeans), furnishings (wooden or 
steel desks, interior decoration, functional rigor, or “creative disorder”), architecture, 
and use of space and time. Most important, these patterns of variation are not random 
but have a meaning and integrity for the members. There is in each discipline or profes-
sion a sense of historical continuity and, in most cases, historical mission.
If the central mission of the university is learning in the broadest sense, encompassing the 
student in the introductory lecture course and the advanced researcher in the laboratory, 
library, or studio, then it seems reasonable to hypothesize that different styles of learning, 
thinking, and knowledge creation are the focal points for cultural variation among disci-
plines. Different styles of learning manifest themselves in variations among the primary 
tasks, technologies, and products of disciplines—criteria for academic excellence and 
productivity, teaching methods, research methods, methods for recording and portray-
ing knowledge—and in other patterns of cultural variation—differences in faculty and 
student demographics, personality and aptitudes, values and group norms. For example, 
Anthony Biglan (1973b) has found significant variations in departmental concerns and 
organization. In the soft areas (social professions and humanities/social science), there 
176 
Experiential Learning
is less faculty interaction than in the hard areas (science-based professions and natural 
science/mathematics); and in the hard areas, this interaction is strongly associated with 
research productivity. Hard-area scholars produce fewer manuscripts but more journal 
articles. The emphasis in soft areas is on teaching, and in hard areas on research. Applied 
areas (social and science-based professions) show more faculty social connectedness than 
do basic areas (humanities/social science, natural science/mathematics). Their research 
goals are influenced more by others, including outside agencies, although they are less 
interested in research than are their basic area colleagues. They publish more technical 
reports than their basic area colleagues, whose interest in research is not reflected in the 
time they spend on it.
In reviewing other research on differences among academic disciplines, one is struck 
by the fact that relatively little comparative research has been done on academic disci-
plines and departments. The reason for this lies in the same difficulties that characterize 
all cross-cultural research—the problem of access and the problem of perspective. The 
relatively closed nature of academic subcultures makes access to data difficult, and it is 
equally difficult to choose an unbiased perspective for interpreting data. To analyze one 
system of inquiry according to the ground rules of another is to invite misunderstanding 
and conflict and further restrict access to data.
To study disciplines from the perspective of learning offers some promise for overcom-
ing these difficulties, particularly if learning is defined not in the narrow psychological 
sense of modification of behavior but in the broader sense of acquisition of knowledge. 
The access problem is eased, because every discipline has a prime commitment to learn-
ing and inquiry and has developed a learning style that is at least moderately effective. 
Viewing the acquisition of knowledge in academic disciplines from the perspective of the 
learning process promises a dual reward—a more refined epistemology that defines the 
varieties of truth and their interrelationships, and a greater psychological understanding 
of how people acquire knowledge in its different forms. Twenty years ago, Carl Bereiter 
and Mervin Freedman envisioned these rewards:
There is every reason to suppose that studies applying tests of these sorts to stu-
dents in different fields could rapidly get beyond the point of demonstrating the 
obvious. We should, for instance, be able to find out empirically whether the bio-
logical taxonomist has special aptitudes similar to his logical counterpart in the 
field of linguistics. And there are many comparisons whose outcomes it would 
be hard to foresee. In what fields do the various memory abilities flourish? Is 
adaptive flexibility more common in some fields than in others? Because, on the 
psychological end, these ability measures are tied to theories of the structure or 
functioning of higher mental processes, and because, on the philosophical end, 
the academic disciplines are tied to theories of logic and cognition, empirical data 
linking the two should be in little danger of remaining for long in the limbo where 
so many correlational data stay. [Bereiter and Freedman, 1962, pp. 567–568]
177
Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
It is surprising that with the significant exception of Piaget’s pioneering work on genetic 
epistemology, few have sought to reap these rewards.
The research that has been done has instead focused primarily on what, from the per-
spective above, are the peripheral norms of academic disciplines rather than the piv-
otal norms governing learning and inquiry. Thus, studies have examined political/social 
attitudes and values (Bereiter and Freedman, 1962), personality patterns (Roe, 1956), 
aspirations and goals (Davis, 1965), sex distribution and other demographic variables 
(Feldman, 1974), and social interaction (Biglan, 1973b; Hall, 1969). The bias of these 
studies is no doubt a reflection of the fact that psychological research has until quite 
recently been predominantly concerned with the social/emotional aspects of human 
behavior and development. Concern with cognitive/intellectual factors has been neatly 
wrapped into concepts of general intelligence. Thus, most early studies of intellectual 
differences among disciplines were interested only in which discipline has the smarter 
students (for example, Wolfe, 1954; Terman and Oden, 1947).
The hypothesis to be explored in this section is that since learning, broadly conceived as 
adaptation, is the central mission of every discipline and profession, the cultural varia-
tions among fields of inquiry and endeavor will be organized in a way that is congruent 
with the structure of the learning process and the structure of knowledge. When one 
examines academic disciplines in the four major groupings we have identified—the social 
professions, the science-based professions, humanities/social science, and natural sci-
ence/mathematics—it becomes apparent that what constitutes valid knowledge in these 
four groupings differs widely. This is easily observed in differences in how knowledge 
is reported (for instance, numerical or logical symbols, words or images), in inquiry 
method (such as case studies, experiments, logical analysis), and in criteria for evaluation 
(say, practical vs. statistical significance). Figure 5.2 illustrates the specific relationship 
predicted among fields of inquiry, the structure of knowledge, and the structure of the 
learning process. We have in the preceding section elaborated on the relation between 
knowledge structures and the learning process and have seen in this analysis suggestions 
concerning the relation of knowledge and learning to living systems of inquiry. Synthetic 
knowledge structures learned via apprehension are associated with qualitative, humanis-
tic fields, whereas analytic knowledge structures learned via comprehension are related 
to the quantitative scientific fields, dispersive knowledge structures learned via extension 
are related to the professions and applied sciences, and integrative knowledge structures 
learned via intention are related to the basic academic disciplines.
The Structure of Academic Fields
The first suggestion that experiential learning theory might provide a useful framework 
for describing variations in the inquiry norms of academic disciplines came in Chapter 4, 
when we examined the undergraduate majors of practicing managers and graduate students 
in management (see Figure 4.4). Although these people shared a common occupation,  
178 
Experiential Learning
variations in their learning styles were strongly associated with their undergraduate edu-
cational experience. There was a good fit with the predictions outlined in Figure 5.2, 
showing a relation between the structure of learning as measured by individual learning 
style and one’s chosen field of specialization in college. Undergraduate business majors 
tended to have accommodative learning styles; engineers, on the average, fell in the 
convergent quadrant; history, English, political science, and psychology majors all had 
divergent learning styles; mathematics and chemistry majors had assimilative learning 
styles, as did economics and sociology majors; and physics majors were very abstract, 
falling between the convergent and assimilative quadrants. These data suggested that 
undergraduate education was a major factor in shaping individual learning style, either

by the process of selection into a discipline or socialization while learning in that disci-
pline, or, as is most likely the case, both.
We now examine how others perceive the differences between academic disciplines and 
whether these perceptions are congruent with the structure of knowledge and learn-
ing. Anthony Biglan (1973a) used a method well suited to answer these questions in 
his  studies of faculty members at the University of Illinois and a small western college. 
Using the technique of multidimensional scaling, he analyzed the underlying structures 
of scholars’ judgments about the similarities of subject matter in different academic dis-
ciplines. The procedure required faculty members to group subject areas on the basis of 
similarity without any labeling of the groupings. Through a kind of factor analysis, the 
similarity groupings are then mapped onto an n-dimensional space where n is deter-
mined by goodness of fit and interpretability of the dimensions. The two dimensions 
accounting for the most variance in the University of Illinois data were interpreted by 
Biglan to be hard-soft and pure-applied. When academic areas at Illinois are mapped on 
this two-dimensional space (Figure 5.3), we see a great similarity between the pattern of 
Biglan’s data and the structure of knowledge and learning described in Figure 5.2. Busi-
ness (assumed equivalent to accounting and finance) is accommodative in learning style 
and contextualist in knowledge structure. Engineering fits with convergent learning and 
formist knowledge. Physics, mathematics, and chemistry are related to assimilative learn-
ing and mechanistic knowledge, and the humanistic fields—history, political science, 
English, and psychology—fall in the divergent, organistic quadrant. Foreign languages, 
economics, and sociology were divergent in Biglan’s study rather than assimilative as in 
Figure 4.4. Biglan also reported that the pattern of academic-area relationships in the 
small-college data was very similar to that in the Illinois data.
These two studies suggest that the two basic dimensions of experiential learning theory, 
abstract/concrete and active/reflective, are major dimensions of differentiation among 
academic disciplines. A more extensive database is needed, however. The learning-style 
data came from a single occupation, and in the case of some academic areas, sample 
sizes were small. Biglan’s study, on the other hand, was limited to two universities, and 
differences here could be attributed to the specific characteristics of these academic 
departments.
In search of a more extensive and representative sample, data collected in the Carnegie 
Commission on Higher Education’s 1969 study of representative American colleges and 
universities were examined. These data consisted of 32,963 questionnaires from graduate 
students in 158 institutions and 60,028 questionnaires from faculty in 303 institutions. 
Using tabulations of these data reported in Feldman (1974), ad hoc indices were created 
of the abstract/concrete and active/reflective dimensions for the 45 academic fields iden-
tified in the study. The abstract/concrete index was based on graduate student responses 
to two questions asking how important an undergraduate background in mathematics or 
humanities was for their fields. The mathematics and humanities questions were highly 
180 
Experiential Learning
negatively correlated (–.78). The index was computed using the percentage of graduate-
student respondents who strongly agreed that either humanities or mathematics was very 
important:
% Math important + (100 - % Humanities important) 
 
2
Thus, high index scores indicated a field where a mathematics background was important 
and humanities was not important.

Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
The active/reflective index used faculty data on the percentage of faculty in a given 
field who were engaged in paid consultation to business, government, and so on. This 
seemed to be the best indicator on the questionnaire of the active, applied orienta-
tion of the field. As Feldman observed, “Consulting may be looked upon not only as a 
source of added income but also as an indirect measure of the ‘power’ of a discipline; 
that is, as a chance to exert the influence and knowledge of a discipline outside the aca-
demic  setting” (1974, p. 52). The groupings of academic fields based on these indices 
are shown in Figure 5.4.
The indices produce a pattern of relationships among academic fields that is highly con-
sistent with Biglan’s study and the managerial learning-style data. The results suggest 
that the widely shared view that cultural variation in academic fields is predominantly 
unidimensional, dividing the academic community into two camps—the scientific and 
the artistic (for example, Snow, 1963; Hudson, 1966)—is usefully enriched by the addi-
tion of a second dimension of action/reflection or applied/basic. When academic fields 
are mapped on this two-dimensional space, a fourfold typology of disciplines emerges. In 
the abstract/reflective quadrant, the natural sciences and mathematics are clustered; the 
abstract/active quadrant includes the science-based professions, most notably the engi-
neering fields; the concrete/active quadrant encompasses what might be called the social 
professions, such as education, social work, and law; the concrete/reflective quadrant 
includes the humanities and social sciences.
Some fields seem to include within their boundaries considerable variation on these 
two dimensions of experiential learning theory. Several of the professions (particularly 
management, medicine, and architecture) are themselves multidisciplinary, encompass-
ing specialties that emphasize different learning styles. Medicine requires both a concern 
for human service and scientific knowledge. Architecture has requirements for artistic 
and engineering excellence. Management involves integration of both quantitative and 
qualitative analysis in active decision making. Several of the social sciences, particu-
larly psychology, sociology, and economics, can vary greatly in their basic inquiry para-
digm. Clinical psychology emphasizes divergent learning skills, experimental psychology 
emphasizes convergent skills, and industrial and educational psychology emphasize 
practical, accommodative skills. Sociology can be highly abstract and theoretical (as in 
Parsonian structural functionalism) or concrete and active (as in phenomenology or eth-
nomethodology). Some economics departments may be very convergent, emphasizing 
the use of econometric models in public policy, and others are divergent, emphasizing 
economic history and philosophy. Indeed, every field will show variation on these dimen-
sions within a given department, between departments, from undergraduate to graduate 
levels, and so on. The purpose of this analysis is not to “pigeonhole” fields but to identify 
a common structural model for learning, knowledge, and field of inquiry that is useful 
for describing variations in the learning/inquiry process in any specific educational or 
work setting.

Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
The Structure of Careers and Career Development
Since learning is a lifelong process and knowledge is created at work as well as at the 
university, there is reason to suspect a similar isomorphism between knowledge/learning 
structures and the structure of career paths. The data presented in Chapter 4, showing the 
relationships with learning style of professional careers (Figure 4.5) and jobs  (Figures 4.6 
and 4.7), support this contention. More systematic relationships, however, can be seen in 
the occupational classification scheme developed by Anne Roe. In her book, The Psychol-
ogy of Occupations, she develops a two-dimensional scheme that defines eight general 
categories of occupations with six developmental levels in each category. The eight occu-
pational categories and paths of career development are these:
 
1. Service (from chambermaid to therapist)
 
2. Business contact (from peddler to promoter)
 
3. Organization (from messenger to president)
 
4. Technology (from laborer to inventor)
 
5. Outdoor (from laborer to specialist)
 
6. Science (from helper to scientist)
 
7. General culture (from clerk to scholar)
 
8. Arts and entertainment (from stagehand to artist)
Reviewing studies of the characteristics of persons in these fields, she states:
Groups are so arranged that, with one exception, contiguous ones are more closely 
related than noncontiguous ones. Each of groups IV, V, and VI is related to the 
other two to about the same degree. Group V placed between IV and VI, observ-
ing the close relationship between these two. The groups are arranged in this way 
because IV is also related to III and VI to VII, whereas V is less closely related to 
any of the others. The arrangement should be thought of as circular, that is, Group 
VIII is related to Group I as well as to Group VII. [Roe, 1956, pp. 144–145]
In her later work she suggests that in the circle arrangement, Groups I, II, III, VII, and 
VIII are classified as people-oriented career areas, whereas Groups IV, V, and VI are non-
people-oriented, and thus “an ordered, counterclockwise arrangement of these groups is 
not untenable” (1957, p. 217). These remarks serve to orient her career classifications on 
the two-dimensional framework of experiential learning theory.2 Figure 5.5 shows the 
correspondence between Roe’s circle of careers and the structures of learning, knowl-
edge, and fields of inquiry postulated by experiential learning theory. (Categories IV and 
2.  Other schemes show a similar isomorphism, such as that of Holland (Osipow, 1973, p. 60); compare 
Samuelson (1982) for the suggested link between experiential learning and Roe’s work.

The Structure of Careers Shown in Relationship to the Structure of Learning Knowledge and Fields of Inquiry

Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
V are reversed here, since I share Roe’s concern about the misplacement of the outdoor 
category, and in experiential learning theory terms, category IV (technology) should be 
more abstract.)
In addition, Figure 5.5 represents the developmental levels within each career path as six-
level pyramids rising from each category. These levels, according to Roe, are defined by 
increasing levels of responsibility, capacity, and skill.3 In this framework,  higher-level jobs 
require greater integrative complexity and adaptive flexibility (see Chapter 8) in order 
to deal with the greater extension of their responsibilities in time and space. Jacques has 
suggested that this extension can be measured with great reliability in jobs by what he 
calls the time span of discretion. As he defines it:
The higher a person goes in an executive system, the longer is the time frame-
work within which he or she works. . . . A job’s size can be directly and simply 
measured by completion times targeted for the longest tasks that are required to 
be carried out in that role, namely the time span of discretion. [Jacques, 1979, 
pp. 126–127]
Thus, the highest-level jobs in the eight career paths, such as scientist, inventor, and art-
ist, have time spans of discretion that transcend even lifetimes, whereas jobs at the lower 
levels are increasingly constrained in their time (and space) limits.
Figure 5.5 may serve as a focal point for a review of the very lengthy progress of argument 
in this chapter. It shows the relationships among the structure of learning, the structure of 
social knowledge, and living systems of inquiry (academic fields) and endeavor (careers). 
It has been argued here that the isomorphism among these structures is rooted in the 
structure of learning and, in particular, in the integration of the apprehensive and com-
prehensive way of knowing the world. Social knowledge is a cultural tool that comes alive 
only in the personal knowledge of the user. In the unique individuality of apprehended 
experience lies the creative force for expanding, shaping, and validating social knowledge. 
This social knowledge, in turn, is invaluable in guiding people in their choices of experi-
ences in a field of personal life space and physical reality that is expanding continuously, 
often by the proactive human tendency to choose experiences that explore and expand 
these boundaries. We have seen that the success of this learning venture is highly depen-
dent on the proper attitude—an attitude of partial skepticism requiring that each act of 
knowing be steadily steered between the Scylla of appreciative apprehension and the 
Charybdis of critical comprehension. The course thus steered is the path to development.
3.  In experiential learning theory terms, these levels can be seen as stages of development toward integra-
tive complexity. Referring to the cone model of development to be described in Chapter 6 (Figure 6.3), 
the reader can imagine viewing the cone from the bottom with the facing slopes of the cone peeled back 
to display the six levels of development described in each of the eight pyramids. These six levels roughly 
correspond to the six levels of consciousness described in Chapter 6 (Figure 6.2).

Update and Reflections
It is sometimes said that a man’s philosophy is a matter of tempera-
ment and there is something in this. A preference for certain similes 
could be called a matter of temperament and it underlies far more 
disagreements than you might think . . .
One keeps forgetting to go right down to the foundations.
One doesn’t put the question marks deep enough down.

We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are.
—Anias Nin
In Chapter 5, The Structure of Knowledge, I described William James’ dual knowledge 
theory that poses a dialectic relationship between appreciative apprehension and critical 
comprehension. The opposing realms of direct experience and abstract thought make 
knowledge not a static thing but a dynamic process of knowing where abstract social 
knowledge is continually created and re-created in the personal knowledge of individuals. 
The apparent certainty of the written word is continually judged and evaluated through-
out history by the experience of those who read it.
The experiential learning theory definition of learning as the creation of knowledge 
through the transformation of experience implies an isomorphism between the learning 
process, the nature of the knowledge created through it, and the learning spaces such as 
academic disciplines and occupations where knowledge is created (see Figure 5.2). The 
relationships between learning styles and educational specialization, professional careers, 
jobs, and adaptive competencies described in Figure 4.11 provide one example of this 
isomorphism. Chapter 5 further explores these relationships through the work of Stephen 
Pepper and Michael Polanyi.
The Spiral of Knowledge Creation
Another parallel is the spiral of learning from experience and the spiral of knowledge 
creation. Like the way the experiential learning cycle becomes a spiral through succes-
sive iterations of experiencing, reflecting, thinking, and acting to create new experiences 
for another cycling through the learning process, knowledge creation also is a spiraling 
process between subjective personal knowledge and objective social knowledge. Social 
knowledge, the explicit abstract concepts and processes that Vygotsky called the “tools” of 
187
Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
culture, is created from the personal knowledge of individuals and returns to transform 
the subjective personal knowledge experience of those persons and others, leading to the 
further creation and modification of social knowledge, and so on.
The experiential learning theory knowledge creation process is influenced by Polanyi’s 
concepts of tacit and explicit knowledge paralleling the experiential learning theory con-
cepts of personal and social knowledge (see pp. 157, 158, and 163). He believed that 
the tacit knowledge that underlies explicit knowledge is more fundamental; the base 
on which all knowledge resides. We know more than we can tell and, because of this, 
language and data alone cannot make knowledge explicit. Every human creation began 
with the appreciative apprehension of a concrete experience much of which lay in a tacit 
dimension beyond explicit naming and communication. The experience was shaped, 
named, and renamed forming an “idea” that was shared with others to become social 
knowledge that continued to be refined in their personal knowledge.
This spiraling process of personal and social knowledge in the process of knowledge 
creation is illustrated in one of the first experiential learning theory knowledge creation 
studies. Carlsson, Keane, and Martin used the experiential learning theory learning cycle 
framework to analyze the bi-weekly reports of research and development project teams in 
a large consumer products corporation. Successful project teams had work process norms 
that supported a recursive cycling through the experiential learning cycle. Projects that 
deviated from this work process by skipping stages or being stuck in a stage “indicated 
problems deserving of management attention” (Carlsson et al., 1976, p. 38).
In the mid-nineties Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) introduced a similar spiral of knowl-
edge creation using Polanyi’s tacit/explicit dimension of knowing to create a four-phase 
model of knowledge creation in Japanese companies that describes four modes of knowl-
edge conversion. The first phase, Socialization, is tacit to tacit knowledge conversion 
through sharing concrete experiences. Externalization is the second phase converting 
tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge through dialogue and reflection that articulates 
one’s tacit knowledge into words and images while eliciting the same process from others. 
This is followed by Combination, explicit to explicit knowledge conversion to systematize 
and apply explicit knowledge and information for organizational transfer. The fourth 
phase is Internalization where explicit knowledge is converted back into individual tacit 
knowledge by direct experiences that actualize and apply explicit knowledge through 
learning by doing. The model describes a continuous learning spiral that requires an 
organizational learning process that initiates and sustains it.
The model was later updated (Nonaka, Toyama, and Konno, 2000) to include Kitaro 
Nishida’s concept of ba (Nonaka and Konno, 1998) or learning space as it is called in 
experiential learning theory (see Chapter 7 Update and Reflections). Arguing that 
knowledge needs a place to be created, shared, and used, they see ba as the time and 
space necessary for individuals to meet and interact for knowledge creation. They 
188 
Experiential Learning
describe four types of these learning spaces that correspond to the four modes of the 
knowledge creation cycle respectively: Originating ba, an experiential place where indi-
viduals share and empathize with others; Dialoguing ba, where individuals share mental 
models to articulate tacit knowledge into concepts; Systematizing ba, where explicit 
knowledge is translated into written form for communication to larger groups; Exercis-
ing ba, where explicit knowledge is translated into action renewing the tacit component 
of knowledge in individuals.
Personal Characteristics and Ways of Knowing
The origin of explicit knowledge in tacit knowledge is similar to Stephen Pepper’s idea 
that refined ways of knowing are ultimately grounded in common sense. “And criti-
cal knowledge hangs over a vacuum unless it acknowledges openly the actual, though 
strange source of its significance and security in the uncriticized material of common 
sense. Thus the circle is completed. Common sense continually demands the respon-
sible criticism of refined knowledge, and refined knowledge sooner or later requires the 
security of common sense support” (Pepper, 1942, p. 46). Pepper identifies four indepen-
dent metaphysical worldviews based on common sense root metaphors that are equally 
adequate in their ability to provide credible explanations of facts and events. Formism is 
analytic and dispersive and is based on the root metaphor of similarity, while mechanism 
is analytic and integrative and is based on the root metaphor of the machine. Contextual-
ism is synthetic and dispersive and is based on the root metaphor of the historical event, 
while organicism is synthetic and integrative and is based on the root metaphor of the 
developing living organism (see pp. 164–175).
Pepper’s framework for describing philosophical systems has continued to be the source 
of many investigations since the publication of Experiential Learning. This work supports 
the idea that the philosophical preferences and inquiry preference of Pepper’s four meta-
physical worldviews are deeply rooted in the tacit, personal knowledge of the individual. 
Of particular interest to the examination of the role of personal knowledge in knowledge 
creation are those studies which have created and validated measures of a person’s adher-
ence to the four worldviews of formism, mechanism, contextualism, and organicism 
(Germer, Efran, and Overton, 1982; Johnson, Germer, Efran, and Overton, 1988; Harris, 
Fontana, and Dowds, 1977; Super and Harkness, 2003). The study by Super and Hark-
ness, who developed the Child Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ) based on Pepper’s four 
worldviews, supports the isomorphic relationship between the world hypotheses and the 
structure of learning shown in Figure 5.1 (p. 166). They found large negative correlations 
between the diagonal opposites formism and organicism (–.51) and mechanism and con-
textualism (–.58) with small to insignificant correlations between adjoining styles in Fig-
ure 5.1. Johnson et al. (1988) also found support for the isomorphism with a significant 
negative correlation between the LSI abstract/concrete (AC-CE) scale and organicism/
189
Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
mechanism on the OMPI accounted for largely by a strong correlation between concrete 
experience (CE) and organicism.
Other research with the measures has found relationships with the worldviews and person-
ality characteristics. Germer et al. (1982) developed the Organicism/Mechanism Paradigm 
Inventory (OMPI) to assess individual relative preferences for two of Pepper’s worldviews: 
organicism and mechanism. The OMPI is a forced choice inventory that asks individuals 
to choose their preference for the mechanistic or organic alternative on items that cover 
philosophical issues such as ontology, epistemology, image of man, analysis and causality, 
change, dynamics, and methodology, and practical concerns of ordinary people such as 
marital relationships, parenting, occupational, legal, and other interpersonal relation-
ships. It is not clear why the OMPI creators chose these two worldviews to oppose each 
other since the primary oppositions as described above seem to be formism vs. organi-
cism or mechanism vs. contextualism. Also, Pepper’s linear arrangement of the four by 
their relative distance from each other is formism-mechanism-contextualism-organicism.  
Pepper states, for example, “Formism and Organicism are especially hostile to each other” 
(1942, p. 147). That being said, the OMPI does seem to contrast the analytic (abstract) 
worldview with the synthetic (concrete) view since neighboring formism/mechanism and 
organicism/mechanism “seem to shade into one another” (1942, p. 147). Johnson et al. 
(1988) found that both formism and mechanism in the World Hypothesis Scale (WHS) 
(Harris, Fontana, and Dowds, 1977) correlate with OMPI mechanism, and organicism and 
contextualism from the WHS correlate with OMPI organicism.
Johnson et al. (1988), in a validation study of the OMPI, found that the two worldviews 
are associated with different personality characteristics. Organicists, who view reality in 
terms of changing, holistic patterns, are imaginative, aesthetic, complex, and changeable. 
They tend to be fluid, changing and creative, non-conforming, participative, and imagi-
native in their cognitive style and interpersonally active, autonomous, and individualis-
tic. Mechanists, who see reality in terms of stable, isolated elements, are down-to-earth, 
inartistic, simple, and predictable. They tend to be orderly, conventional, conforming, 
objective, and realistic in cognitive style, and interpersonally passive, dependent, and 
reactive. They conclude, “In short, individuals’ personalities mirror their overall philo-
sophical views” (1988, p. 833).
Also found were relationships between worldviews and theoretical orientations and prac-
tices. They studied four groups of scientists—sociobiologists, behaviorists, personality 
theorists, and human developmentalists—finding that their philosophical preferences 
on the OMPI were related to their theoretical predilections based on analysis of written 
statements of theoretical preference, journal publications, and symposia presentations. 
For example, they found that dialectically oriented human developmentalists endorsed 
an organismic worldview, whereas behaviorists espoused a mechanistic philosophical 
worldview on the OMPI.
190 
Experiential Learning
Johnson, Howey, Reedy, Gibble, and Ortiz (1989) studied four different occupational 
groups. In a group of hospitality educators, organismic scorers on the OMPI had an 
orientation that values theory above facts, choice over impersonal causality, and nonre-
ductionism over physicalism. The reverse was true of mechanistic educators. A group of 
Head Start employees and day care workers who were organismically inclined tended to 
value a holistic over a problem-solving approach to teaching. A group of psychology fac-
ulty and graduate student psychologists with artistic vocational interests scored high on 
organicism. In the fourth group organismically oriented psychotherapists showed more 
positive attitudes toward using music in psychotherapy.
Harris et al. (1977) developed the World Hypothesis Scale (WHS) to measure Pepper’s 
four worldviews. They found that pairs of friends sharing compatible world hypotheses 
experienced greater satisfaction in their relationships. Incompatible friends stated that 
they had less in common and would be less likely to remain friends and would not 
like to work together on an academic project. Similarly, patients who participated in 
psychotherapies based on world hypotheses compatible with their own perceived the 
therapies more positively.
Knowledge Structures and Disciplinary Learning Spaces
In addition to the structural correspondence between the structure of learning and the 
structure of knowledge just described, Table 5.1 proposes that this structural similarity 
also extends into academic disciplines, professions, and other fields of endeavor. These 
define the learning spaces or ba where learning and knowledge creation are nurtured and 
facilitated with each field accomplishing this task in its own unique culture. In Academic 
Tribes and Territories Tony Becher (1989) used the structure of knowledge framework 
in Chapter 5 to explore in depth the differences among these cultures through a study 
of research norms and practices in 12 contrasting disciplinary fields: biology, chemistry, 
economics, engineering, geography, history, law, mathematics, modern languages, phar-
macy, physics, and sociology. Becher argues that, “Knowledge is the prime commodity of 
academic life, and it is the nature of knowledge itself which gives shape to, even if it does 
not entirely determine, the working patterns of academic communities” (1990, p. 337). 
He described the traditions, taboos, territories, and tacit ways of knowing in four group-
ings of fields corresponding to the typology of fields of inquiry and endeavor in Figure 
5.1. The pure sciences, where knowledge is atomistic, cumulative, and concerned with 
universals, had cultures described as competitive, gregarious, politically organized, and 
task-oriented with high publication rates. The humanities, where knowledge is reiterative, 
holistic and organic, and concerned with particulars and interpretation, had cultures that 
were individualistic, pluralistic, loosely structured, and person-oriented with low pub-
lication rates. Technologies, where knowledge is purposive, pragmatic, and concerned 
with mastery of the physical world through production of products and techniques, 
191
Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
had cultures described as entrepreneurial, cosmopolitan, role-oriented, and regulated 
by professional values, where patents were substitutable for publications. The applied 
social sciences, where knowledge is functional, utilitarian, and concerned with enhancing 
professional practice through protocols and procedures, had cultures that were outward-
looking, power-oriented, uncertain in status, and dominated by intellectual fashion with 
consulting taking precedence over publication (Becher, 1994).
In a subsequent analysis Becher extended his analysis to examine disciplinary subcultures, 
the sub-disciplines or specialties within disciplines. In many cases these sub-disciplines 
fragment the unity of a discipline and are countercultural to the dominant norms of the 
discipline: “. . . there is an anarchic tendency for some sub-units, even in the heartlands 
of their discipline, to appear more closely related to counterparts in the heartlands of 
other disciplines than to sub-units in their own” (1990, p. 336). These specialties can also 
facilitate communication and interaction with other disciplines that share their inquiry 
norms, and can be the breeding ground for new ideas and approaches. There have been 
numerous studies of learning style differences within disciplinary sub-specialties that 
support Becher’s analysis. For example, Plovnick (1975, 1980) studied learning style dif-
ferences in senior medical students finding that family medicine and primary care were 
specialties chosen by accommodative and divergent medical students, internal medicine 
was chosen more often by convergers, and academic medicine and pathology tended to 
be chosen by assimilative students. Similarly, Loo (2002a, 2002b) found learning style 
differences among business students majoring in accounting, finance, and marketing.
Ludwig Huber (1990), while agreeing with Becher that the structure of knowledge influ-
ences the structure of disciplines, argues that the cultures of disciplines are embedded 
more deeply in social structure and are associated with traits such as political affiliations, 
social class, and private life preferences that cannot be solely attributed to epistemologi-
cal differences through a process of social reproduction based on Bourdieu’s concept of 
habitus.
Bourdieu defines habitus as, “systems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured 
structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which 
generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to 
their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery 
of the operations necessary in order to attain them” (1990, p. 53). The practices emerging 
from habitus are both durable “structured structures,” rules of the game, and generative 
structuring structures, strategies of the game, that allow for creativity and innovation 
within the structure. Habitus-shaped practices operate for the most part at practical and 
tacit levels with little conscious intention and reflection. Gerholm, for example, argues 
that acquiring tacit knowledge is critical for success in academia and disciplines such 
as the arts, though there are few possibilities to acquire it in graduate education. Thus, 
success in these fields favors those with habitus-acquired cultural capital, “a stock of 
192 
Experiential Learning
knowledge, a frame of reference and a capacity to make the proper judgments which are 
called ‘taste’ ” (1990, p. 269).
The concept of habitus, though more encompassing in a scope that includes lifestyle, 
values, and dispositions, is similar to the experiential learning theory concept of learn-
ing style. “Habitus gives practices a particular manner or style. The disposition of habitus 
identifies certain individuals as risk takers, others as cautious, some as bold, others as 
timid, some as balanced, others as awkward. Individuals do not simply conform to the 
external constraints and opportunities given them. They adapt, seize the moment, or miss 
the chance in characteristic manners” (Swartz, 2002, p. 63S).
Habitus practices and the academic fields where they are enacted are part of a deeper 
spiral of learning and knowledge creation that extends beyond individuals into the social 
structure. “Born into certain fields and then initiated into others, and finding themselves 
in certain positions, people somehow grasp how the game works, learn by doing and 
incorporate the generating schemes very much as a child learns its mother tongue and 
patterns of social behavior, i.e., a practical competence (le sens pratique, a feel for the 
game) without knowing the rules or consciously complying with them. Thus, a corre-
spondence—not determination—is at work between the field (the structures in which 
the history of a society has become institutionalized) and the habitus (the actors’ disposi-
tions in which the same history has been incorporated): they produce and structure one 
another and are reproduced and structured by one another” (Huber, 1990, p. 248).
The Knowledge Structures of Experiential Learning
Experiential Learning itself provides an interesting case study of the use of Pepper’s 
knowledge structures as defined in World Hypotheses. First, a reflection on my own tacit 
to explicit spiral of knowledge creation. I first read World Hypotheses as an undergradu-
ate at Knox College and was immediately drawn to its holistic worldview framework 
that defined the limited viewpoint of different knowledge structures and disciplines. I 
read the book in a seminar called “Personal Reconstruction” given by Bernard Loomer, 
who was a process theologian and a visiting scholar from his position as Dean of the 
University of Chicago Divinity School. He decried dogma and stressed the limitations of 
human understanding of the mysteries of the world. A particularly impactful assignment 
for me was a paper to be titled “My Elephant.” Using the famous tale of the blind man 
and the elephant as an analogy of our limited view of the world, he asked us to describe 
the elephant as we experienced and thought about it. In writing the paper I was acutely 
aware of the socializing tugs and pulls in the fields I loved—philosophy, religion, theatre, 
and psychology. In my primary major, psychology, I was also caught up in the internal 
battles between behaviorism and personality theory. What to this day still remains largely 
tacit for me is an understanding of my attraction to holistic models and my lingering 
suspicion about the certainty with which the specialized perspectives in them advocate 
193
Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
their perspectives. My hunch is that it is rooted in my blue-collar upbringing in a small 
Midwestern farm town where humility was a valued virtue and the few professionals in 
town were seen as prestigious but cosmopolitan outsiders. While World Hypotheses did 
not resolve these issues it gave me a perspective on them.
So some 25 years later when I had found another holistic worldview in experiential learn-
ing, I was delighted to discover that book again. The way his structural analysis of knowl-
edge mapped so perfectly onto the structure of learning in experiential learning theory 
gave me confidence that I was onto something important. It also gave me a  holistic per-
spective on how to approach my research. Pepper argues that his world  theories should be 
kept pure and consistent in their internal structural corroboration, but used eclectically 
in their application in practice. “Hence the insistence upon the exclusion of eclecticism 
within the world theories, and at the same time the recommendation to make reason-
able use of it in estimating the results of world theories” (1942, p. 341). “Since these four 
world theories were regarded by us as having about the same degree of adequacy, no one 
of them can be the judge of the others. Our general stand, therefore, is for rational clarity 
in theory and reasonable eclecticism in practice. . . . In practice, therefore, we shall want 
to be not rational but reasonable, and to seek, on the matter in question, the judgment 
supplied from each of these relatively adequate world theories” (1942, p. 330). “None of 
these theories of truth gives way to the others. Nevertheless, this survey gives a more bal-
anced and informed conception of the subject than could be got in any other manner” 
(1942, p. 347).
In any event, I did not begin Experiential Learning with an explicit plan to use “reasonable 
eclecticism” in my reliance on the worldviews of formism, mechanism, contextualism, 
and organicism, but it gradually became explicit in the process of writing that I was doing 
just that. Writing Chapters 1 and 2 I was not aware of explicitly following a contextual-
ist approach though it is how they appear in retrospect. In Chapter 3 I did explicitly 
recognize that I was taking a mechanistic approach with my structural analysis of the 
foundations of the learning process followed by the structure of knowledge in Chapter 
5. Chapter 4 contrasted the typical formist roots of individual type theories with my 
contextual approach to learning style. Chapter 7 was less explicitly constructed with a 
combination of formism and mechanism known more commonly as logical empiricism. 
Being about development, Chapters 6 and 8 were inevitably based on the organismic or 
idealist worldview.
Reading critical reviewers of this book, I fear that I may have confused readers by 
approaching the topic with Pepper’s “post-rational eclecticism.” Miettinen (2000) is par-
ticularly upset by my eclectic use of multiple root metaphors and holistic approach. “Kolb 
says that he. . . [wants] to suggest through experiential learning theory a holistic integra-
tive perspective on learning. . . . The method and procedure can be called eclectic. Kolb 
unites terms and concepts, extracting them from their historical context and purposes 
and puts them to serve the motives of his own presentation. As a result theoreticians 
194 
Experiential Learning
with quite different backgrounds, motives and incompatible conceptions can be used as 
founders and ‘supporters’ of experiential learning. . . . One cannot help concluding that 
Kolb’s motive is not critical evaluation or interdisciplinarity but an attempt to construct 
an ‘attractive’ collection of ideas that can be advocated as a solution to the social problems 
of our time and to substantiate the usefulness of his learning style inventory” (2000, p. 
56). Miettinen then, mistakenly, argues that my eclectic approach is contrary to Pepper’s 
approach citing a passage which argues that an eclectic method that takes the best of the 
world hypotheses is not appropriate for the creation of an  adequate world hypothesis. 
Pepper was referring there to the creation of an adequate world hypothesis that could 
compete with his four adequate hypotheses, not to the application of world hypotheses 
where he advocates a “reasonable eclecticism” in practice (see the Pepper quote above).
Others more pointedly suggest that I have botched or ignored their particular epistemo-
logical preference and adopted another that is particularly distasteful to them. Richard 
Hopkins, an avid phenomenologist, in “David Kolb’s Learning Machine” writes, “And 
it is curious that in a book that couples experience with learning, and that draws on 
a variety of philosophical perspectives, there should be so little reference to the major 
world philosophy of experience” (1993, p. 53). He argues that the book “ultimately breaks 
down under the weight of its structuralist reductions.” (1993, p. 46). He cites a paragraph 
at the beginning of Chapter 3 that begins, “The approach. . . will essentially be struc-
tural,” as evidence for his argument that the book is based on a structuralist, mechanis-
tic approach. In the omission he leaves out the words “in this chapter” (see Chapter 3,  
pp. 65–66) and ignores the first sentence of the next paragraph, “. . . we have seen in the 
last chapter how the more phenomenological, descriptive models of learning described 
by Lewin and Dewey are enriched and corroborated by Piaget’s structural dimensions of 
cognitive development—phenomenalism/constructivism and egocentrism/relativism.”
Similarly, Garner (2000) argues that my work is based on a formist epistemology citing 
a paragraph in Chapter 4 where I suggest the problem with type theories is their form-
ist epistemological base. He discounts a sentence later in the paragraph that states, “An 
alternative epistemological root metaphor, one that we will use in our approach to under-
standing human individuality is that of contextualism.” As an avowed Jungian organicist 
(or idealist as he calls it), Garner says that Jung’s typologies, “are the main foundations 
for the development of his learning styles” (2000, p. 341), which is not the case. He states, 
“Kolb is arguing that his work falls within a contextualist position and, at the same time 
believes he is able to connect his work directly with Jung’s idealist position. To bring 
together these two contradictory epistemologies is highly problematic and connections 
between the two must be viewed exceptionally cautiously” (2000, p. 343).
What I take from the above examples are the perils of trans-disciplinary, integrative 
scholarship that falls outside of established institutional and disciplinary boundaries. 
As others have noted, work that falls between disciplines is likely to be acceptable to 
neither. D. Christopher Kayes in his review and critique of experiential learning theory 
195
Chapter 5 The Structure of Knowledge
critics examined their argument against the multi-paradigm approach of experiential 
learning theory. “Because ELT lacks strong institutional standing, the argument goes, 
it lacks the institutional clout necessary to contribute to codified knowledge, and thus, 
ELT remains impotent in furthering any one profession” (2002, pp. 141–142). His reply 
emphasizes the value of the multi-disciplinary approach. “Criticisms that ELT lacks suf-
ficient institutional standing to influence academic advancement may suffer from a kind 
of professional myopia that constrains learning research to a highly consensual body of 
knowledge. . . . If the study of management learning seeks to increase learning in the 
academy, then it might use experiential learning theory as a guide. If the best learning 
systems engender diversity, then the best approach is to broaden, not narrow the field of 
inclusion. . . . An alternative approach comes from Geertz’s (1983) idea of ‘blurred genres’ 
in which scholars enlist multiple disciplines. . . . ELT—with its humanist ideology, prag-
matic aims, scientific justification and interdisciplinary roots—provides a lucid example 
of such blurring” (2002, p. 142).
Such is the deep and passionate adherence, which I have described above, to our epis-
temological worldview that we are particularly alert, and sometimes “hostile,” to use 
Pepper’s term, to perceived challenges from other worldviews. While Pepper maintains 
that his four-world hypotheses are independent and of about equal adequacy, capable of 
presenting credible interpretation of any facts and events, dialogue among adherents to 
the different worldviews can be difficult. Because they are based on different root meta-
phors, they ask different questions and have different criteria for successful answers. Yet 
I still persist in my holistic multi-disciplinary view. The scholarly conversations gener-
ated, including the misunderstandings, are enlightening to us all. I find some company 
with Pepper, who responding to critics of World Hypotheses replied, “. . . whether the 
root metaphor theory was not a world theory itself or one of the already described world 
theories pretending to be neutral, it is almost a sufficient reply to record that the root 
metaphor theory has been accused by various persons of being every one of these world 
theories. . .” (1942, pp. 347–348).

The Experiential Learning  
Theory of Development
The course of nature is to divide what is united and to unite what  
is divided.
—Goethe
T
here is a quality of learning that cannot be ignored. It is assertive, forward- 
moving, and proactive. Learning is driven by curiosity about the here-and-now 
and anticipation of the future. It was John Dewey who saw that the experien-
tial learning cycle was not a circle but a spiral, filling each episode of experience with 
the potential for movement, from blind impulse to a life of choice and purpose (see 
 Chapter 2, “Dewey’s Model of Learning”). He compared this progression in learning from 
experience to the advance of an army:
Each resting place in experience is an undergoing in which is absorbed and 
taken home the consequences of prior doing, and unless the doing is that of 
utter caprice or sheer routine, each doing carries in itself meaning that has been 
extracted and conserved. As with the advance of an army, all gains from what 
has been already effected are periodically consolidated, and always with a view 
to what is to be done next. If we move too rapidly, we get away from the base 
of  supplies—of accrued meanings—and the experience is flustered, thin, and 
confused. If we dawdle too long after having extracted a net value, experience 
perishes of inanition. [Dewey, 1934, p. 56]
Learning is thus the process whereby development occurs. This view of the relation 
between learning and development differs from some traditional conceptions that sug-
gest that the two processes are relatively independent. This latter perspective, which 
is shared by the intelligence-testing movement and classical Piagetians, suggests that 
learning is a subordinate process not actively involved in development: To learn, one 
uses the achievements of development, but this learning does not modify the course of 
development. In intelligence testing, for example, development is seen as a prerequisite 
198 
Experiential Learning
for  learning—it is necessary for a child’s mental functions to mature before more complex 
subject matter can be taught. Similarly, for Piaget, development forms the superstructure 
within which learning occurs. His research has been guided by the implicit assumption 
that the sequence of cognitive-developmental stages evolves from an internal momen-
tum and logic, with little influence from environmental circumstance. Recent research 
by those who might be called neo-Piagetians (such as Bruner et al., 1966) have called 
this assumption into question by showing in cross-culture studies that the child’s level 
of cognitive development at a given age is strongly influenced by access to Western-type 
schooling.
Learning and Development as Transactions  
between Person and Environment
Without denying the reality of biological maturation and developmental achievements 
(that is, enduring cognitive structures that organize thought and action), the experiential 
learning theory of development focuses on the transaction between internal characteris-
tics and external circumstances, between personal knowledge and social knowledge. It is 
the process of learning from experience that shapes and actualizes developmental poten-
tialities. This learning is a social process; and thus, the course of individual development 
is shaped by the cultural system of social knowledge.
This position has been best articulated by the Soviet cognitive theorist, L. S. Vygotsky. 
He used the concept of the zone of proximal development to explain how learning 
shapes the course of development. The zone of proximal development is defined as 
“the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent 
problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through prob-
lem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers” (Cole et 
al., 1978, p. 86). The zone of proximal development is where learning occurs. Through 
experiences of imitation and communication with others and interaction with the 
physical environment, internal developmental potentialities are enacted and practiced 
until they are internalized as an independent development achievement. Thus, learning 
becomes the vehicle for human development via interactions between individuals with 
their biologic potentialities and the society with its symbols, tools, and other cultural 
artifacts. Human beings create culture with all its artificial stimuli to further their own 
development. Vygotsky’s ideas about how the tools of culture shape development were 
greatly influenced by Friedrich Engels, who saw culturally created tools as the specific 
symbol of man’s transformation of nature—that is, production. As Vygotsky himself 
put it:
The keystone of our method . . . follows directly from the contrast Engels drew 
between naturalistic and dialectical approaches to the understanding of human 
history. Naturalism in historical analysis, according to Engels, manifests itself in 
199
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
the assumption that only nature affects human beings and only natural conditions 
determine historical development. The dialectical approach, while admitting the 
influence of nature on men, asserts that man in turn affects nature and creates, 
through his changes in nature, new natural conditions for his  existence. . . .
All stimulus response methods share the inadequacy that Engels ascribes to the 
naturalistic approach to history. Both see the relation between human behavior 
and history as unidirectionally reactive. My collaborators and I, however, believe 
that human behavior comes to have that “transforming reaction on nature” which 
Engels attributed to tools. [Cole et al., 1978, pp. 60–61]
It is this proactive adaptation that is the distinctive characteristic of human learning, a 
proactive adaptation that is made possible by the use of auxiliary cultural stimuli, social 
knowledge, to actively transform personal knowledge. For example, the symbolic tools 
acquired through the internalization of language allow us to anticipate, plan for, and 
practice reactions to upcoming situations in our life. As the tools of culture change, so 
too will the course of human development be altered (as with the widespread use of home 
computers; compare Papaert, 1980). In this sense, the laws and limitations of human 
development can never be known, since human nature is constantly emerging in the 
transaction between individuals and their culture.
The process of learning that actualizes development requires a confrontation and resolu-
tion of the dialectic conflicts inherent in experiential learning. The process is one that 
Paulo Freire describes as praxis—using dialogue to stimulate reflection and action on the 
world in order to transform it. Denis Goulet, in the introduction to Freire’s Education for 
Critical Consciousness, describes it this way:
Paulo Freire’s central message is that one can know only to the extent that one 
“problematizes” the natural, cultural and historical reality in which s/he is 
immersed . . . to “problematize” in his sense is to associate an entire populace 
to the task of codifying total reality into symbols which can generate critical 
consciousness and empower them to alter their relations with nature and social 
forces. This reflective group exercise . . . thrusts all participants into dialogue 
with others whose historical “vocation” is to become transforming agents of their 
social reality. Only thus do people become subjects, instead of objects, of their 
own history. [Freire, 1973, p. ix]
Differentiation and Integration in Development
From the dialectics of learning comes a human developmental progression marked by 
increasing differentiation and hierarchic integration of functioning. The concepts of dif-
ferentiation and hierarchic integration are fundamental to virtually all theories of cogni-
tive development and adult development. This principle of psychological development 
200 
Experiential Learning
was borrowed from biological observations of evolution and development that show 
increasing physical differentiation and integration as one moves up the phylogenetic 
scale, particularly in the evolution of the nervous system.
Differentiation has two aspects, an increasing complexity of units and a decreasing inter-
dependence of parts. The course of learning and development is to refine, discriminate, 
and elaborate the categories of experience and the variety of behavior while at the same 
time increasing the independence of functioning among these separate parts. An example 
of differentiation can be seen in the development of the infant’s emotional life. In an early 
observational study of young children, Katherine Bridges (1932) described the increasing 
differentiation of the growing infant’s emotions from undifferentiated excitement to the 
basic distinction between distress and delight, to a refined spectrum of emotions encom-
passing fear, disgust, anxiety, jealousy, joy, parental affection, and so on (see Figure 6.1).
Hierarchic integration is the organism’s organizing response to the complexity and dif-
fusion caused by increasing differentiation. Hierarchic integration is multilevel. At the 
first level are simple fixed rules for organizing differentiated dimensions of experience 
in an absolutistic way. For example, experience may be classified as either good or bad. 
At a somewhat higher level, alternative interpretive rules emerge, allowing for alterna-
tive interpretations of situations. The absolutistic right-wrong view of the world becomes 
somewhat more flexible by the use of simple contingency thinking; for instance, in situa-
tion A, this rule is true, but in situation B, another rule holds. At a still higher level, more 
complex rules than simple contingency thinking are developed for determining the per-
spective taken on experience. These rules are more “internalized,” free from fixed appli-
cation based on past experience or the external stimulus. The highest level of integration

Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
adds still another system of rules that forms a structure for generating very complex 
relationships. This highest level allows great flexibility in the integration and organization 
of experience, making it possible to cope with change and environmental uncertainty by 
developing complex alternative constructions of reality. These four levels of hierarchic 
integration, as they are described by Schroder, Driver, and Streufert (1967), are shown 
graphically in Figure 6.2.
Through hierarchic integration, the individual maintains integrity and wholeness 
through the creation of superordinate schema, including concepts, sentiments, acts, and 
observations. These schema organize and control the deployment of subordinate, differ-
entiated concepts, sentiments, acts, and observations. In the example above of differentia-
tion of the infant’s emotional life, the growing child develops progressively higher-order 
sentiments to control the application of these refined emotions to different settings and 
persons, introducing continuity and meaning to his or her experience. The unity and 
consistency of experience that at birth was the benefit of an undifferentiated view of the 
world must increasingly be purchased by integrative organizational efforts. Yet the divi-
dends of these developmental processes are great—an increasingly conscious awareness 
and sophisticated control of ourselves in the world around us. In Lewin’s conception, 
integration was presumed to lag behind differentiation, producing cyclic patterns of 
development alternating between stages dominated by the diffusion of differentiation 
and stages dominated by the unity of hierarchic integration—a description not unlike 
Dewey’s advancing-army metaphor quoted earlier.
Unilinear vs. Multilinear Development
The experiential learning theory of development differs significantly from most Piaget-
inspired theories of adult development in its emphasis on development as a multilinear 
process. The Piagetian theories of cognitive and adult development portray the course of 
development as unilinear, as some form of movement toward increasing differentiation 
and hierarchic integration of the structures that govern behavior. This is true of Piaget’s 
theory of cognitive development (Flavell, 1963), Loevinger’s theory of ego development 
(1976), Kohlberg’s theory of moral development (1969), Perry’s theory of moral and 
intellectual development (1970), the conceptual systems approach of Harvey, Hunt, and 
Schroeder (1961) and its derivatives by Hunt in education (1974), by Schroder et al. in 
information processing (1967), and by Harvey in personality theory (1966). Although 
experiential learning theory recognizes the overall linear trend in development from a 
state of globality and lack of differentiation to a state of increasing differentiation, articu-
lation, and hierarchic integration, it takes issue with the exclusive linearity of the Piaget-
ian approach in three respects.
First, it recognizes individual differences in the developmental process. In Piagetian 
schemes, individuality is manifest only in differential progression along the single yard-
stick of development—progression toward the internalized logic of scientific rationality.

Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
Individuals are different only insofar as they are at different stages of development. In 
experiential learning theory, however, individuality is manifest not only in the stage of 
development but also in the course of development—in the particular learning style the 
person develops. In this respect, the theory follows the Gestalt development approach of 
Heinz Werner:
The orthogenetic law, by its very nature, is an expression of unilinearity of devel-
opment. But, as is true of the other polarities discussed here, the ideal unilinear 
sequence signified by the universal developmental law does not conflict with the 
multiplicity of actual developmental forms . . . coexistence of unilinearity and 
multiplicity of individual developments must be recognized for psychological 
just as it is for biological evolution. In regard to human behavior in particular, 
this polarity opens the way for a developmental study of behavior not only in 
terms of universal sequence, but also in terms of individual variations, that is, in 
terms of growth viewed as a branching-out process of specialization. . . . [Werner, 
1948, p. 137]
A second difference arises from the transactional perspective of experiential learning that 
conceptualizes development as the product of personal knowledge and social knowledge. 
Since a person’s state of development is the product of the transaction between personal 
experience and the particular system of social knowledge interacted with, it is unrea-
sonable to conceive of this state as solely a characteristic of the person, the view held by 
Piaget.1 The developmental structures observed in human thought are just as likely to 
be characteristics of the social knowledge system; thus the findings that children with 
Western schooling display Piaget’s developmental progressions more consistently than 
those whose schooling is embedded in other cultural knowledge systems (Bruner et al., 
1966). This is an important proposition, for it argues that the paths of development can 
be as varied as the many systems of social knowledge. David Feldman has developed the 
ramifications of this view most thoroughly, suggesting a continuum of developmental 
regions ranging from the universals of intellect studied by Piaget (such as object per-
manance) through cognitive skills that are specific to a given culture, to a discipline-based 
knowledge system, and finally to idiosyncratic and unique capabilities that are developed 
by individuals through interactions with specialized or unique environments. Some of 
these unique accomplishments are judged to be creative, Feldman argues, and are fed 
back into the system of social knowledge, perhaps ultimately achieving disciplinary, cul-
tural, or even universal status.
Emphasis on the specialized paths of development leads to the third difference with Piag-
etian theories. For Piaget, all development is cognitive development. Experiential learning 
1.  “We have seen that there exist structures that belong only to the subject, that they are built, and that this 
is a step-by-step process. We must therefore conclude that there exist stages of development” (Piaget, 
1970a, p. 710).
204 
Experiential Learning
theory describes four development dimensions—affective complexity, perceptual com-
plexity, symbolic complexity, and behavioral complexity—all interrelated in the holistic 
adaptive process of learning. The recognition of separate developmental paths helps to 
explain certain developmental phenomena that are anomalous in the Piagetian scheme. 
Werner gives one such example, the case of physiognomic perception. This affective 
mode of perceiving, in which perception and feeling are fused (for example, a gloomy 
landscape), is characteristic of young children but also seems to be highly developed in 
the adult artist:
To illustrate, “physiognomic” perception appears to be a developmentally early 
form of viewing the world, based on the relative lack of distinction between 
properties of persons and properties of inanimate things. But the fact that in 
our culture physiognomic perception, developmentally, is superseded by logical, 
realistic, and technical conceptualization poses some paradoxical problems, such 
as, What genetic standing has adult aesthetic experience? Is it to be considered 
a “primitive” experience left behind in a continuous process of advancing logi-
fication, and allowed to emerge only in sporadic hours of regressive relaxation? 
Such an inference seems unsound; it probably errs in conceiving human growth 
in terms of a simple developmental series rather than as a diversity of individual 
formations, all conforming to the abstract and general developmental conceptu-
alization. Though physiognomic experience is a primordial manner of perceiv-
ing, it grows, in certain individuals such as artists, to a level not below but on a 
par with that of “geometric-technical” perception and logical discourse. [Werner, 
1948, p. 138]
Similar questions can be raised about the highly developed intuitive and behavioral skill 
of the executive (Mintzberg, 1973), which resembles in structure the child’s trial-and-
error enactive learning process.
Another example is what Turner (1973) calls recentered thinking, in which the relation-
ship of social knowledge to the specific knowing individual must be established in order 
for people to particularize general cognitive principles. This particularization requires the 
synthesis of affective and cognitive components. Although Piaget’s developmental theory 
specifies how concepts gain independence from concrete experience, it does not specify 
the processes by which concepts are revisited with personal experience. In Piaget’s terms, 
assimilation ultimately takes priority over accommodation in his theory of development.
The final point of difference lies in the practical implications of the issues above. As 
was indicated in the first chapter, Piagetian theories have had a profound influence on 
American education, primarily through Jerome Bruner’s introduction of Piaget’s work 
at the prestigious Woods Hole conference on education in 1958. This conference, which 
framed our nation’s educational response to the Sputnik challenge, found in Piaget’s 
developmental theory the ideal framework for emphasizing and rationalizing the tech-
205
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
noscientific dominance of education. In the race to regain the lead over the Soviets in 
technological supremacy, the educational system embraced scientific thinking as the way 
of knowing. Nurtured by federal largesse, educational institutions were transformed into 
technological institutions where scientific inquiry prospered and other approaches to 
knowing—the affective expression of the arts, the metaphysical reflection of philosophy 
and religion, and the integrative ideals of liberal education—all atrophied. Without in any 
way denigrating the intrinsic value or achievements of scientific inquiry, the multilinear 
developmental perspective of experiential learning suggests that science and technology 
alone are not enough. It rejects the view that other forms of inquiry must be subjected 
to science; that what ought to be is discovered in empirical investigation of what is; that 
the role of the humanities is to help us understand and cope with technological change 
rather than shape its directions. The true path toward individual and cultural develop-
ment is to be found in equal inquiry among affective, symbolic, perceptual, and behav-
ioral knowledge systems. Its intelligent direction requires integrated judgments about the 
future of humanity born from conflict and dialogue among these perspectives (compare 
Chapter 8, pp. 327–333).
The Experiential Learning Theory of Development
The way learning shapes the course of development can be described by the level of 
integrative complexity in the four learning modes—affective complexity in concrete  
experience results in higher-order sentiments, perceptual complexity in reflective 
observation results in higher-order observations, symbolic complexity in abstract  
conceptualization results in higher-order concepts, and behavioral complexity in active 
experimentation results in higher-order actions. Figure 6.3 illustrates this experiential 
learning model of development. The four dimensions of growth are depicted in the shape 
of a cone, the base of which represents the lower stages of development and the apex of 
which represents the peak of development—representing the fact that the four dimensions 
become more highly integrated at higher stages of development. Development on each  
dimension proceeds from a state of embeddedness, defensiveness, dependence, and reac-
tion to a state of self-actualization, independence, proaction, and self-direction. This 
process is marked by increasing complexity and relativism in dealing with the world and 
one’s experience and by higher-level integrations of the dialectic conflicts among the 
four primary learning modes. In the early stages of development, progress along one of 
these four dimensions can occur with relative independence from the others. The child 
and young adult, for example, can develop highly sophisticated symbolic proficiencies 
and remain naive emotionally. At the highest stages of development, however, the adap-
tive commitment to learning and creativity produces a strong need for integration of the 
four adaptive modes. Development in one mode precipitates development in the others. 
Increases in symbolic complexity, for example, refine and sharpen both perceptual and 
behavioral possibilities. Thus, complexity and the integration of dialectic conflicts among 
the adaptive modes are the hallmarks of true creativity and growth.
206 
Experiential Learning
The human developmental process is divided into three broad development stages of 
maturation: acquisition, specialization, and integration. By maturational stages we refer to 
the rough chronological ordering of ages at which developmental achievements become 
possible in the general conditions of contemporary Western culture. Actual develop-
mental progress will vary depending on the individual and his or her particular cultural

experience. Even though the stages of the developmental growth process are depicted in 
the form of a simple three-layer cone, the actual process of growth in any single life his-
tory probably proceeds through successive oscillations from one stage to another. Thus, 
a person may move from stage 2 to stage 3 in several separate subphases of integrative 
advances, followed by consolidation or regression into specialization.
Stage One: Acquisition
This stage extends from birth to adolescence and marks the acquisition of basic learn-
ing abilities and cognitive structures. This, the most intensively studied period of 
human development, is described by Piaget as having four major substages (Chapter 2,  
pp. 34–36). The first stage, from birth until about 2 years, is called the sensorimotor stage, 
because learning is primarily enactive; that is, knowledge is externalized in actions and 
the feel of the environment. Thus, accommodative learning, apprehension transformed 
by extension, is the dominant mode of adaptation. The second stage, from 2 to 6 years, is 
called the iconic stage, because at this point, internalized images begin to have indepen-
dent status from the objects they represent. It is at this stage that early forms of divergent 
learning, apprehension transformed by intention, are acquired. The third stage, from 7 to 
11 years, marks the beginning of symbolic development in what Piaget calls the stage of 
concrete operations. Here the child begins development of the logic of classes and rela-
tions and inductive powers—in other words, assimilative learning via the transformation 
of comprehension by intention. The final stage of development in Piaget’s scheme occurs 
in adolescence (12 to 15 years). Here, symbolic powers achieve total independence from 
concrete reality in the development of representational logic and the process of hypo-
thetical deductive reasoning. These powers enable the child to imagine or hypothesize 
implications of purely symbolic systems and test them out in reality—convergent learn-
ing via transformation of comprehensions by extension. Development in the acquisition 
phase is marked by the gradual emergence of internalized structures that allow the child 
to gain a sense of self that is separate and distinct from the surrounding environment. 
This increasing freedom from undifferentiated immersion in the world begins with basic 
discrimination between internal and external stimuli and ends with that delineation of 
the boundaries of selfhood that Erikson (1959) has called the identity crisis.
Stage Two: Specialization
This stage extends through formal education and/or career training and the early experi-
ences of adulthood in work and personal life. People shaped by cultural, educational, and 
organizational socialization forces develop increased competence in a specialized mode 
of adaptation that enables them to master the particular life tasks they encounter in their 
chosen career (in the broadest sense of the word) paths. Although children in their early 
experiences in family and school may already have begun to develop specialized prefer-
ences and abilities in their learning orientations (see Hudson, 1966), in secondary school 
208 
Experiential Learning
and beyond they begin to make choices that will significantly shape the course of their 
development. The choice of college versus trade apprenticeship, the choice of academic 
specialization, and even such cultural factors as the choice of where to live begin to selec-
tively determine the socialization experiences people will have and thereby influence and 
shape their mode of adaptation to the world. The choices a person makes in this process 
tend to have an accentuating, self-fulfilling quality that promotes specialization.
In the experiential learning theory of adult development, stability and change in life paths 
are seen as resulting from the interaction between internal personality dynamics and 
external social forces in a manner much like that described by Super et al. (1963). The 
most powerful developmental dynamic that emerges from this interaction is the tendency 
for there to be a closer and closer match between self characteristics and environmental 
demands. This match comes about in two ways: (1) Environments tend to change per-
sonal characteristics to fit them (socialization), and (2) people tend to select themselves 
into environments that are consistent with their personal characteristics. Thus, develop-
ment in general tends to follow a path toward accentuation of personal characteristics 
and skills (Feldman and Newcomb, 1969; Kolb and Goldman, 1973), in that develop-
ment is a product of the interaction between choices and socialization experiences that 
match these choice dispositions such that resulting experiences further reinforce the 
same choice disposition for later experience. This process is inherent in the concept 
of learning styles as possibility-processing structures that govern transactions with the 
environment and thereby define and stabilize individuality.
Thus, in the specialization stage of development, the person achieves a sense of indi-
viduality through the acquisition of a specialized adaptive competence in dealing with 
the demands of a chosen “career.” One’s sense of self-worth is based on the rewards and 
recognition received for doing “work” well. The self in this stage is defined primarily in 
terms of content—things I can do, experiences I have had, goods and qualities I possess. 
The primary mode of relating to the world is interaction—I act on the world (build the 
bridge, raise the family) and the world acts on me (pays me money, fills me with bits of 
knowledge), but neither is fundamentally changed by the other. Paulo Freire describes 
this stage-2 sense of self and the “banking” concept of education that serves to reinforce it:
Implicit in the banking concept is the assumption of a dichotomy between man 
and the world: Man is merely in the world, not with the world or with others; 
man is spectator, not re-creator. In this view, man is not a conscious being; he is 
rather the possessor of a consciousness; an empty “mind” passively open to the 
reception of deposits of reality from the world outside. . . . This view makes no 
distinction between being accessible to consciousness and entering conscious-
ness. The distinction, however, is essential: The objects which surround me are 
simply accessible to my consciousness not located within it.
It follows logically from the banking notion of consciousness that the educa-
tor’s role is to regulate the way the world “enters into” the students. His task is to 
209
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
organize a process which already occurs spontaneously, to “fill” the students by 
making deposits of information which he considers to constitute true knowledge. 
And since men “receive” the world as passive entities, education should make 
them more passive still, and adapt them to the world. The educated man is the 
adapted man, because he is better “fit” for the world. [Freire, 1974, p. 62]
Stage Three: Integration
The specialized developmental accomplishments of stage 2 bring social security and 
achievement, often paid for by the subjugation of personal fulfillment needs. The restric-
tive effects that society’s socializing institutions have on personal fulfillment have been a 
continuing theme of Western thought, particularly since the Enlightenment. Freud and 
his followers in psychoanalysis developed the socioemotional dimensions of this con-
flict between individual and society—libidinous instincts clashing with repressive social 
demands. In modern organization theory, this conflict has been most clearly articulated 
by Argyris (1962). Yet it is Carl Jung’s formulation of this conflict and the dimensions of 
its resolution in his theory of psychological types that is most relevant here. The Jung-
ian theory of types, like the experiential learning model, is based on a dialectic model of 
adaptation to the world. Fulfillment, or individuation, as Jung calls it, is accomplished by 
higher-level integration and expression of nondominant modes of dealing with the world. 
This drive for fulfillment, however, is thwarted by the needs of civilization for specialized 
role performance.
The needs of Western specialized society have long stood in conflict with individuals in 
their drive for integrative development. In 1826, the German poet and historian, Fried-
rich Schiller, wrote:
When the commonwealth makes the office or function the measure of the man; 
when of its citizens it does homage only to the memory in one, to a tabulat-
ing intelligence in another, and to a mechanical capacity in a third; when here, 
regardless of character, it urges only towards knowledge while there it encour-
ages a spirit of order and law-abiding behavior with the profoundest intellectual 
obscurantism—when, at the same time, it wishes these single accomplishments 
of the subject to be carried to just as great an intensity as it absolves him of 
extensity—is it to be wondered at that the remaining faculties of the mind are 
neglected, in order to bestow every care upon the special one which it honors 
and rewards? [Schiller, 1826, p. 23]
Commenting on this passage by Schiller, Jung says:
The favoritism of the superior function is just as serviceable to society as it is 
prejudicial to the individuality. This prejudicial effect has reached such a pitch 
that the great organizations of our present day civilization actually strive for the 
210 
Experiential Learning
complete disintegration of the individual, since their very existence depends 
upon a mechanical application of the preferred individual functions of men. 
It is not man that counts but his one differentiated function. Man no longer 
appears as man in collective civilization; he is merely represented by a function—
nay, further, he is even exclusively identified with this function and denied any 
responsible membership to the level of a mere function, because this it is what 
represents a collective value and alone affords a possibility of livelihood. But as 
Schiller clearly discerns, differentiation of function could have come about in no 
other way: “There was no other means to develop man’s manifold capacities than 
to set them one against the other. This antagonism of human qualities is the great 
instrument of culture; it is only the instrument, however, for so long as it endures 
man is only upon the way to culture.” [Jung, 1973, p. 94]
The transition from stage 2 to stage 3 of development is marked by the individual’s  
personal, existential confrontation of this conflict. The personal experience of the  
conflict between social demands and personal fulfillment needs and the corresponding  
recognition of self-as-object precipitates the individual’s transition into the integrative 
stage of development. The experience can develop as a gradual process of awakening 
that parallels specialized development in stage 2, or it can occur dramatically as a result 
of a life crisis such as divorce or losing one’s job. Some may never have this experience, 
so immersed are they in the societal reward system for performing their differentiated 
specialized function.
With this new awareness, the person experiences a shift in the frame of reference used 
to experience life, evaluate activities, and make choices. The nature of this shift depends 
upon the specifics of the person’s dominant and nonexpressed adaptive modes. For the 
reflective person, the awakening of the active mode brings a new sense of risk to life. 
Rather than being influenced, one now sees opportunities to influence. The challenge 
becomes to shape one’s own experience rather than observing and accepting experiences 
as they happen. For the person who has specialized in the active mode, the emergence of 
the reflective side broadens the range of choice and deepens the ability to sense implica-
tions of actions. For the specialist in the concrete mode, the abstract perspective gives 
new continuity and direction to experience. The abstract specialist with a new sense of 
immediate experience finds new life and meaning in abstract constructions of reality. The 
net effect of these shifts in perspective is an increasing experience of self as process. A 
learning process that has previously been blocked by the repression of the nonspecialized 
adaptive modes is now experienced deeply to be the essence of self.
Consciousness, Learning, and Development
In the experiential learning model of development, there are three distinct levels of adap-
tation, representing successively higher-order forms of learning. These forms of learning 
211
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
are governed by three qualitatively different forms of consciousness. We will refer to these 
three levels of adaptation as performance, learning, and development.
In the acquisition phase of development, adaptation takes the form of performance gov-
erned by a simple registrative consciousness. In the specialization phase of development, 
adaptation occurs via a learning process governed by a consciousness that is increasingly 
interpretative. The integrative phase of development marks the achievement of a holistic 
developmental adaptive process governed by a consciousness that is integrative in its 
structure. Thus, each developmental stage of maturation is characterized by acquisition 
of a higher-level structure of consciousness than the stage preceding it, although earlier 
levels of consciousness remain; that is, adults can display all three levels of conscious-
ness: registrative, interpretative, and integrative. These consciousness structures govern 
the process of learning from experience through the selection and definition of that 
experience.
How Learning Shapes Consciousness
To understand the role of consciousness in learning and development requires further 
examination of the structural learning model proposed earlier. Previous chapters have 
described four elementary forms of learning—accommodation, assimilation, conver-
gence, and divergence—and alluded to higher-order forms of learning that emerge from 
combinations of these elementary forms. In the developmental terms of differentiation 
and integration, the elementary learning processes are the primary means for differen-
tiation of experience; the higher-order combinations of the elementary forms represent 
the integrative thrust of the learning process. The conscious focus of experience that is 
selected and shaped by one’s actual developmental level is refined and differentiated in 
the zone of proximal development by grasping and transforming it.
To illustrate, take the example of my recent trip to the auto museum. Preoccupied as I 
was with explaining how learning from experience is developmental, I found myself dur-
ing the visit focusing on how I was developing my concept of automobile. First, I walked 
around and found many forms and variations of cars to refine and elaborate the concept; 
here I was learning via convergence, differentiating my concept through extension. Later 
I began learning about automobiles via assimilation, intensively transforming the concept 
to search for its precise meaning and critical attributes: How is an auto different from 
a bicycle? Must an automobile have an engine? In both cases, I was differentiating my 
conscious experience of the automobile concept.
Integrative learning occurs when two or more elementary forms of learning combine to 
produce a higher-order integration of the elementary differentiations around their com-
mon learning mode(s). In the automobile example, if I use the assimilative and conver-
gent forms of learning together, I search the museum for cars without engines and find 
none, although I do find a tricycle-like contraption with a small motor. The result is an 
212 
Experiential Learning
incremental increase in the symbolic integrative complexity of my concept of automo-
bile. Not only do I have a more extensive population of cars in my concept (acquired via 
convergence) and a more refined elaboration of the essential and nonessential attributes 
of the concept (acquired via assimilation), but in their combination, my comprehen-
sion of automobiles is increased. In determining that automobiles have some form of 
self-propulsion as an essential attribute and that “looking like a bicycle” is a nonessential 
attribute, my automobile concept has become more complex and integrated—an increase 
in actual developmental level. As such, it now asserts a greater measure of control over 
the choice and definition of my future focal experiences; for example, I now begin to see 
motorcycles as a special subcategory of automobiles.
In serving as the integrative link between dialectically opposed learning orientations, the 
common learning mode of any pair of elementary learning forms becomes more hierar-
chically integrated, thereby giving that common learning orientation a greater measure 
of organization and control over the person’s experience. This process is depicted in  
Figure 6.4 using the automobile example. Here, in the classic confrontation of the dia-
lectic between intention and extension of a concept, we find a unique resolution via the 
refinement of the concept to encompass greater differentiation via hierarchic integra-
tion—that is, an increase in symbolic integrative complexity.
Similar increases in hierarchic integration of the common learning mode occur with 
other pairs of elementary learning forms. When convergence and accommodation com-
bine, the result is an increase in behavioral integrative complexity via the resolution of the 
dialectic between comprehension and apprehension. In the pool-playing example cited 
in Chapter 4, convergent problem solving suggesting that the angle of incidence equals 
the angle of reflection, combined with the accommodative feel of the table, the cue stick, 
and the position of the balls produces refined behavioral skills in controlling the course 
of the cue ball. This refinement results from the comprehension of the basic laws of phys-
ics and the apprehension of the internal body cues and external physical circumstances 
integrated through extension—behavioral acts that operationalize the abstract concept 
in the concrete physical setting. The behavioral acts are guided and refined by a negative 
feedback loop between the goal defined by comprehension and the actual circumstance 
experience by apprehension; I keep practicing until I can hit the ball to the position I 
predict.
When the elementary learning forms of accommodation and divergence combine, the 
result is an increase in affective integrative complexity via the resolution of the dialectic 
between intention and extension. The artist stands before the canvas, brush in hand, 
experiencing a flow of images and feelings (divergence). The stroke of color applied 
(accommodation) externalizes the internal flow of experience, creating a frozen record 
of a dynamic process. The extent to which the stroke is successful in capturing that inter-
nal process is measured by its ability to recreate the internal gestalt of the moment of its 
birth, thus allowing the wholeness of that re-created experience to carry forward into the

are crystalized and refined, sentiments whose level of development is measured by their 
ability to sustain and carry forward experience (Gendlin, 1964).
The combination of the divergent and assimilative learning forms produces increases in 
perceptual integrative complexity via the resolution of the dialectic between apprehen-
sion and comprehension. The inductive model building of assimilation in combination 
with the apprehended observations of divergence produces more integratively complex 
categories of perception. Detective stories offer numerous examples of the synthesis of 
these two elementary learning forms, wherein the investigator is simultaneously induc-
ing scenarios of how the crime was committed from the clues gathered and creating new 
clues and observations by juxtaposing scenarios with actual events. The creative synthesis 
of the comprehended scenario and apprehended events is illustrated by the fact that these 
new observations are not only about what happened but also about what did not happen 
214 
Experiential Learning
but should have happened if a given scenario or alibi were correct. Thus, higher-order 
perceptual observations are not carbon copies of reality but integrations of what “is” and 
what “ought to be.”
Registrative, Interpretative, and Integrative Consciousness
To illustrate further the levels of consciousness in learning, let us return to my auto-
mobile museum trip. The focal experience in this case was my concept of automobile. 
In my learning from that experience using the elementary convergent form of learn-
ing, my comprehension of the automobile concept was extended by my examination of 
the array of cars in the local auto museum. In this process, the concept of automobile 
was elaborated via a consciousness that was basically registrative. Each car I examined 
was “filed away” as another instance of an automobile. The focal experience “concept of 
automobile” did not change but was elaborated through grasping it via comprehension 
and transforming it via extension. When this convergent learning process was combined 
with assimilation (thinking about the meaning and critical attributes of the concept of 
automobile), my consciousness took on an interpretive quality that began to alter the 
focal experience itself; that is, the combination of these two learning forms produced an 
increase in the symbolic complexity of my concept “automobile,” which in turn modified 
the focal experience to include bicycle-like self-propelled vehicles.
This second-level interpretative consciousness has two important characteristics that 
are lacking in the first-level registrative consciousness associated with the elementary 
learning forms. First, the combination of the two elementary learning modes creates an 
evaluative process that selectively interprets the focal experience. This is accomplished in 
the dialectic resolution of opposing learning modes (intention and extension, in the auto 
example). Second, this interpretation of the focal experience alters it selectively, redefin-
ing it and carrying it forward in terms of the hierarchically integrated learning mode. 
The combination of assimilative and convergent learning about the concept automobile 
refined the concept and enhanced the abstract/symbolic focus of the experience.
Thus the (second) interpretative level of consciousness associated with pairwise com-
binations of the elementary learning forms serves to define and shape the flow of 
experience, channeling it into more highly integrated forms of affective, perceptual, 
symbolic, and behavioral complexity. This level of consciousness gives direction and 
structure to the unfocused elaboration of registrative consciousness. But how then is 
the direction of the interpretative level of consciousness determined? How does one 
choose what experience to attend to and how to define it, either affectively, perceptu-
ally, symbolically, or behaviorally? In the absence of third-order integrative conscious-
ness, the process is the one of random accentuation described in the specialization 
phase of development. An experience is chosen (concept of automobile) that “pulls 
for” a particular orientation (comprehension), and the refinement of the orientation 
215
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
(via increases in symbolic complexity) further increases the “pull” for that orientation, 
creating a positive feedback loop that serves to channel experience more and more in 
that direction.
Integrative consciousness introduces purpose and focus to this random process via inte-
gration of the opposition between the grasping dialectic of apprehension and compre-
hension and the transformation dialectic of intention and extension. This “centering” of 
experience, although not easily achieved, serves to answer the more strategic questions 
of life, such as, why think about automobiles anyway? And why focus on the concept of 
automobile as opposed to the apprehension and aesthetic appreciation of particular cars? 
In this particular case, I choose automobiles more or less randomly to illustrate a point 
about the learning process. I choose to focus on the “concept” of automobile because the 
example of the dialectic between intention and extension is clearest for abstract concepts 
(see Chapter 3, pp. 77–78). As I now try to push the example to explain integrative con-
sciousness, I experience a kind of “stuckness.” The example seems academic, trivial, and 
unrelated to me personally; I am lacking any apprehension about the focal experience, 
“concept of automobile.” In searching for this personal relevance, I recall thinking, at the 
museum, that I would like to own a classic car, and further, that I often pause in airports 
to admire and get literature about those classic-car kits one builds on a Volkswagen 
chassis. On impulse, I have even bought a set of mechanic’s tools with this idea vaguely 
in mind. By my bringing these accommodative learning experiences to bear on my con-
scious focal experience, its nature changes to include apprehensions of my personal feel-
ings and desires about cars. The focal experience changes from concept of car to include 
specific cars and my relation to them, including the attractive fantasy of building one 
from a classic-car kit. Suddenly I begin to experience questions, and a fourth perspective 
on the experiences emerges—divergence, the transformation of these apprehensions by 
intention. How much of my self-image, money, and time do I really want to invest in a 
car? There is something vaguely decadent and ostentatious about fancy cars. And come 
to think of it, the whole concept of a self-propelled vehicle makes little sense in my life, 
where most things are close by and I need the exercise.
Even though this example may be a bit strained, it serves to illustrate the nature of inte-
grative consciousness. To interpretative consciousness, integrative consciousness adds a 
holistic perspective. Interpretative consciousness is primarily analytic; experiences can 
be treated singly and in isolation. Integrative consciousness is primarily synthetic, plac-
ing isolated experiences in a context that serves to redefine them by the resulting figure-
ground contrasts. Another feature of integrative consciousness is its scope. Its concern is 
more strategic than tactical, and as a result, issues in integrative consciousness are defined 
broadly in time and space. Finally, integrative consciousness creates integrity by centering 
and carrying forward the flow of experience. This centering of experience is created by 
a continuous learning process fueled by successive resolutions of the dialectic between 
apprehension and comprehension and intention and extension.
216 
Experiential Learning
Adaptation, Consciousness, and Development
With this example as a starting point, let us now turn to a more systematic formulation 
of the interrelationships among the stages of developmental maturation, the levels of 
adaptation, and the structure of consciousness as summarized in Table 6.1. It was Kurt 
Lewin who first articulated how consciousness increases in time/space extension with 
developmental maturation:
The three-month-old child living in a crib knows few geographical areas around 
him, and the areas of possible activities are comparatively few. The child of one 
year is familiar with a much wider geographical area and a wider field of activi-
ties. He is likely to know a number of rooms in the house, the garden, and certain 
streets. . . .
During development, both the space of free movement and the life space usually 
increase. The area of activity accessible to the growing child is extended because 
his own ability increases, and it is probable that social restrictions are removed 
more rapidly than they are erected as age increases, at least beyond the infant 
period. . . . The widening of the scope of the life space occurs sometimes gradu-
ally, sometimes in rather abrupt steps. The latter is characteristic for so-called 
crises in development. This process continues well into adulthood.
A similar extension of the life space during development occurs in what may 
be called the “psychological time dimension.” During development, the scope 
of the psychological time dimension of the life space increases from hours to 
days, months, and years. In other words, the young child lives in the immediate 
present; with increasing age, an increasingly more distant psychological past and 
future affect present behavior. [Lewin, 1951, pp. 103–104]
As the extension of consciousness increases, the same behavioral action is imbued with 
broader significance, representing an adaptation that takes account of factors beyond 
the immediate time and space situation. The infant will instinctively grasp the shiny toy 
before it; the young child may hesitate before picking up her brother’s toy gun, knowing it 
will make him angry; an adult may ponder the purchase of that same toy gun, considering 
the moral implications of letting her child play with guns. Thus, what is considered the 
correct or appropriate response will vary depending on the conscious perspective used to 
judge it. When we judge performance, our concern is usually limited to relatively current 
and immediate circumstances. When we judge learning, the time frame is extended to 
evaluate successful adaptation in the future, and the situational circumstance is enlarged 
to include generically similar situations. When we evaluate development, the adaptive 
achievement is presumed to apply in all life situations throughout one’s lifetime; and if 
the achievement is recorded as a cultural “tool,” the developmental scope may extend 
even beyond one’s lifetime.

Experiential Learning
Along with this relatively continuous expansion of the scope of consciousness, 
there are also discontinuous qualitative shifts in the organization of consciousness 
as growth occurs. These shifts represent the hierarchic addition of more  complex 
 information-processing structures, giving consciousness an interpretative and 
 integrative capability to supplement the simple registrative consciousness of infancy. 
William Torbert, in his seminal book, Learning from Experience: Toward Conscious-
ness, has described the hierarchic structure of consciousness as a three-tiered system 
of higher-order feedback loops. As in our approach, he uses this three-level structure 
of consciousness to solve problems that arise in explaining how the focus of experi-
ence (what constitutes feedback, in his terms) is determined. He explains his model 
as follows:
Recognition of these problems [of what constitutes feedback] has led social 
systems theorists to attempt to deal with them by postulating two orders of 
feedback over and above goal-directed feedback (Deutsch, 1966; Mills, 1965). 
Goal-directed feedback is referred to as first-order feedback. Its function is to 
redirect a system as it negotiates its outer environment towards a specific goal. 
The goals and boundaries of the system are assumed to be defined, so feedback 
is also defined. . . . The two higher orders of feedback can be viewed as explain-
ing how goals and boundaries come to be defined. Second-order feedback has 
been named “learning” by Deutsch. Its function is to alert the system to changes 
it needs to make within its own structure to achieve its goal. The change in 
structure may lead to a redefinition of what the goal is and always leads to a 
redefinition of the units of feedback (Buckley, 1967). Third-order feedback is 
called “consciousness” by Deutsch. Its function is to scan all system-environment 
interactions immediately in order to maintain a sense of the overall, lifetime, 
autonomous purpose and integrity of the system.
The terms “purpose” and “integrity,” critical to the meaning of “consciousness,” 
can be elaborated as follows: The “inner” conscious purpose can be contrasted 
to the “external” behavioral goal. Goals are subordinate to one’s purpose. Goals 
are related to particular items and places, whereas purpose relates to one’s life 
as a whole, one’s life as act. Purpose has also been termed “intention” (Husserl, 
1962; Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960) and can be related to the literary term 
“personal destiny.”
The concept of integrity can be related to Erikson’s (1959) life-stage that has 
the same name. A sense of integrity embraces all aspects of a person, whereas 
the earlier life-stage in Erikson’s sequence, named “identity,” represents the glo-
rification of certain elements of the personality and the repudiation of others 
(Erikson, 1958, p. 54). The distinction between a system’s identity and a system’s 
integrity can be sharpened by regarding identity as the particular quality of a sys-
tem’s structure, whereas integrity reflects the operation of consciousness. In this 
219
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
sense, consciousness provides a system with “ultrastability” (Cadwallader, 1968). 
Ultrastability gives the system the possibility of making changes in its structure 
because the system’s essential coherence and integrity are not dependent upon 
any given structure. [Torbert, 1972, pp. 14–15]
A simple example will illustrate these three levels of feedback and their interrelationship 
in determining behavior. The classic example of first-order feedback is the household 
thermostat. The setting of the thermostat represents the goal, and the built-in thermom-
eter is the sensory receptor that starts the furnace when the reading is below the setting 
and stops it when the set temperature is reached. A similar thermostat inside the human 
body performed this same registrative function of consciousness in our earlier time, 
when feeling cold led our ancestors to throw another log on the fire. Second-order feed-
back is created by the structure that governs how we set the thermostat. One person may 
set the thermostat at 70°F. The decision is based on a structure designed to maximize per-
sonal comfort. Another person may set the thermostat at 65°F. Her decision is based on a 
structure designed to save money. The units of feedback here are dollars. Thus, second-
order feedback structures are interpretive, governing both goals and the meaning (units) 
of feedback. Most of us share in some degree both these personal-comfort and economic 
structures, as well as others based on patriotic energy conservation, concern for one’s 
health, and so on. Third-order feedback provides the integrative perspective or integrity 
that allows for consistent choice about which structure or combination of structures to 
apply to this particular problem. It governs the process whereby we trade off the values 
and units of feedback defined by noncompatible structures and answer such questions 
as, how much will I pay to avoid feeling chilly at times? and, how much personal comfort 
will I sacrifice for the good of the planet?
The thermostat is a good model for registrative consciousness. Events are registered in 
consciousness on the basis of a structure that defines goals and units of feedback, but at 
this first level of consciousness we have no awareness of the higher-level structure that 
governs the process of registering experience. We respond automatically in terms of that 
structure, just as a thermostat would respond by turning on the furnace when it got dark 
if we replaced the thermometer with a light sensor. We undoubtedly share this first level 
of consciousness with the higher animals, whose second-order interpretive structures 
are largely instinctively determined. At this level of consciousness, the hierarchic inte-
gration of the four learning modes is low. Concrete experience is limited to stimulus-
bound sensations and feelings. The emergence of enduring sentiments that exist in the 
absence of their referent sets the stage for the beginning of interpretive consciousness. 
Similarly, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation 
are all immediate and bound up in the stimulus situation in the first stage of registrative 
consciousness, and they move toward a constancy of images, concepts, and actions as 
interpretative consciousness begins.
220 
Experiential Learning
With the hierarchic integration of the four learning modes and increasing affective, 
perceptual, symbolic, and behavioral complexity come the emergence of interpretative 
consciousness and second-order “learning” feedback.2 This is the distinctively human 
consciousness that most of us associate with the term. In addition to the simple registra-
tion of experience, there is an awareness of an “I” who is doing the registering and guid-
ing the choice and definition of a focal experience. As we have seen, this control of the 
choice and definition of our experiences is achieved by the development of higher-order 
sentiments, observations, concepts, and actions that interpret experience selectively. 
These highest-order structures can be seen as learning heuristics that control the defini-
tion and elaboration of experience by giving a priori preference to some interpretations 
over others.
An example of how learning heuristics operate to interpret consciousness is found in 
Adriaan de Groot’s (1965) research on how chess masters and novices perceive game 
situations and formulate chess strategy. It was originally thought that chess masters were 
more skilled than novices because they thought further ahead and examined more possi-
ble moves. It turns out that masters do not think further ahead and, in fact, examine only 
a few possible moves. Instead, they think about the game at a higher level than novices 
do, perceiving grouped patterns of pieces that act as a kind of filter to ignore “bad” moves, 
much as an amateur might use similar but simpler patterns in order not to perceive illegal 
moves, such as moving the rook diagonally. These higher-level learning heuristics serve 
to simplify and refine moves in the game by eliminating from consideration a vast array 
of potential moves that are of little value in viewing the game. Harry Harlow (1959) has 
argued that all learning is based on this process of inhibiting incorrect responses, creating 
internalized programs or learning sets that selectively interpret new experiences.
With specialized development, each learning mode organizes clusters of learning 
heuristics based upon that particular learning orientation. With increased affective  
complexity comes a self-aware system of sentiments and values to guide one’s life, a 
system that at higher levels becomes differentiated from a growing awareness of the 
values and sentiments of others. Increasing perceptual complexity is reflected in the 
development of perspectives on experience that have personal meaning and coherence. 
At higher levels of interpretative consciousness, one develops the ability to observe  
experience from multiple perspectives. Increasing symbolic complexity results first 
in Piaget’s stage of concrete symbolic operations and later in formal hypothetico-
deductive reasoning. Increased behavioral complexity results in achievement/action  
schemes—longer-term goals with complex action strategies to reach them. At higher 
2.  The reason that other animals do not develop the higher levels of consciousness may lie in the fact that 
they lack the symbolic comprehension powers associated with the left brain and thus cannot participate 
in the triangulation of experience that results from the dialectic between apprehension and comprehen-
sion producing hierarchic integration of experience.
221
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
levels of behavioral complexity, these action schemes are combined and traded off in a 
process that recognizes the necessity of risk taking.
Integrative consciousness based on third-order feedback represents the highest level of 
hierarchic integration of experience. In Torbert’s view, it is a level of consciousness that 
few achieve in their lifetime. The reason that integrative consciousness is so difficult to 
achieve is that interpretative consciousness has a self-sealing, self-fulfilling character 
that deceives us with the illusion of a holistic view of an experience when it is in fact 
fragmented and specialized (see Argyris and Schon, 1978). Precisely because interpreta-
tive consciousness selects and defines the flow of experience by excluding aspects of the 
experience that do not fit its structure, interpretative consciousness contains no contra-
dictions that would challenge the validity of the interpretation. The person highly trained 
in, say, the symbolic interpretation of her experience rests at the center of that interpre-
tative consciousness confident of the certainty and sufficiency of her view of the world. 
It is only at the margins that this view seems shaky, as with logical analysis of personal 
relationships; and only the most advanced forms of symbolic inquiry, such as Gödel’s 
theorem in logic, call its comprehensive application into question.
To achieve integrative consciousness, one must first free oneself from the domination of 
specialized interpretative consciousness. Jung called this transition to integrative con-
sciousness the process of individuation, whereby the adaptive orientations of the con-
scious social self are integrated with their complementary nonconsciousness orientations. 
In Psychological Types, he gives numerous examples of the power of the dominant con-
scious orientation (interpretative consciousness, in our terms) in thwarting this integra-
tion and of the strong measures needed to overcome it:
For there must be a reason why there are different ways of psychological adapta-
tion; evidently one alone is not sufficient, since the object seems to be only partly 
comprehended when, for example, it is either merely thought or felt. Through a 
one-sided (typical) attitude there remains a deficit in the resulting psychological 
adaptation, which accumulates during the course of life; from this deficiency a 
derangement of adaptation develops which forces the subject towards a com-
pensation. But the compensation can be obtained only by means of amputation 
(sacrifice) of the hitherto one-sided attitude. Thereby a temporary heaping up 
of energy results and an overflow into channels hitherto not consciously used 
though already existing unconsciously. [Jung, 1973, p. 28]
Jung’s prescription for the amputation of the dominant function is dramatized by his 
illustrative example of Origin, a third-century Christian convert from Alexandria, who 
marked his conversion by castration so that, in Origin’s words, “all material things” could 
be “recast through spiritual interpretation into a cosmos of ideas.” Betty Edwards, in her 
system for learning to draw by using the right side of the brain, suggests a less drastic 
approach for getting around the dominance of the specialized left-brain interpretative 
consciousness.
222 
Experiential Learning
Since drawing a perceived form is largely a right brain function, we must keep 
the left brain out of it. Our problem is that the left brain is dominant and speedy 
and is very prone to rush in with words and symbols, even taking over jobs 
which it is not good at. The split brain studies indicated that the left brain likes 
to be boss, so to speak, and prefers not to relinquish tasks to its dumb partner 
unless it really dislikes the job—either because the job takes too much time, is 
too detailed or slow or because the left brain is simply unable to accomplish the 
task. That’s exactly what we need—tasks that the dominant left brain will turn 
down. [Edwards, 1979, p. 42]
Because we are ensnared by our particular specialized interpretative consciousness and 
reinforced for this entrapment through the specialized structure of social institutions, 
we know little of the nature of integrative consciousness. Most descriptions of this state 
have come from the mystical or transcendental religious literature, descriptions that fall 
on deaf ears for those at the interpretative level of consciousness who find the rapturous 
prose about “golden flowers” and the “Clear Light” to be so much baloney. The problem, 
of course, is that integrative consciousness by its very nature cannot be described by any 
single interpretation. Thus, all these descriptions have an elusive and even contradictory 
quality, such as that which characterizes Zen Koans. For example:
Jōshū asked the teacher, Nansen, “What is the true Way?”  
Nansen answered, “Everyday; way is the true Way.”  
Jōshū asked, “Can I study it?”  
Nansen answered, “The more you study, the further from the Way.”  
Jōshū asked, “If I don’t study it, how can I know it?”  
Nansen answered, “The Way does not belong to things seen: Nor to things 
unseen. It does not belong to things known: Nor to things unknown. Do not 
seek it, study it, or name it. To find yourself and it, open yourself wide as the 
sky. [Zen Buddism, 1959, p. 22]
The transcendent quality of integrative consciousness is precisely that, a “climbing out 
of” the specialized adaptive orientations of our worldly social roles. With that escape 
come the flood of contradictions and paradoxes that interpretative consciousness serves 
to stifle. It is through accepting these paradoxes and experiencing their dialectical nature 
fully that we achieve integrative consciousness in its full creative force. This state of con-
sciousness is not reserved for the monastery but is a necessary ingredient for creativity in 
any field. Albert Einstein once said, “The most beautiful and profound emotion one can 
feel is a sense of the mystical. . . . It is the dower of all true science.”
In accepting and experiencing fully the dialectic contradictions of experience, one’s self 
becomes identified with the process whereby the interpretative structures of conscious-
ness are created, rather than being identified with the structures themselves. The key 
223
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
to this sense of self-as-process lies in the reestablishment of a symbiosis or reciprocity 
between the dialectic modes of adaptation such that one both restricts and establishes 
the other, and such that each in its own separate sphere can reach its highest level of 
development by the activity of the other. Carl Rogers, in his description of the peak of 
human functioning, describes as well as anyone the process-centered nature of integra-
tive consciousness:
There is a growing and continuing sense of acceptant ownership of these 
changing feelings, a basic trust in his own process. . . . Experiencing has lost 
almost completely its structure bound aspects and becomes process experienc-
ing—that is, the situation is experienced and interpreted in its newness, not as 
the past. . . . The self becomes increasingly simply the subjective and reflexive 
awareness of experiencing. The self is much less frequently a perceived object, 
and much more frequently something confidently felt in process. . . . Personal 
constructs are tentatively reformulated, to be validated against further experi-
ence, but even then to be held loosely. . . . Internal communication is clear, with 
feelings and symbols well matched, and fresh terms for new feelings. There 
is the experiencing of effective choice of new ways of doing. [Rogers, 1961, 
pp. 151–52]
The development of integrative consciousness begins with the transcendence of one’s 
specialized interpretative consciousness and continues with, first, the exploration of 
the previously nonexpressed adaptive orientations and, later, the full acceptance of 
the dialectic relationship between the dominant and nondominant orientation. This 
embrace of the dialectic nature of experience leads to a self-identification with the 
process of learning. As can be seen in the description of the highest levels of hierarchic 
integration in the four learning modes (Figure 6.5), this process orientation is reflected 
in the incorporation of dialectic opposites in each of the modal descriptions. The inte-
grative levels of affective complexity begin with the relativistic appreciation (in the 
fullest sense of the term) of value systems and conclude with an active value commit-
ment in the context of that relativism (compare Perry, 1970). Integration in perceptual 
complexity begins with a similar relativistic appreciation of observational schemes 
and perspectives and concludes with intuition—the capacity for choosing meaningful 
perspectives and frameworks for interpreting experience. With integrative conscious-
ness, symbolic complexity achieves first the ability to match creatively symbol systems 
and concrete objects and finally the capacity for finding and solving meaningful prob-
lems. Behavioral complexity at the integrative level begins with the development of an 
experimental, hypothesis-testing approach to action that introduces new tentativeness 
and flexibility to goal-oriented behavior—a tentativeness that is tempered in the final 
stage by the active commitment to responsible action in a world that can never be fully 
known because it is continually being created.

Experiential Learning
In his 1955 lithograph entitled “Liberation,” M. C. Escher captures the essence of the 
three developmental stages of experiential learning. The bottom third of the figure  
(Figure 6.5) shows the emergence of figures from an undifferentiated background, 
as in the acquisition stage of development. The middle third of the figure shows the 
articulation of form in tightly locked interaction between figure and ground, much as 
development in the specialization stage is achieved by finding one’s “niche” in society. 
The top of the figure shows the birds in free flight, emphasizing the process of flying 
over the content of their form, symbolizing the freedom and self-direction of integra-
tive development.

Update and Reflections
I believe that when human beings are inwardly free to choose  
whatever they deeply value, they tend to value those objects,  
experiences and goals which make for their own survival, growth 
and development and development of others. . . . Instead of uni-
versal values “out there,” or a universal value system imposed by 
some group—philosophers, rulers, priests, or psychologists—we 
have the possibility of universal human value directions emerging 
from the experiencing of the human organism.
—Carl Rogers
The experiential learning theory of adult development described in Chapter 6 starts 
with the premise that development occurs through the process of learning from 
experience viewed as transactions between individual characteristics and external 
circumstances—between personal knowledge and social knowledge. Vygotsky’s zone 
of proximal development is outlined as an example of how these transactions inte-
grate personal knowledge and social knowledge (see p. 198). Developmental progres-
sion in the theory is viewed as increasing differentiation and hierarchic integration 
of functioning, with the former preceding the latter in successive cycles of increasing 
integrative complexity. The Gestalt theorist Heinz Werner provides the basis for the 
multilinear experiential learning theory developmental model (Figure 6.3) which 
differentiates it from the Piaget-based unilinear models of adult development—e.g., 
Kohlberg, Perry, Kegan, and Loevinger. Unlike the Piagetian approaches, experi-
ential learning theory considers individual differences in development, allows for 
the influence of culture and context, and recognizes development as multidimen-
sional, encompassing affective, perceptual, and behavioral dimensions in addition 
to the exclusive Piagetian focus on cognitive development. Foregoing the detailed 
structural stages of the Piagetian models, development is broadly divided into three 
stages inspired by Jung—acquisition, specialization, and integration. The model 
then describes three levels of consciousness—registrative, interpretive, and integra-
tive—and three levels of adaptation—performance, learning, and development—
corresponding to the three stages respectively (Table 6.1). Since the publication of 
Experiential Learning, research has added support to the experiential learning theory 
development framework in some areas and suggested modifications in others. The 
update will review some of these insights.
226 
Experiential Learning
Culture and Context
Piaget’s structural genetic epistemology was a bold effort to describe the child’s develop-
ment toward the internalized logic of scientific rationality solely as an internal develop-
mental process independent of culture and context. But unfortunately his reach exceeded 
his grasp. As much as his structuralism illuminated how the mind works, as Jerome 
Bruner notes, there is much his structural approach does not explain:
Even from within the Piagetian fold, the research of Kohlberg, Colby, and others 
point to the raggedness and irregularity of the so-called stages of moral devel-
opment. Particularly, localness, context, historical opportunity, all play so large 
a role that it is embarrassing to have them outside Piaget’s system rather than 
within. But they cannot fit within. . . the system failed to capture the particular-
ity of Everyman’s knowledge, the role of negotiations in establishing meaning, 
the tinkerer’s way of encapsulating knowledge rather than generalizing it, the 
muddle of ordinary moral judgment. As a system it. . . failed to yield a picture of 
self and of individuality. [Bruner, 1986, p. 147]
Vygotsky provided a strong counterpoint focusing as he did on the cultural tools, par-
ticularly language, and contexts that influence development; though still on a unilinear 
cognitive track. For Vygotsky language influenced thought giving new meanings and 
ideas, whereas for Piaget thought develops through its own internal, logic that is not 
determined by language; language is the medium for the expression of thought. For both 
men the relationship between thought and language is interactional, not transactional as 
is the enactivist learning spiral described in Chapter 2 Update and Reflections. Vygotsky’s 
famous example of how Marxist ideas improve the conceptual development of the mind 
and even his proximal zone of development where a more developed consciousness aids 
a lesser developed consciousness seem one-way and unilateral. Compare this with the 
transactional emergence of Gadamer’s (1965) conversation, which is larger than the con-
sciousness of any player, or of Freire’s (1970) dialogue among equals.
Bruner argues that theories of development are more than descriptions of human growth; 
they acquire a normative influence that gives a social reality to the principles of the 
theory. He states, “. . . the truths of theories of development are relative to the cultural 
contexts in which they are applied. . . a question of congruence of values that prevail in 
the culture. It is this congruence that gives development theories—proposed initially 
as mere descriptions—a moral face once they have become embodied in the broader 
culture” (1986, p. 135). Barbara Rogoff (2003) gives a striking example in her research 
comparing educational practices in indigenous communities of the Americas with those 
of Western European heritage societies. In the Western societies children are organized 
by tight age grades and segregated from the mature activities of the community, spend-
ing their time in institutions such as schools where they are taught generalized abstract 
knowledge to prepare them for their later life in the society. This system is supported and 
227
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
justified by models of development based on reason and abstract universal knowledge 
from the Enlightenment to Piaget. In the indigenous communities children of all ages 
have wide access to community activities in which they will be expected to engage. They 
engage in direct learning from ongoing experience, through observation, collaboration, 
and ongoing support from others. Ethnographic studies of these communities suggest 
that children are more attentive and collaborative than Western middle-class children.
Individual Differences and Multilinear Development
In Piagetian schemes, individuality is manifest only in differential progression along the 
single yardstick of development—progression toward the internalized logic of scientific 
rationality. In experiential learning theory individuality is manifest not only in the stage 
of development but also in the course of development. Studies of gender differences in 
adult development and the ontological, being dimensions of development, tend to sup-
port the experiential learning theory view.
Gender Differences in Development
Carol Gilligan’s (1982) theory of moral development, which studied 29 women consider-
ing abortions, challenged Kohlberg’s unidimensional rational moral development theory 
by showing that women emphasize caring to deal with moral dilemmas in contrast to 
men’s focus on justice. In Women’s Ways of Knowing, Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger, and 
Tarule (1986) challenged Perry’s (1970) model of intellectual development in the same 
way. Their research identified two different dimensions of development—connected 
knowing and separate knowing. Women tended to use connected knowing, an empa-
thetic approach that takes others’ perspectives to understand their ideas. Men on the 
other hand tend to detach themselves from others in an attempt to objectively challenge 
and doubt their ideas. Similarly, Baxter-Magolda (1992), in a replication of Perry’s model, 
found an overlap between men and women in their positions in Perry’s system but also 
found receptivity and interpersonal patterns of reasoning in women and impersonal 
mastery-oriented reasoning in men.
Knight and colleagues (1995, 1997) developed a measure of separate and connected 
knowing and related it to scores on the Kolb Learning Style Inventory, predicting that 
separate knowing would be related to abstract conceptualization and connected knowing 
would be related to concrete experience. Concrete experience was significantly related to 
connected knowing but primarily for men. However, men who scored lower on concrete 
experience had lower scores than female low-scorers on connected knowing. In other 
words, high concrete experience men had connected scores equal to women who scored 
higher on connected knowing regardless of learning style. The interaction of gender 
and concrete experience was a strong predictor of connected knowing, but only gender 
predicted separate knowing.
228 
Experiential Learning
These studies tracing development in women show that they tend to develop connected 
knowing in affective and perceptual complexity dimensions of the experiential learning 
theory developmental model (see Figure 6.3), while men develop separate knowing on 
symbolic and behavioral dimensions of integrative complexity though with considerable 
overlap between the genders and individual differences in profiles of the relative strength 
of the four modes.
Epistemological and Ontological Dimensions of Development
Piagetian inspired adult development models are epistemological; concerned with devel-
opmental differences in how one knows about oneself, the world, and their awareness of 
how they know. In “Is Epistemology Enough?” Vandenberg (1991) argues that theories 
based on epistemology fail to consider fundamental existential concerns such as the 
meaning of life and anxiety about death. This is particularly significant in the social world 
and in relationships with others who we know to be living beings who share these exis-
tential concerns. Disagreeing with Piaget’s claim that the reaction of intelligence to the 
social environment is “exactly parallel” to that of the physical environment, he suggests 
that our awareness of “being here” with fellow humans is fundamentally different. This 
suggests a different perspective on morality that goes beyond issues of rational judgment 
to existential issues of guilt and will and the freedom to choose to be moral (see Kolh-
berg’s theory of moral development below).
Ya-hui Su suggests that the epistemological approach to lifelong learning is focused on 
“having,” which is based on acquisition, storing, abstracting, and deferring rather than 
an ontological “being” approach of constructing, substantiating, and responding. “Life-
long learning as authentic being is not simply based on thought and action but must also 
concern willingness or affect. . . . Through the affective dimension. . . learners experience 
themselves as a willing cause of their own learning. When intuitive feeling is placed at the 
core of learning, a deeper, more primordial understanding is attained, where the learner 
and his or her world meet at the pre-conceptual level” (2011, p. 65). The experiential 
learning theory developmental model portrays both ontological and epistemological 
directions of development. Through being with direct concrete experiences, intuitive 
affective knowing occurs while through abstract conceptualization, generalized knowl-
edge is created. “Accordingly, experiential learning shapes people epistemologically and 
existentially” (Malinen 2000, p. 99).
Integration and Advanced Stages of Adult Development
In the experiential learning theory model of development the integrative phase  highlights 
the importance of integrating the multiple dimensions of development. The  transition 
from specialization to integration is a move from identification with a specialized 
approach to learning shaped by socialization into a particular career path that defines the 
229
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
self as its content: the abilities, knowledge, and values that it “has.” Integration, following 
Jung, brings the emergence of non-dominant approaches to learning into a holistic self-
fulfillment that identifies with the process of learning, not what is learned.
In contemporary constructive adult development research and theory this is described 
as a move from conventional to post-conventional stages of development. In the con-
ventional stages people are operating at Piaget’s stage of concrete and formal operations, 
conforming to the norms and values of their culture and context, introjecting these as 
their own with little self-conscious reflection and choice. In the post-conventional stages 
meaning-making becomes more reflective, choiceful, and voluntary, questioning beliefs 
and assumptions acquired during socialization.
At the time Experiential Learning was published, the major Piagetian adult develop-
ment theories—Loevinger’s ego development theory, Kegan’s subject-object theory, and 
Kohlberg’s moral development theory—all described the highest integrative stage of 
development as guided by internal, autonomous capacities for integrative reasoning and 
action—to choose responsibly one’s own social role and action. Contemporary construc-
tive adult development research and theory by these scholars and others has focused on 
still higher stages of adult development focusing on post-formal stages of development 
that move beyond the rational linear logic of formal operations to a holistic dialectic way 
of knowing that integrates experiencing and conceptualizing ways of knowing (Alexan-
der and Langer, 1990). While thought based on formal operations is dualistic, choosing 
one pole over another, post-formal thought is dialectic and holistic, where opposites are 
seen as poles of one concept that contains contradiction and paradox in movement and 
process. “This construction allows the self to see others and the self equally as expres-
sions of a larger community to which both belong. . . . No longer can cause and effect 
or two opposing sides of a conflict be identified within separable systems” (Souvaine, 
Lahey, and Kegan, 1990, p. 250; see also Basseches, 1984, 2005). The highest level of 
post-conventional stages of thought is consistent with the self-as-process integrative stage 
in experiential learning theory, while the lower stage based on formal operations is an 
integrative process at the experiential learning theory specialization stage.
Kolhberg’s 7 th Stage of Moral Development
The most dramatic example of the addition of a post-formal stage of development that 
goes beyond epistemological stages of knowing to a stage that integrates epistemologi-
cal and ontological perspectives is the seventh stage of moral development proposed by 
Kohlberg. This stage goes beyond his six-stage Piagetian stage model of moral develop-
ment that shows how individuals at increasing levels of maturity address the question of 
how to be moral. The six stages describe the progression from self-interest to conven-
tional morality to stage six where individuals rationally define their values and principles 
in a universal way. The framework, however, does not address the question of why one 
should be moral. Kohlberg goes on to say, “The answer to this question entails the  further 
230 
Experiential Learning
question, ‘Why live?’, thus, ultimate moral maturity requires a mature solution to the 
question of the meaning of life. This, in turn, is hardly a moral question per se; it is an 
ontological one. Not only is the question not a moral question, but it is a question not 
resolvable on purely logical or rational grounds, as moral questions are” (Kohlberg and 
Ryncarz, 1990, p. 192).
To address the ontological question, he proposes a seventh stage that involves experi-
encing in a non-egoistic and non-dualistic way that involves being part of the whole of 
life and nature with a cosmic perspective. He goes further, linking his seventh stage to 
Fowler’s (1981) highest stage of faith development, Universalizing Faith; suggesting that 
the correlation between stages of faith development and moral development shows the 
intertwining of the ontological and epistemological, the why and the how, operating at 
all levels of moral maturity.
Of the seventh stage he says it can be achieved temporarily, “such as when on a moun-
taintop or before the ocean. At such a time, what is ordinarily background becomes 
foreground and the self is no longer figure to the ground. We sense the unity of the whole 
and ourselves as part of that unity. . . one may argue that the crisis of despair precipitated 
by the recognition of one’s finite character from the perspective of the infinite, when 
thoroughly and courageously explored, leads to a figure-ground shift that reveals the 
positive validity of the cosmic perspective implicit in it” (Kohlberg and Ryncarz, 1990, 
pp. 193–195). What is particularly poignant about Kohlberg’s recognition of the ontologi-
cal dimension, and particularly this last sentence, is that it appears in his last publication 
before his suicide resulting from the chronic pain of an incurable disease. We can only 
hope that this seventh-stage awareness gave him peace and transcendence.
Kegan’s Subject Object Theory
Robert Kegan (1982, 1994; Kegan and Lahey, 2009) in the course of his career has defined 
and refined a five-stage theory of adult development that traces qualitative changes in 
how one makes meaning from experience in the cognitive affective, interpersonal, and 
intrapersonal realms. The system is an elegant and persuasive theory based on subject-
object relations that describes how the subjective framework in which one is embedded 
to view the object at one level becomes the object of a new more encompassing subjective 
framework at the next level. Kegan describes this growth as making what was subject into 
object so that we can “have it” rather than “be had” by it. Like Kohlberg, he describes a 
stage operating at the highest conventional formal operations level, which he calls “the 
self-authoring mind” (or modern mind), and a highest level stage, “the self-transforming 
mind” (or post-modern mind), that operates at the post-formal or post-conventional 
level.
The self-authoring mind describes individuals who see themselves as autonomous inde-
pendent selves who are responsible for their actions and in control of their lives. Operat-
231
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
ing in the formal operations stage they rationally analyze variables to determine cause 
and effect and solve problems. Kegan says these individuals “can coordinate, integrate, 
act upon or invent values, beliefs, convictions, generalizations, ideals, abstractions, inter-
personal loyalities and intrapersonal states. It is no longer authored by them, it authors 
them and thereby achieves a personal authority” (1994, p. 185). Cook-Greuter says of 
them, “It is no exaggeration to say that people with a formal operations worldview quite 
often look at life itself as a task to be accomplished or as a technical problem to be solved” 
(1999, p. 24). Weighing the pluses and minuses she says, “On one hand, symbol use and 
abstract thought have freed human being from direct experience of what is and thus allow 
for hypothetical reasoning and independent manipulation of mental objects. By reify-
ing and objectifying experience, humans exert a measure of control over their environ-
ment. On the other hand, formal operational thought is often perceived as inappropiately 
detached from feelings, overly abstract or ‘too much in the head.’ By only granting reality 
to rational, waking consciousness, it demotes whole realms of human experience to a 
lesser status” (1999, p. 28).
Baxter-Magolda advocates for the self-authoring mind as the foundation of higher 
education, “Twenty-first century learning outcomes require self-authorship: the 
internal capacity to define one’s belief system, identity and relationships” (2007, 
p. 69). Based on her extensive research, including a 21-year longitudinal study of 
young adults from ages 18 to 39 (2001), she has identified three components of self-
authorship—trusting one’s internal voice, building an internal foundation of beliefs, 
and securing internal commitments to strengthen personal identity (2008). The self-
authoring mind seems a good fit for the challenges of living in a highly individu-
alistic society such as the United States where responsibility for the course of one’s 
life including health care, retirement, and education is left to the individual; and, as 
Bruner pointed out, the developmental ideal itself gives justification for the policies 
that enact these systems.
Kegan’s self-transforming mind describes a qualitative development beyond the for-
mal operations of the self-authoring mind; a development that he sees as necessary to 
meet the challenges of the emerging post-modern world. The self-transforming mind 
is able to step back from the relatively closed system and self sufficient self-authored 
self and view it as one form of self-organization that is not necessarily complete or 
ultimate. It is more open to contradictions and other perspectives. It recognizes that 
any way of knowing when viewed from the point of view of another way is incom-
plete and flawed. It operates through dialectic reasoning where opposites are seen as 
one pole of a larger concept, as apprehension and comprehension are seen as poles of 
the transformation dimension in experiential learning theory. Identity lies not with 
a particular form but with transformation through the process of change itself. Rela-
tionships are a context for sharing and interacting in which both parties experience 
and share their multiplicity.
232 
Experiential Learning
Loevinger and Cook-Greuter’s Ego Development
Jane Loevinger’s (1976, 1993, 1998) theory of ego development encompasses nine 
stages—three at the pre-conventional level, three at the conventional level, and three at 
the post-conventional level—describing growth in maturity of the ego in impulse control, 
character development, interpersonal style, conscious preoccupations, and cognitive style 
that develop together. While based in psychoanalytic ego psychology, the developmental 
stages follow the logic of Piaget’s theory. Her highest stages based on formal operations are 
the individualistic and autonomous, while her integrated stage describing self-actualized 
persons with complex self-identities is not well-defined. For her the autonomous stage is 
the highest stage of development achieved by most people. This is probably because her 
approach emphasizes an empirical, as opposed to theoretical, methodology and very few 
people can be identified at the integrated level. Indeed, her system has a large body of 
empirical research using the Sentence Completion Test (SCT) which assesses the differ-
ent stages. Like Kegan’s self-authoring mind, the central issues at the autonomous stage 
are self-determination, self-actualization, and self-definition. They want to achieve their 
ideal self. They approach interpersonal relationships in an interdependent way and are 
able to control impulses to manage conflict.
Suzanne Cook-Greuter (1999) studied a sample of post-conventional SCT protocols 
from 440 SCTs scored over 17 years. Using this data she redefined the integrated stage 
into two stages, the construct aware and the unity. Individuals in the construct aware 
stage come to recognize their fundamental egocentricity as a limit on their growth and 
awareness, often perceiving the previous autonomous stage as self-centered and self-
important, while still yearning for a stable self-identity. Many have had peak experi-
ences where they witness themselves as experiencing beings. They come to see their 
concepts of the world as relative and arbitrary interpretations of the flow of experience 
and begin to embrace present, immediate experience as a way of knowing. In the 
unity stage individuals have a being orientation, let go of conscious mental activity, 
and immerse themselves in the immediate ongoing flow of experience. They see the 
permanent self and object world as illusory; everything is changing. Peak experiences 
are no longer rare but habitual ways of being. They have a universal perspective feeling 
themselves as part of the cosmos.
Rogers’ and Gendlin’s Process Conception of Growth
A fourth developmental model, written in 1956 before Piaget’s work was widely known 
in the United States, offers a contrast to the three Piaget inspired frameworks described 
above. Carl Rogers’ (1961, 1964) process conception of growth in psychotherapy, unlike 
those above that emphasize growth in cognitive meaning making, emphasizes growth in 
experiencing and its integration with conceptualization, as further developed by Gendlin 
233
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
(1961, 1962, 1978). It also differs in that the model is not linear but curvilinear, describing 
a process whereby the child’s pure experiencing process is blocked by the cultural intro-
jections of significant others only to emerge later as the person matures. For the adults he 
sees in therapy the process is about recapturing the child’s capacity to experience directly. 
The “continuum is from fixity to changingness, from rigid structure to flow, from stasis 
to process. . . it is unlikely that in one area of his life the client would exhibit complete 
fixity and in another area complete changingness. He would tend, as a whole, to be at 
some stage in the process” (Rogers, 1961, p. 131). He describes this as a process of “let-
ting oneself down into the immediacy of what one is experiencing, endeavoring to sense 
and to clarify all its complex meanings. . . the process is much more complex than it is in 
the infant. . . . For there is involved in the present moment of experiencing the memory 
traces of all the relevant learnings from the past. . . . Likewise the moment of experiencing 
contains, for the mature adult, hypotheses about consequences. . . . Past and future are 
both in this moment. . .” (Rogers, 1964, p. 164).
The two highest levels of Rogers’ (1961) experiencing process continuum directly paral-
lel the highest stages proposed by Kohlberg, Kegan, and Cook-Greuter. At stage six any 
present feeling is directly experienced with immediacy and richness. This immediacy of 
experiencing and the feeling which constitutes its content are accepted. This is something 
which is, not something to be denied, feared, struggled against. Self as object tends to 
disappear. The self at this moment, is the feeling. A physiological loosening accompanies 
this process type of experiencing. Any relevant personal construct is dissolved in the 
experiencing moment and as one feels loose from his previously stabilized framework. . . 
there are no longer “problems,” external or internal. The person is living subjectively, a 
phase of his problem. It is not an object. The best description seems to be that he neither 
perceives his problem nor deals with it, but is simply living some portion of it knowingly 
and acceptingly.
At stage seven new feelings are coming into awareness and are experienced with imme-
diacy and richness of detail both in the therapeutic relationship and in the outside. There 
is a growing sense of acceptant ownership of these changing feelings, a basic trust in one’s 
own inward process. This trust is not primarily in the conscious process which goes on, 
but rather in the total organismic process. Experiencing has lost almost completely its 
structure-bound aspects and becomes pure process experiencing—that is the situation is 
experienced and interpreted in its newness, not as the past. The self becomes increasingly 
simply the subjective and reflexive awareness of experiencing, is much less frequently a 
perceived object, . . . and much more frequently something felt in the process. Personal 
constructs, after disappearing, are tentatively reformulated, to be submitted to validation 
against further experience, but even then to be held loosely. Internal communication is 
clear with feelings and symbols well matched; there is an experiencing of effective choice 
of new ways of thinking . . . and a sensing of a possibility of an effective choice.

Experiential Learning
Implications for Experiential Learning Theory  
Development Theory
I chose in the experiential learning theory developmental model to define three broad 
stages of life—acquisition, specialization, and integration—based on Jung’s theory of 
development toward individuation and Werner’s orthogenetic principle that describes 
development as proceeding from an embedded lack of differentiation to a state of increas-
ing differentiation and articulation to hierarchic integration. These stages parallel the 
pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional phases of the adult development 
models described above. The above adult development models define two clear and 
consistent levels in the integrative stage; the autonomous self-authoring self and the inte-
grating processual self. The theorists have developed marvelously meticulous qualitative 
scoring systems to reliably describe these developmental stages.
Yet their claims of a hierarchy of stages, however compelling they are theoretically, are 
problematic in a number of respects. The standards necessary to prove these stage mod-
els impose a pretty high bar. Loevinger herself states, “There is an underlying assump-
tion that the types found in adult life represent the trace of developmental stages. This 
assumption is not easily subject to proof” (1993, pp. 6–7).
Hard, Soft, and Functional Stages
Flavell (1971) argues that to define a stage change more than just a couple of discrete 
variables must differ between stages; the stages must differ as a holistic system of cogni-
tive organization that is qualitatively, not quantitatively, different. It must be an abrupt 
jump to proficiency in the higher stage for all aspects of the total system. Kohlberg and 
his colleagues have suggested that there are functional, hard, and soft stages that differ 
in how well they meet these criteria (Alexander and Langer, 1990, p. 159). Only hard 
stages meet Flavell’s criteria, being developmental sequences that reorganize cognitive 
frameworks universally.
Kohlberg and Ryncarz argue that soft stages are optional, not necessary, tracks of devel-
opment. “Movement in these stages is an option for individuals who are induced by their 
own personalities and a life circumstance into those forms of reflection on life’s mean-
ing that soft stages represent” (1990, p. 204). While hard stages involve only an abstract 
epistemic subject, soft stage theories involve a concept of the self and self-awareness, a 
psychological concept that is at present not well-developed compared to cognitive func-
tioning. They argue that Kohlberg’s seventh stage of post-formal development is a soft 
stage of reflective meaning making, unlike the formal six stages that precede it. Func-
tional stages are environmentally influenced, referring to stages that emerge to perform 
new tasks or functions.
235
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
The experiential learning theory developmental stages by this analysis are soft or func-
tional stages determined by one’s individual life course. For example, the studies of 
accountants and engineers described in Experiential Learning (Chapter 7, pp. 272–273) 
suggest that movement from specialization to integration for individuals in these two 
professions is influenced by changes in their work roles. Engineers, who remain in tech-
nical jobs, for example, retain their specialized converging learning style and skills while 
those who move into management integrate these skills with a more accommodating 
style and skills. As described previously (Chapter 2 Update and Reflections), develop-
ment occurs not as an isolated, internal individual process, but through the spiraling of 
the learning cycle in the co-evolution of mutually transforming transactions between 
ourselves and the world around us.
Is Up the Only Way?
Stages models are unidirectional indicating hierarchical integration of increasing com-
plexity; requiring an explicit logic of what makes one position higher and more mature 
than another (Noam, 1993, p. 45). Kegan and colleagues show admirable humility at 
the difficulty of this task, “. . . the plausibility of an argument for a post-formal state also 
casts a shadow on the likelihood of unexceptional people like ourselves to describe with 
anything approaching completeness the systematicity of that state. . . Since. . . we spend 
the vast majority of our lives embedded in the formal-operational rational systems. . . The 
authors come by their modesty honestly” (Souvaine, Lahey, and Kegan, 1990, p. 230). 
Others in the field are more comfortable in claming the superiority of higher stages. 
Loevinger claims that “people can understand thinking at their own level or at levels 
below their own, but not at levels above their own” (1998, p. 33). Cook-Greuter seems 
to agree, “Paradoxically, these rarer perspectives on life produce types of knowledge that 
are incomprehensible to those who have not themselves asked the epistemological ques-
tions and experienced the self-transformations occurring in this inquiry process” (1999, 
pp. 1–2).
The claim may or may not be true, but it nonetheless produces uncomfortable claims 
of superiority by those who see themselves at higher levels of maturity. My social con-
structionist and critical theorist friends often speak of physical scientists operating in the 
formal operations stage as “modernists,” “positivists,” “realists,” “empiricists,” “reduction-
ists,” and the like implying a somewhat lower form of thought that just doesn’t “get it.” 
My physical and natural science friends, to the extent that they pay any attention to this 
“post-modern” stuff at all, say that the social constructionists just don’t know what they 
are talking about when they dismiss logical empiricism and reductionism. My own view 
is that of Stephen Pepper (Chapter 5) and Stephen J. Gould (2003) who see the two modes 
of inquiry as co-equal and complementary—qualitatively different ways of knowing.
236 
Experiential Learning
The unilinear and unidirectional assumption of the models must also be questioned for its 
upward orientation. Developmental advances are seen as higher, more all-encompassing 
abstractions that release us from our embeddedness in the ground and grind of daily 
existence. Yet Gilligan’s refinement of Kohlberg’s model introduces an ethic of care and 
compassion that more appropriately seems like a downward embracing of the cares and 
concerns of others. Mother Theresa’s Total Surrender (1993) is a testament to this ideal 
of downward development. Cook-Greuter (2000) has recently proposed a modification 
in the ego development model suggesting that it is not an upward and linear progression 
but curvilinear. Early development from the preconventional through the conventional 
stage of conscientiousness is an upward separation from the ground of being, while 
post-coventional development is a return to the ground with higher awareness or con-
scious unity. This is similar to Rogers’ curvilinear model of development in experiencing 
described previously.
Stages or States?
In recent years we have begun to depart from stage models of development to a view 
that recognizes the states described by the stage models but sees these states as modes of 
adaptation that are not necessarily hierarchical. Differentiation and integration are not 
primarily broad life stages but continuous processes of development occurring through-
out life. Working with many hundreds of individuals over the years we have received 
pushback on the hierarchical stages of development, particularly from younger students 
who ask why they can’t be at the integrative stage at their age. In some cases, when we 
talked with them in depth, it seemed that their primary concerns were developmental 
and holistic rather than specialized. Recently millennial’s have suggested that their gen-
eration in general frequently operates at the integrative developmental level. Richard 
Boyatzis and I (Boyatzis and Kolb, 1999) have redefined the three stages as modes of 
adaptation that differ in their framing of time and space. Performance is an adaptive 
mode of learning confined to immediate time/space situations, while the learning mode 
extends the time/space frame to include similar specialized environments. The develop-
ment mode extends to the total lifespan and all life situations. Individuals may be in any 
one of these modes at varying times and situations in their life driven by personal choice 
or the challenges of context.
Applied to the current focus on stages of integrative development, viewing the autono-
mous self-authoring and integrating processual selves as modes of adaptation that are 
states rather than stages recognizes that these states are determined partially by culture, 
context, and one’s life situation. For example, Nisbett, Peng, Choi, and Norenzayan (2001) 
found that East Asians tend to be holistic in their cognition like the integrating proces-
sual self, while Westerners are more analytic in their cognition like the autonomous 
self-authoring self.
237
Chapter 6 The Experiential Learning Theory of Development 
Such states may be more prevalent in the population than the low frequency of occur-
rence of higher stages in Kegan and Loevinger’s work, which are defined by the stringent 
criteria for a stage described earlier. Cook-Grueter (1999, 2000) estimates that about 
10 percent of adults are in the pre-conventional stages, 80 percent are in the conventional 
stages, and 10 percent are in the post-conventional stages. Less than 1 percent of Kegan’s 
(2009) sample achieve the highest level of self-transforming mind, and fewer than 2 per-
cent score in Cook-Greuter’s construct aware and unitive stages (Loevinger’s integrated 
stage).
They also may be subject to deliberate development and flexible adaptation to meet 
different situational challenges (see Chapter 8 Update and Reflections). Langer and 
colleagues suggest that adult development models have a conservative view of change, 
“There is too easy an understanding of what the next stage is going to be. ‘Development’ 
is perceived as a time dependent continuity where the articulation of later stages ‘follows 
through’ from participation in earlier stages. And there is all too definite an idea of what 
stages and possibilities lie ahead as persons make their way through development” (Alex-
ander and Langer, 1990, pp. 135–136). Temporary states like Kohlberg’s unity experience 
on the mountaintop may prove beneficial for gaining a new perspective on the life chal-
lenges we face and may be helpful in framing effective action.

Learning and Development  
in Higher Education
. . . the ways in which we believe and expect have a tremendous  effect 
on what we believe and expect. We have discovered at last that these 
ways are set, almost abjectly so, by social factors, by  tradition and the 
influence of education. Thus we discover that we believe many things not 
because the things are so but because we have become habituated through 
the weight of authority, by  imitation, prestige, institution, and uncon-
scious effect of language, etc. We learn, in short, that  qualities which we 
 attribute to objects ought to be imputed to our ways of  experiencing them, 
and that these in turn are due to the force of  intercourse and custom. This 
discovery marks an emancipation; it  purifies and remakes the  objects of 
our direct or primary experience.
—John Dewey, Experience and Nature
F
rom the perspective of experiential learning theory, educational institutions are 
the curators of social knowledge. Chief among the responsibilities of their cura-
torship is the creation of conditions whereby social knowledge is made accessible 
to individual learners for their development. Jerome Bruner has underscored the impor-
tance of this task:
Perhaps the task of converting knowledge into a form fit for transmission is, 
after all, the final step in our codification of knowledge. Perhaps the task is to 
go beyond the learned scholarship, scientific research, and the exercise of dis-
ciplined sensibility in the arts to the transmission of what we have discovered. 
Surely no culture will reach its full potential unless it invents ever better means 
for doing so. [Bruner, 1971, p. 19]
240 
Experiential Learning
This responsibility includes the individual development of participants in these insti-
tutions in all three developmental stages of experiential learning: (1) acquisition, the 
preparation of individual learners in basic skills so that they can access and utilize the 
tools of social knowledge; (2) specialization, the selection and socialization of learners 
into specialized areas of knowledge that suit their talents and meet societal needs; and 
(3) integration, the development of the unique capabilities of the whole person toward 
creativity, wisdom, and integrity. The first of these responsibilities has traditionally been 
the province of primary and secondary education, although the increased knowledge 
necessary to function effectively in modern society, coupled with the general decline in 
the public educational system, has caused considerable overflow of this responsibility into 
the system of higher education.
The third educational responsibility of integrative fulfillment has for many years been 
suffering at the expense of the second, specialized occupational training. The selection 
of Charles Eliot as president of Harvard in 1869 marked the end of classical education 
in American colleges whereby all students took the same courses in Greek, Latin, and 
mathematics. By introducing electives and “majors” in the Harvard curriculum, he 
began what, considering the rapid growth of knowledge, was the inevitable specializa-
tion and fragmentation that characterizes the modern university. In the system that 
has emerged in the last 100 years, students have been increasingly free to select their 
courses and to define programs suited to their needs, interests, and abilities. Academic 
disciplines have enjoyed a corresponding freedom to choose those students who best fit 
their requirements. This trend toward specialization and vocationalism in higher edu-
cation has recently gained momentum from post-“baby-boom” demographics, a tight 
job market, and the multifaceted financial crises of institutions of higher learning. Col-
lege and universities are thus increasingly specialized and fragmented, held together 
by little more than Robert Hutchins’s central heating system, Warren Bennis’s parking 
authority, and a few distribution requirements. In a highly complex and specialized 
society, the pressures toward specialization in education feed on themselves. Higher 
education is increasingly called upon to deliver the specialized knowledge, skills, and 
attitudes needed for students to find their niche in society, and to service that niche 
as well. Institutions, in turn, become increasingly dependent on these “social niches” 
for their own survival, and lend further support to the forces of knowledge specializa-
tion, usually at the expense of integrative education. Speaking of the specialized formal 
educational requirements required for entry in occupations, Robert Hutchins said:
The great bulk of the students in American universities are there in order to meet 
these requirements. The public acquiesces in them, first, because it is accustomed 
to acquiesce in the demands of pressure groups, and second because it has a 
vague feeling that the members of certain occupations at least should be certified, 
or sanctified, in some way before they are let loose upon the public. The public is 
unwilling, often for good reasons, to trust these occupations to certify their own 
241
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
members. The universities acquiesce in these arrangements because they wish 
to increase their enrollments; students bring in income, and anyway there is a 
general feeling that excellence in educational institutions, as in most other things, 
increases in proportion to size. The trades, occupations, businesses, and profes-
sions promote these arrangements in order to restrict competition and enhance 
their prestige. [Hutchins, 1953, p. 31]
Before we return to a consideration of integrative development, it is important to under-
stand first the consequences of this specialized emphasis of higher education on student 
learning and development. In considering the student careers that are spawned and 
shaped in the university community and the university’s responsibility for the intellec-
tual, moral, and personal development of its members, we have often emphasized the 
unitary linear trend of human growth and development at the expense of acknowledging 
and managing the diverse developmental pathways that exist within different disciplines 
and professions. These paths foster some developmental achievements and, as we shall 
see, inhibit others. The channels of academic specialization are swift and deep, the way 
between them tortuous and winding. Many years ago, I served as a freshman advisor 
to undergraduates in a technological university. Two or three of my students in each 
group faced the awkward realization near the end of their freshman year that a career 
in engineering was not quite what they had imagined it to be. What to do? Transfer to a 
liberal arts school and possibly lose the prestige of a technological education? Endure the 
institute’s technological requirements and “bootleg” a humanities major? Switch to man-
agement? Most decided to wait and see, but with a distinct loss of energy and increase in 
confusion. I felt powerless about what to advise or even how to advise.
It was only later that I was to discover that these shifts represented something more 
fundamental than changing interests—that they stemmed in many cases from fun-
damental mismatches between personal learning styles and the learning demands of 
different disciplines. That disciplines incline to different styles of learning is evident 
from the variations among their primary tasks, technologies, and products, criteria 
for academic excellence and productivity, teaching methods, research methods, and 
methods for recording and portraying knowledge. Disciplines, as we have seen, show 
sociocultural variation—differences in faculty and student demographics, personality, 
and aptitudes, as well as differences in values and group norms. For students, educa-
tion in an academic field is a continuing process of selection and socialization to the 
pivotal norms of the field governing criteria for truth and how it is to be achieved, com-
municated, and used, and secondarily, to peripheral norms governing personal styles, 
attitudes, and social relationships. Over time, these selection and socialization pres-
sures combine to produce an increasingly impermeable and homogeneous disciplinary 
culture and correspondingly specialized student orientations to learning. This chapter 
will explore the dynamics of this specialized developmental process in undergraduate 
and professional education.
242 
Experiential Learning
Specialized Development and the Process of Accentuation
The major developmental dynamic in specialized education is the selection and social-
ization of students into specialized areas of social knowledge commensurate with their 
interests and talents. This development takes place through a process of accentuation. In 
their comprehensive review of the effect of college on students, Feldman and Newcomb 
describe the accentuation process as it affects the college experience:
Whatever the characteristics of an individual that selectively propel him toward 
particular educational settings—going to college, selecting a particular one, 
choosing a certain academic major, acquiring membership in a particular group 
of peers—these same characteristics are apt to be reinforced and extended by the 
experiences incurred in those settings. [Feldman and Newcomb, 1969, p. 333]
Thus, if students with a particular learning style choose a field whose knowledge struc-
ture is one that prizes and nurtures their style of learning, then accentuation of that 
approach to learning is likely to occur. The result is an educational system that empha-
sizes specialized learning and development through the accentuation of the students’ 
skills and interests. Students’ developmental pathways are a product of the interaction 
between their choices and socialization experiences in academic fields such that choice 
dispositions lead them to choose educational experiences that match these dispositions, 
and the resulting experiences further reinforce the same choice disposition for later 
experiences.
Some examples will serve to illustrate this process of specialization in learning style as 
a result of accentuation. In a first attempt to examine the details of this process, Plov-
nick (1971) studied a major university department using the concept of convergence 
and divergence defined by Hudson (1966). He concluded that the major emphasis in 
physics education was on convergent learning. He predicted that physics students who 
had convergent learning styles would be content with their majors, whereas physics 
majors who were divergent in their learning styles would be more uncertain of physics 
as a career and would take more courses outside the physics department than would 
their convergent colleagues. His predictions were confirmed. Those students who were 
not fitted for the convergent learning style required in physics tended to turn away 
from physics as a profession, while those physics students having a convergent style 
tended to continue to specialize in physics, both in their course choices and their career 
choices.
In another unpublished study, we examined the accentuation process as it operated at 
the molecular level of course choice. This research examined the choice of sensitivity 
training by graduate students in management. When we gathered the Learning Style 
Inventory (LSI) scores of students who chose a voluntary sensitivity-training laboratory, 
we found that they tended to be more concrete and reflective than those who chose not 
243
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
to attend the lab. When those with divergent learning styles completed the training ses-
sions, their LSI scores became even more concrete and reflective on a post-test, accentu-
ating their disposition toward divergent learning experiences.1
Witkin and his associates (Witkin, 1976) have shown that global (field-dependent) stu-
dents choose specializations that favor involvement with people—such as teaching, sales, 
management, and the humanities—whereas analytical (field-independent) students 
choose areas that favor analysis, such as the physical sciences, engineering, and technical 
and mechanical activities. Clinical-psychology graduate students tend to be global, and 
experimental-psychology graduate students are analytical. In addition, Witkin found 
that when cognitive style matches the demands of a given career specialization, higher 
performance results.
It is important to note not only that the content of choices is associated with cognitive 
style, but also that there is an association between the choice process and cognitive style. 
Thus, global students make choices preferred by their peer group, whereas analytical stu-
dents are more likely to use systematic planning and goal setting. Plovnick (1974) found 
a similar pattern when he used the LSI to study medical students’ choice of medical spe-
cialty. There were significant relationships between the LSI scores and specific choices 
made: accommodators chose medicine and family care; assimilators chose academic 
medicine; divergers chose psychiatry; and convergers chose medical specialties. In addi-
tion, LSI scores were related to the process of choosing: concrete students tended to base 
their choices on role models and acquaintances, abstract students relied on theoretical 
material and interest in subject matter.
1.  Another set of questions is raised by the choice/experience cycle in development. Although the results 
of these studies show that the majority of students seem to be involved in a series of choices and experi-
ences that accentuate their learning-style tendencies, many students deviate from this dominant trend. 
If we are to understand the role of learning styles in the development process, we need to understand 
not only dominant trends but also the causes for deviation from these trends. More specifically, we may 
gain from this kind of analysis more insight into the relative importance of choices and experiences in 
human change and development. Until now, much emphasis has been placed on the primary importance 
of experience as the cause of change. This orientation has given rise to countless research studies seeking 
to measure with before-after change measurements the effects of various educational experiences. But 
suppose that a person was changed as much by his choices of experiences as by the experiences them-
selves. Take, for example, a person interested in mathematics. His interests and aptitudes in mathematics 
may lead him to seek educational experiences that will enhance these dispositions. In addition, he may 
be screened formally and informally for admission to this educational program, gaining entry only if he 
has mathematical aptitude. Thus, by the time his choice has been realized, he will already (1) have gone 
through a process of consciously recognizing an aspect of himself that he wanted to develop (i.e., his 
mathematical ability); (2) have done some planning about how to develop this aspect; and (3) perhaps 
have begun learning mathematics in order to pass selection tests. All these processes will have occurred 
before the "before" measurement in the typical study designed to assess the effects of an educational 
experience. Yet they may be as important in determining the directions of development.
244 
Experiential Learning
Robert Altmeyer (1966) has dramatically illustrated the result of the accentuation pro-
cess on cognitive abilities in his comparative study of engineering/science and fine-arts 
students at Carnegie Tech. In a cross-sectional study, he administered two batteries of 
tests to students at all levels in the two schools; one battery measured analytical reason-
ing, the other creative thinking. As predicted, engineering/science students scored high-
est on analytic reasoning and fine-arts students highest on creative thinking; and over the 
college years, these gaps widened: engineering/science students became more analytical 
and fine-arts students more creative. The surprising finding was that engineering/sci-
ence students decreased in creative thinking and fine-arts students decreased in analytic 
reasoning over the college years. Thus, educational processes that accentuated one set 
of cognitive skills also appeared to produce loss of ability in the contrasting set of skills.
The corollary to the accentuation process of development in which skills and environ-
mental demands are increasingly matched is the alienation cycle that results when per-
sonal characteristics find no supportive environment to nurture them. In this emerging 
information society, severe alienation can result when there is an incongruity between 
personal knowledge and social knowledge. This is illustrated most dramatically by the 
alienation of the poor, whose streetwise way of learning doesn’t fit with the symbolic/tech-
nological knowledge of the university; or more subtly, it is illustrated by the creative writer 
who is “turned off” by the pedantic critical climate of her English literature department, 
or the adult who returns to college and finds little recognition for a lifetime of learning  
by experience.
Undergraduate Student Development  
in a Technological University
Thus far we have seen that experiential learning theory characterizes differences in the 
learning/inquiry norms of different academic fields and that student development and 
learning are shaped by these fields through a process of accentuation. To examine in 
greater detail the role of student learning styles in the educational process and to explore 
the consequences of matches and mismatches between learning styles and the knowledge 
structure of academic disciplines, let us now examine a case study of undergraduate stu-
dents in a well-known technological university (TECH).2
Data for the study (except for cumulative grade averages, which were obtained from 
the registrar’s office) were collected by means of a questionnaire that was sent to the 
720 TECH seniors two months before graduation. Four hundred and seven students 
(57 percent) responded to the questionnaire. Of these responses, 342 (43 percent) were 
complete enough to test the hypotheses in this study. The questionnaire included the

Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
Learning Style Inventory, two scales measuring political alienation and anomie, ques-
tions about plans for next year, career choice, degree of commitment to that career, 
undergraduate major, perception of academic workload, and involvement with peers. 
These variables will be described in detail as the results are presented.
Figure 7.1 shows the LSI scores of students with different departmental majors in those 
departments with ten or more students. Analysis of variance for the six learning-style 
dimensions by departmental major shows that reflective observation, active experimen-
tation, and the combination score active-reflective all vary significantly by departmental 
major. Differences on the abstract-concrete dimensions show no significance. This lack 
of significant differentiation may well be because of more uniform selective and norma-
tive pressures toward abstraction that operate across all the university departments. 
TECH’s reputation as a scientific institution is strongly based on scholarship and the 
advancement of scientific knowledge. Humanities, architecture, and management are 
the most concrete departments in the university, and our observations would indicate 
that these are all quite scholarly in comparison with more concrete programs in other, 
less “academic” schools such as fine arts, drafting, or business administration. Selective 
and normative forces on the active-reflective dimension are more diverse, representing 
the tension in the university between basic science and practical application. With the

exception of electrical engineering, the engineering departments are the most active in 
the university. With the exception of chemistry, the basic sciences and mathematics are 
more reflective.
When the pattern of relationships among departments at TECH is compared with the 
Carnegie Commission data representing colleges and universities of all types (Figure 
5.4), one is immediately struck by the fact that with the exception of architecture and 
humanities, the concrete disciplines in Figure 5.4 are not represented at this university 
(there are philosophy, political science, and psychology departments, but they had only 
two or three students each in our sample). Otherwise, there is a general correspon-
dence with previous studies. Humanities falls in the diverger quadrant, mathematics 
is assimilative, and management is clearly accommodative. Although the engineering 
departments all fall on the lower edge of the accommodator quadrant rather than the 
converger quadrant as predicted, this is most likely a function of the general abstract 
bias of the university as a whole. Physics and chemistry are not as abstract and reflec-
tive as predicted, although if the LSI scores of only those students planning to attend 
graduate school are used (as indicated by the arrowheads in Figure 7.1), the pattern 
is more consistent with prediction. Economics is somewhat more abstract and active 
than the Carnegie data, although, as we will describe later, this is probably a function 
of the unique nature of the TECH department. The architecture department’s position 
in the divergent quadrant is also to some extent a function of the unique nature of the 
department, with its emphasis on creative design and photography as well as the more 
convergent technical skills of architecture.
Learning Styles and Career Choice
Figure 7.1 gives an indication about career paths of the students in each of the depart-
ments. The arrowheads indicate for each department the average LSI scores for those 
students who are planning to attend graduate school. We would predict that those who 
choose to pursue a given discipline further through graduate training should show an 
accentuation of the learning style characteristic of that discipline. That is, the arrows for 
those departments falling in the accommodative quadrant should point toward the con-
crete and active extremes of the LSI grid, the arrows for divergent departments toward the 
concrete and reflective, the arrows for the assimilative departments toward the abstract 
and reflective, and the arrows for the convergent departments toward abstract and active 
extremes of the LSI grid. The actual results are not so clear-cut. Chemical engineering, 
mechanical engineering, management, humanities, mathematics, and economics all show 
in varying degrees the predicted accentuation pattern. Potential graduate students in 
chemistry, civil engineering, and electrical engineering score in the convergent quadrant 
rather than becoming more accommodative. Architecture, biology, and earth science 
potential graduate students move toward the convergent rather than becoming more 
divergent. Physics moves into the assimilative quadrant.

Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
The results above should be viewed as only suggestive, since several measurement prob-
lems prevented a more accurate test of the accentuation hypothesis. The first problem 
was that it was difficult to determine whether or not a mathematics student planning 
graduate work in artificial intelligence would continue studying mathematics. Even 
though most students clearly planned graduate training in the field of their major, the 
few borderline cases do contaminate the results. A second measurement problem lies in 
the fact that graduate study in general for TECH students is associated with an abstract 
and active orientation. Since all six of the departments that did not follow the accentua-
tion prediction showed a tendency toward abstractness, and four of the six showed a 
tendency toward the active orientation, this general tendency for graduate study may 
well have overshadowed the accentuation process in those departments. The final mea-
surement problem has to do with the prediction of learning demands for those depart-
ments like electrical engineering whose students score close to the middle of the LSI grid.
To deal with these problems in the measurement of the accentuation process, four 
departments were selected for more intensive case study. Several criteria were used to 
choose departments whose learning-style demands matched the four dominant learning 
styles. The first criterion used the average learning-style scores of the students in a given 
department as an indicator of the learning-style requirements of that department. This 
criterion assumes that on the average, students will over their college careers select them-
selves and be selected into fields that match their learning styles. The criterion clearly 
identified three TECH departments that matched three of the learning types—humani-
ties was divergent in its learning demands, mathematics was assimilative, and economics 
was convergent (see Figure 7.1).
The fourth department that was ultimately chosen, mechanical engineering, was accom-
modative but was not clearly different from other departments in the accommodative 
quadrant. To pick the most representative accommodative department, three other cri-
teria were applied. The first was to pick a department whose students going to graduate 
school showed an accentuation of the departmental learning style. Three departments in 
the accommodative quadrant showed this accentuation process—chemical engineering, 
mechanical engineering, and management—as did the three departments already chosen 
to represent the other styles. Of these three accommodative departments, chemical engi-
neering seemed most representative, but we had to eliminate it because all but two of the 
students in the department had accommodative learning styles. This made impossible 
comparisons between students who matched the departmental norms and those who did 
not. The other candidate, management, was eliminated because a closer examination of 
students in that department showed that it comprised two separate and distinct groups: 
behavioral-science and management/computer-science majors. Thus, students would 
not be reacting to a single set of departmental learning-style demands.
As a final check, the educational objectives and curricula of the four departments selected 
by the criteria above were examined for indications of their learning-style demands. 
248 
Experiential Learning
Humanities and mathematics showed strong indications of divergent and assimilative 
orientations, respectively, as our previous data and theory would predict. For example, 
course descriptions in humanities often emphasize “different perspectives” of a literary 
work. In mathematics, the emphasis is on basic theory and research, as this quote from 
the TECH Bulletin’s description of the undergraduate mathematics program indicates:
The immediate educational aims are to provide an understanding of a substantial 
part of the existing body of mathematical knowlede and an ability to impart this 
knowledge to others. But most important, the department hopes to inspire a 
deep interest in the discovery or invention of new mathematics or interpretation 
of mathematics to a new field.
By indication of the learning styles of its students, the economics department at TECH 
is considerably more convergent—abstract and active—than economics majors in our 
previous research (Kolb, 1973). This convergent emphasis is borne out, however, by 
the objectives and curricula of the department. The department places a very strong 
emphasis on the quantitative/theoretical and policy-formation aspects of economics and 
considerably less on the more liberal-arts approach (for example, economic history).
Although our previous work showed that engineers on the average fall in the conver-
gent quadrant of the LSI, we were able to obtain no differentiation among the various 
forms of engineering. One advantage of studying a technical institute like TECH is that 
we can begin to differentiate among these types. One would expect, for example, that 
mechanical engineering, with its relatively small theory base, would be more concrete 
than electrical engineering, where theory plays a larger role. The concrete orientation 
of mechanical engineering can be illustrated by the following quote, excerpted from the 
TECH Bulletin description of undergraduate study in mechanical engineering:
. . . the student must experience the ways in which scientific knowledge can be 
put to use in the development and design of useful devices and processes. To 
teach this art, largely by project-oriented work of creative nature, is the primary 
object of subjects in laboratory and design.
To study the career choices of the students in the four departments, we used each stu-
dent’s LSI scores to position him/her on the LSI grid with a notation of the career field 
he/she had chosen to pursue after graduation. If the student was planning to attend 
graduate school, the career field was circled (the results of this analysis are shown in 
Figures 7.2 through 7.5). If the accentuation process were operating in the career choices 
of the students, we should find that those students who fall in the same quadrant as the 
norms of their academic major should be more likely to pursue careers and graduate 
training directly related to that major, while students with learning styles that differ from 
their discipline norms should be more inclined to pursue other careers and not attend 
graduate school in their discipline. Although the sample size is small and most students

plan some form of mechanical-engineering career, this career-choice pattern can be 
seen in the mechanical-engineering department (Figure 7.2). All four of the students in 
the accommodator quadrant (100 percent) plan careers in mechanical engineering and 
graduate training as well. Only four of the ten students (40 percent) whose learning styles 
do not fit mechanical engineering are committed both to straight engineering careers 
and graduate training. The pattern is more clear in the mathematics department, where 
we have a somewhat larger sample (Figure 7.3). Ten of the thirteen mathematics stu-
dents (80 percent) whose learning styles are congruent with departmental norms choose 
careers and graduate training in mathematics. Only two of the thirteen students (15 
percent) whose learning styles are not congruent plan both careers and graduate training 
in math (these differences are significant using the Fisher Exact Test, p < .01). Figure 7.4 
shows the same trend in the economics department, although to a lesser degree. Three 
of the six economics students (50 percent) with congruent learning styles plan graduate 
training and careers in economics, but only one of the six (17 percent) with different 
learning styles has such plans.
The pattern in the humanities department (Figure 7.5) is somewhat more difficult to 
interpret. One is immediately struck by the fact that only three of the eleven students 
(27 percent) in the humanities department plan to attend graduate school. This is 
in contrast to the fact that 63 percent of all TECH seniors plan graduate training. In 
addition, all of the humanities students’ career choices are somewhat related to the 
humanities but are definitely unrelated to the core curricula of TECH. In this sense, 
the humanities department as a whole seems not to fit with the learning demands of 
the rest of the institution. The concrete/reflective orientation of humanities seems in 
conflict with the abstract and active orientation of a technical school. We will explore 
this hypothesis further in the next section of results on performance and adjustment 
at TECH.
To further test the accentuation process in the four departments, we examined whether 
the student’s choice-experience career-development cycle, indeed, operated as an accen-
tuating positive feedback loop. If this were so, then those students whose learning-style 
dispositions matched and were reinforced by their discipline demands should show a 
greater commitment to their choice of future career field than those whose learning styles 
were not reinforced by their experiences in their discipline. As part of the questionnaire, 
students were asked to rate how important it was for them to pursue their chosen career 
field. They expressed their answers on a 1-5 scale, where 5 equaled “great importance.” 
The average ratings for students whose learning styles matched discipline demands and 
those whose styles did not match the norms of their discipline are shown for the four 
departments in Figure 7.6. In all four departments, the average importance rating was 
higher for the students with a match between learning style and discipline norms (the 
differences being statistically significant in the mechanical-engineering and econom-
ics departments). Thus, it seems that learning experiences that reinforce learning-style

dispositions tend to produce greater commitment in career choices than those learning 
experiences that do not reinforce learning-style dispositions.
Taken as a whole, these data present enticing, if not definitive, evidence that career 
choices tend to follow a path toward accentuation of one’s specialized approach to learn-
ing. Learning experiences congruent with learning styles tend to positively influence the 
choice of future learning and work experiences that reinforce that particular learning 
style. On the other hand, those students who find a learning environment incongruent 
with their learning styles tend to move away from that kind of environment in future 
learning and work choices.

Learning Styles, Academic Performance, and Adaptation  
to the University
The final question to be explored in this research study was whether a student’s learning 
style was an important determinant of social adaptation and performance in the univer-
sity. To answer this, we compared, on a number of variables, the students whose learn-
ing styles fit their discipline demands with the students whose learning styles did not 
fit in the four departments mentioned above. To begin with, student cumulative grade 
averages were examined (see Figure 7.7). The mechanical-engineering and economics 
departments both showed results consistent with predictions; accommodative students

in mechanical engineering had higher grades (p < .10) than mechanical-engineering stu-
dents with other learning styles, and convergent students in economics had much higher 
grades (p < .001) than economics students with other learning styles. In the mathematics 
department, however, there was no difference between the two groups of students, and in 
humanities, the six students whose learning style was not divergent had somewhat higher 
grades. Although the humanities department results represent a reversal of our original 
prediction, they offer further evidence for the hypothesis that humanities and the diver-
gent learning style associated with it are incongruent with the abstract and active norms 
of TECH as a whole. This latter hypothesis would suggest that humanities students who 
are not divergers should perform better academically.
The same pattern of results is found when another aspect of academic performance, stu-
dent perceptions of how heavy the academic workload is, is examined (see Figure 7.8).

257
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
Students rated their perception of academic workload on a 1-5 scale, where 1 equaled 
“very great” and 5 equaled “light.” In mechanical engineering, mathematics, and eco-
nomics, those students whose learning styles were congruent with their discipline norms 
felt the workload to be lighter than did those students whose learning styles did not 
“fit.” (Statistical significance levels in mathematics and economics are p < .05 and p 
< .10 respectively.) Again, the humanities department showed a trend in the opposite 
direction.
Mismatches between learning styles and discipline demands are apt to affect a student’s 
social adaptation to the university. An incongruence between a student’s learning style 
and the norms of his or her major might well undermine feelings of belonging to the 
university community and alienate him or her from the power structure (faculty and 
administration). To test these hypotheses, we used a version of Olsen’s political alien-
ation scale (1969) and McCloskey and Schaar’s anomie scale (1963) that were adapted 
to apply specifically to the TECH environment (see Kolb, Rubin, and Schein, 1972, 
for complete details of these scales). These scales measure two uncorrelated aspects 
of alienation that influence student adaptation. Political alienation results from the  
failure of authorities, teachers, administrative officials, and the system as a whole to 
meet the student’s needs. The politically alienated student feels that the authority struc-
ture of the university is not legitimate because it is unconcerned about students, because 
it does not involve them in its decision procedures, because it allows its priorities to 
be set by vested interests, and because it is incapable of solving the problems it faces.  
Anomie stems not from dissatisfaction with the formal authority system but from a lack of  
contact with the norms and values that determine and direct behavior of individuals in 
the university. These norms and values are communicated most directly through con-
tact with one’s peers. We have found, for example, that feelings of anomie among TECH  
students are strongly associated with lack of involvement in a personally important 
group of peers (Kolb et al., 1972). Anomie students feel lonely, isolated, and out of 
place at TECH. They have difficulty determining what is expected of them and what 
they believe.
Figures 7.9 and 7.10 show the anomie scores and political alienation scores respectively 
in the four departments for students whose learning styles are congruent and incongru-
ent with their discipline demands. The results are generally consistent with the predic-
tion that there would be higher anomie and political alienation among those students 
whose learning style is incongruent with their discipline norms. (None of the political-
alienation differences are significant statistically, however. Anomie significance levels for 
humanities and economics were p < .10 and p < .01, respectively.) One interesting fact 
in Figure 7.10 is the very high political alienation scores of all students in the humanities 
department. Humanities, in fact, scored highest on this variable of all the departments 
in the institute. This further develops the pattern of humanities as a deviant learning 
environment at TECH.
258 
Experiential Learning
Further insight into the effect of learning styles on social adaptation can be gained by 
examining student involvement with an important peer group (Figure 7.11). Students 
were asked to rate on a 1-to-5 scale (5 = very involved) how involved they were with 
their most important peer group. As has already been noted, previous research showed 
high involvement with peers to be associated with low anomie. As Figure 7.11 shows, 
in all four departments, students with learning styles matching departmental norms 
tended to be highly involved with their peers. This pattern was most pronounced in the 
humanities (p < .05) and economics (p < .01) departments. These results suggest that 
student peer groups may be an important vehicle for the communication of the learning-
style requirements of a department, although, as we already know from many studies of 
formal and informal organizations, peer-group norms may sometimes run counter to 
the formal organizational requirements. Some evidence for this special role of the peer

group can be seen in a comparison of the economics and humanities departments. In 
both these departments, students whose learning style fits with the discipline demands 
are very involved with their peers; and both groups of students score very low in anomie, 
as we would predict. Yet the convergent economics students score very low in political 
alienation, whereas the divergent humanities students feel extremely politically alienated 
from the university. Thus, in humanities, student peer-group solidarity among divergers 
is based on norms of alienation and rebellion from the university, and in economics, the 
convergent peer-group norms support the goals and procedures of the formal authori-
ties. This may in part account for the fact that the grades of the divergent humanities 
students are poor relative to those of other humanities students, while the grades of the 
convergent economics students are far better than those of other students in economics.

Figure 7.11  Students’ Involvement with an Important Peer Group as a Function of Match between 
Discipline Demands and Learning Style in Four Undergraduate Departments
The research above illustrates the usefulness of experiential learning theory for  
describing specialized developmental processes in undergraduate education by describing  
variations in the ways people learn, and corresponding variations in the learning 
demands of different academic disciplines. This study of TECH undergraduates shows 
that, at least in this one institution, the experiential learning theory typology is useful 
for describing the learning-demand characteristics of different academic departments 
and for predicting the direction of student career choices; and through examination 
261
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
of the matches and mismatches between student learning styles and departmental 
learning demands, the typology helps to explain variations in academic performance 
and adaptation to the university. These results suggest that the experiential learning 
model may well provide a useful framework for the design and management of learn-
ing experiences. As was already noted, the dominant trend in research on the “cli-
mate” of learning environments has been to focus on the effect on performance and 
adaptation of social-emotional variables such as motivation, attitudes, participation, 
liking for the teacher, and social isolation. Many of these variables have been shown 
to be important. However, the results of this study suggest that the climate of learning 
environments might as productively be examined in terms of its effect on the learn-
ing process itself and, in particular, on the learning styles of students. Rather than 
being a cause of successful academic performance, motivation to learn may well be a 
result of learning climates that match learning styles and thereby produce successful 
learning experiences. Similarly, the sources of student alienation may lie as much in 
failures to achieve the university’s central mission—learning—as they do in its social  
milieu.
Professional Education and Career Adaptation
Specialization through the process of accentuation is a major force in undergraduate uni-
versity education in general, but there is reason to suspect that this process is even more 
central to professional education. From a social control point of view, professions seem to 
have originally emerged in the areas of human activity—medicine, religion, law—where 
it is not feasible to judge performance on the basis of outcomes. Since one cannot judge 
a doctor on whether or not a specific patient dies or a lawyer on whether a specific case 
is won or lost, the emphasis in professions is on controlling the means of performance 
rather than the outcomes. One is therefore professionally competent if he or she performs 
the accepted professional activities or methods adequately, regardless of their results. As 
professions have expanded into other areas of human activity, this emphasis on means 
and methods has been retained. One result of this emphasis on means of performance is 
that schools of professional education have the primary responsibility for the develop-
ment and certification of professional competence. Although programs of peer review, 
periodic licensing, and continuing education are now appearing in some professions, 
for the most part the professional student on graduation is presumed competent for life. 
This responsibility causes professional schools to make every possible effort to incorpo-
rate the appropriate knowledge, skills, and attitudes deemed necessary for professional 
competence.
As a result, the process of socialization into a profession becomes an intense experi-
ence that instills not only knowledge and skills but also a fundamental reorientation of 
one’s identity. We refer to this orientation as a professional mentality. This mentality is

pervasive throughout all areas of the professional’s life; it includes standards and ethics, 
the appropriate ways to think and behave, the criteria by which one judges value, what is 
good or bad. Learning style is an important part of professional mentality. It represents 
the generic learning competencies that facilitate the acquisition of the specific perfor-
mance skills required for effectiveness in the core professional role. Through processes 
of selection and socialization, professional schools make every effort to ensure the proper 
professional mentality in their graduates. This education is a major social control on the 
quality of the professional service.
A problem arises, however, when we consider the nature of professional careers in a rap-
idly changing society. As Whitehead observed, “The fixed person for the fixed duties, who 
in older societies was such a godsend, in the future will be a public danger” (1926, p. 282).  
Few professionals remain for a lifetime in the core professional role for which they were 
trained. In engineering, for example, the typical career path requires a transition to 
management, a job role requiring a different portfolio of competencies and a different 
learning style from the convergent professional mentality so suited to engineering work. 
This lifelong career perspective poses a serious dilemma for professional education. 
Should it continue to emphasize intensive socialization in the specialized role require-
ments of the profession, or should some of this rigorous specialized training give way to 
the broader development of learning competencies required for lifelong learning? The 
choice for broader development may mean less specialized education at a time when the 
knowledge required for professional competence is increasing. The specialized choice 
may result in professional deformation—in the intensive overlearning of a specialized 
professional mentality that actively hinders adaptation to the changing requirements of 
one’s career.
The dilemma has been central to much of the self-examination, social criticism, and 
student/alumni evaluation of professional education. Schein, for example, has outlined 
eight problems of professional education, all of which are related to the dilemma of spe-
cialized vs. integrative education:
 
1. The professions are so specialized that they have become unresponsive to certain 
classes of social problems that require an interdisciplinary or interprofessional 
point of view—e.g., the urban problem.
 
2. Educational programs in professional schools, early career paths, and formal or 
informal licensing procedures have become so rigid and standardized that many 
young professionals cannot do the kind of work they wish to do.
 
3. The norms for entry into the professions have become so rigid that certain 
classes of applicants, such as older people, women, and career switchers, are in 
effect discriminated against.
263
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
 
4. The norms of the professions and the growing base of basic and applied knowl-
edge have become so convergent in most professions that it is difficult for inno-
vations to occur in any but the highly specialized content areas at the frontiers of 
the profession.
 
5. Professionals have become unresponsive to the needs of many classes of ultimate 
clients or users of the services, working instead for the organization that employs 
them.
 
6. Professional education is almost totally geared to producing autonomous spe-
cialists and provides neither training nor experience in how to work as a mem-
ber of a team, how to collaborate with clients in identifying needs and possible 
solutions, and how to collaborate with other professionals on complex projects.
 
7. Professional education provides no training for those graduates who wish to 
work as members of and become managers of intra- or interprofessional project 
teams working on complex social problems.
 
8. Professional education generally underutilizes the applied behavioral sciences, 
especially in helping professionals to increase their self-insight, their ability to 
diagnose and manage client relationships and complex social problems, their 
ability to sort out the ethical and value issues inherent in their professional role, 
and their ability to continue to learn throughout their careers. [Schein, 1972, 
p. 59]
A Comparative Study of Professional  
Education in Social Work and Engineering
To explore this dilemma and its attendant problems, we examined the effect of profes-
sional education on career adaptation by surveying the alumni of two professional edu-
cation programs from a single university.3 The alumni from the university’s social-work 
and engineering schools in the graduating classes of 1975, 1970, 1965, 1960, and 1955 
were studied by means of questionnaires, tests, and interviews (see Kolb and Wolfe et al., 
1981, for detailed methodologies). The professions of social work and engineering were 
chosen for study because they typify the social and science-based professions respectively.  
Thus, we could examine specialized education in two different professions with different 
knowledge structures and learning styles—the contextualist/accommodative orientation 
3.  The research reported in this section is part of a larger research program on professional education 
and career development (see Kolb and Wolfe et al., 1981). The data reported here were analyzed in col-
laboration with Ronald Sims.

in social work and the formist/convergent orientation in engineering—and examine the 
consequences of this education on later career development.
The science-based professions, and especially engineering, require a highly developed 
capacity for working with abstract conceptualizations in the utilization of advanced 
technology for solving real-world problems. The work itself results not so much in fur-
ther conceptualization (the province of the basic sciences) but rather in action taken to 
solve practical problems and to develop and construct physical structures, products, and 
technical processes. Thus, a well-developed competence in active experimentation is 
equally essential for effective work in the science-based professions. The adaptive com-
petencies—symbolic complexity and behavioral complexity—combine to make up the 
convergent style that is the forte of the professional engineer.
Career advancement for engineers often involves a promotion to managerial positions 
that generally require a substantially different mix of competencies. Much less of these 
managers’ time is devoted to the direct application of scientific knowledge. Although 
there is a continuing concern for action, the focus is much more on the concrete reali-
ties of managing people, planning for various contingencies, setting priorities, and 
handling administrative tasks. The emergent need, in this transition to management, is 
for increased competence in handling the complexities and vagaries of concrete experi-
ence. The convergent modality must give way to an accommodative style of adaptation, 
based on competencies in affective complexity (concrete experience) coupled with 
behavioral complexity (active experimentation). Evidence for this transition in engi-
neering careers is seen in the current job roles of engineering alumni in our study. Of 
new engineers three years on the job (the 1975 alumni), only 31 percent are managers. 
This percentage rises steadily over time to the 1955 alumni group, where 76 percent 
are managers.
Professional work in human-services fields (such as social work) is predicated on highly 
developed accommodation skills. The emphasis is on dealing with the social and emo-
tional complexities of people in need. The helping process calls for heightened sensitivity 
to the concrete realities of the human condition, matched with active problem solving. 
These generic competencies are required for the effective delivery of services to the dis-
advantaged, the troubled, and the needy.
Career advancement for human-service professionals may also involve taking on mana-
gerial responsibilities, but in this case, a change in basic adaptive style may or may not 
be required. Although a newly appointed director of a social agency generally has many 
new things to learn, his or her accommodative style is generally appropriate for most of 
the developmental agenda in this transition. Nonetheless, for many who are promoted 
from direct-service delivery to administrative or policy-formation assignments, some 
increase in abstract analytic competencies is called for. One must back away from some 
of the concrete details of casework with individuals in order to gain a larger perspective. 
265
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
The basic accommodator style begins to require a backup of converger skills or perhaps 
even assimilator (social-planning) skills. The study of social-work alumni shows a less 
clear picture of career transition in that field. The percentage of managers in all five 
alumni groups ranges from 43 to 63 percent, with no clear transitional pattern. These 
data, along with observations of individual career histories, suggest that careers in social 
work are primarily of a dual-track nature. People enter the profession with an orienta-
tion to management or direct service and tend to stay in that job role more than is the 
case in engineering.
Thus, engineering and social work seem to have very different career paths. In engineer-
ing, there is a definite general progression from direct engineering work to manage-
rial positions over the cohort years, whereas social work appears to have two tracks, 
administrative and direct service, which begin in graduate school and continue equally 
in early and late career with less distinct progression from one role to the next. Since 
professional education must prepare people not only for early career demands but also 
for the often quite different demands of later career responsibilities, the different struc-
ture of career paths in these two fields offers contrasts of great interest for the study of  
career adaptation.
Professional Mentality and Professional Deformation
When we examine the Learning Style Inventory scores of social-work and engineering 
alumni (Figure 7.12), we see that the difference between the two professions in adaptive 
orientation is dramatically illustrated, particularly in their emphasis on abstractedness 
(knowing via comprehension) versus concreteness (knowing via apprehension). Engi-
neering alumni fall mostly in the convergent learning style (41 percent); social-work 
alumni fall in the divergent (34 percent) and accommodative (29 percent) quadrants. 
The science-based profession of engineering and the social profession of social work are 
thus markedly different in the way they acquire and use knowledge, at least as measured 
by the learning styles of alumni educated in these two professions.
 Equally relevant to our consideration of specialized professional education and its effect 
on career adaptation is the degree of variation in learning style among social workers 
and engineers within their professional specialties. In engineering, we were surprised to 
find a great deal of homogeneity in learning style. There was significantly less variance 
in LSI scores than in social work. More important, there were no significant differences 
among alumni cohort years (note that the averages for the five cohort years are all tightly 
grouped about the engineering mean in Figure 7.12) or among the three major job roles 
currently held by engineering alumni—manager, technical manager, and “bench” engi-
neer. Insofar as learning style is a part of the professional mentality of engineering, we 
see here a very consistent professional mentality that varies little even in the face of age, 
years of work experience, and different job demands. The social-work professionals

show much greater variation in learning style. There is wide (although not statistically 
significant) variation among cohort-year averages, and the two major job roles in social 
work, administration and direct client service, are significantly differentiated on the 
active-reflective dimension of the LSI (p < .02), as one might predict from an analysis 
of demands of these jobs. Administrative job holders are primarily accommodative in 
their approach to learning, whereas direct-service personnel emphasize the divergent 
learning style.

Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
Taken together, the results above portray engineering as a field with a highly paradig-
matic, coherent professional mentality shaped by the selection and socialization forces 
of accentuation. A paradigm refers to the body of theory about cause and effect that is 
subscribed to by all members of the field (Kuhn, 1962). This paradigm serves two impor-
tant organizing functions: It provides a consistent account of most of the phenomena of 
interest in a particular area, and it defines those problems that require further research. 
From these data we would also infer that the social-work profession is a less established 
and paradigmatic profession than engineering. Schein (1972) identified three trends of 
maturing professions: (1) They become more convergent in their knowledge base and 
standards of practice; (2) they become more highly differentiated and specialized; and (3) 
they become more bureaucratized and rigid with respect to the career alternatives they 
allow. On all three criteria, the social professions, including social work, are less mature 
and paradigmatic than are the science-based professions.
Adaptive Competence and Career Adaptation
Given these differences in the maturity and paradigmatic nature of social work and engi-
neering, we would expect different problems of career adaptation in the two fields. To 
the extent that the specialized professional mentality inculcated in the student becomes 
a central part of his or her identity, that student may become inflexible and intolerant 
toward styles that conflict with that mentality. This rigidity may actively inhibit one’s abil-
ity to adapt to changing career demands. This problem would seem to be most serious 
for the established paradigmatic professions that have clearly identified “ways of doing 
things” and the most intensive selection/socialization processes. Less paradigmatic pro-
fessions would appear to allow for greater flexibility and variability in their graduates, 
but in many cases this advantage may be offset by the lack of powerful models, tools, and 
technologies for achieving the core mission of the professions.
One way to assess career adaptation is to measure how well the competencies of the 
individual professional meet the demands of his or her current job. On the alumni 
questionnaire, respondents were asked to describe the demands of their current job 
and their corresponding level of ability to meet these job demands. The technique used 
was an earlier version of the competency circle described in Chapter 4 (pp. 131–134 
and Figure 4.10). Although, as was indicated earlier, these self-ratings of job demand 
and personal competence would obviously be enhanced by objective independent 
assessments, the responses of social work and engineering professionals nonethe-
less reveal interesting patterns of career adaptation. To begin with, differences in job 
demands were analyzed. The different job roles making up careers in engineering and 
social work require different portfolios of performance competencies. Engineering 
jobs require predominately convergent competencies associated with the symbolic and 
268 
Experiential Learning
behavioral learning competencies. Managerial jobs in engineering require more affec-
tive and behavioral competencies. Direct-service social work requires highly developed 
affective competencies, and administrative jobs emphasize behavioral competencies 
more strongly.
To test this hypothesis, one-way analyses of variances were done between the job demands 
of the different job roles in social work and engineering, and the mean scores were plot-
ted on the competency-circle graphs (Figures 7.13 and 7.14). Figure 7.13 shows great 
differences in the different job roles comprising engineering careers. Using a Scheffe 
procedure at .05 level, the significant subsets between job roles are circled. As can be seen 
in Figure 7.13, professional engineers in the job roles of engineer, technical manager, 
and manager do perceive their jobs as having different demands in the competencies 
of dealing with people, being personally involved, and being sensitive to people’s feel-
ings, seeking and exploiting opportunities, making decisions, and setting goals, design-
ing experiments, testing theories, and gathering information. Generally, managerial 
jobs require greater affective and behavioral competencies, and direct engineering work 
requires greater symbolic and perceptual competencies.
For social workers, the analysis of variance procedures showed significant differences 
between job roles on making decisions, seeking and exploiting opportunities, analyzing 
quantitative data, sensitivity to people’s feelings, and testing theories and ideas (Figure 
7.14). Direct-service social workers and administrators perceive their jobs as having dif-
ferent job demands. Direct-service professionals see their jobs as more demanding affec-
tively than do administrators. Administrators perceive their jobs as more demanding 
behaviorally—for instance, seeking and exploiting opportunities, committing themselves 
to objectives, and making decisions.
By comparing alumni’s self-ratings of their work abilities with their descriptions of the 
demands of their current jobs, it is possible to determine the percentage of alumni in dif-
ferent job roles who see themselves as being underqualified in each of the four clusters 
of performance competencies. These data are shown in Table 7.1.
The data for engineers suggest problems in career adaptation. One-third or more of the 
technical managers and managers in the engineering alumni sample report that they are 
underqualified in affective and behavioral competencies. These percentages are greater than 
the corresponding percentages of bench engineers who are underqualified in affective and 
behavioral competencies, suggesting that the larger number of underqualified managers 
in these areas results from a failure to learn how to respond to the increased affective and 
behavioral demands characteristic of managerial jobs (Figure 7.13). The fact that the num-
ber of affectively and behaviorally underqualified managers is greater than symbolically 
and perceptually underqualified managers suggests that professional education more ade-
quately prepares professionals in symbolic and perceptual competencies than in affective 
and behavioral competencies (see the following section on learning at school and at work).

Table 7.1  Percentage of Those in Different Job Roles Whose Work Abilities Do Not Meet Job 
Demands
In social work, 44 percent of the administrators report that they are underqualified in 
the behavioral competencies. The increase in the number of behaviorally underquali-
fied administrators over behaviorally underqualified direct-service workers would seem 
to result from a failure to learn how to respond to the increased behavioral demands 
of administrative jobs (see Table 7.1). However, a large percentage of administrators 
see themselves as underqualified in the other three areas of competence, as well as in 
the behavioral area that appears to be neglected in professional social-work education 
(Figure 7.16). This suggests that failures of career adaptation in social work are as much 
a result of a generalized lack of competencies to deal with the professional tasks in the 
administrative role that are often nearly impossible, as they are a result of professional 
deformation.
Thus we see differences in how professionals in social work and engineering adapt to the 
changing demands of their careers. The job roles in engineering and social work require 
quite different portfolios of performance competencies. Engineering jobs require strong 
capabilities in symbolic and perceptual areas; direct-service social work emphasizes affec-
tive and perceptual competencies. Administrative and managerial jobs across the two pro-
fessions are very similar, requiring highly developed affective and behavioral competencies.
Both professions seem to have problems of career adaptation, although for different 
reasons. In social work, it appears that many incumbents of jobs at all levels feel some-
what overwhelmed by the requirements of their jobs. The challenge for professional 
education would seem to lie in the development of more powerful “social technologies” 
and educational methods for responding to our country’s increasing social problems in 
a time of scarce resources.
The problem in engineering may more properly be considered one of professional 
deformation. The scientific technologies of the various engineering fields with their

attendant scientific problem-solving mentality have proven their potency repeatedly. Career 
adaptation problems in engineering stem more from overspecialization in these learning 
competencies, often to the point where professionals in the field have difficulty performing 
in managerial job roles that require greater affective and behavioral competence.
Learning in School and at Work
The specialized development that characterizes most higher educational experiences 
usually carries forward into one’s early career. First jobs often are continuing appren-
ticeships for the refinement of the specialized skills and knowledge acquired in pre-
paratory education. The acquisition of the knowledge, skills, and values that began in 
school is carried forward in the workplace, as successful performance in a specialized 
area of expertise is rewarded by the assignment of increasingly complex challenges in 
that area. Yet, as has been noted, there is a transition point in most career paths where 
the demands of job roles change, requiring an increasingly integrative perspective on 
learning. A study of the accounting and marketing professions conducted by Clarke et 
al. (1977) illustrated this change in learning style in the later stages of one’s career. Their 
study compared cross-sectional samples of accounting and marketing students and pro-
fessionals in school and at lower-, middle-, and senior-level career stages. The learning 
styles of marketing and accounting MBA students were similar, being fairly balanced 
on the four learning modes.
Lower-level accountants had convergent learning styles, and this convergent emphasis 
was even more pronounced in middle-level accountants, reflecting a highly technical 
emphasis in the early and middle stages of accounting careers. The senior-level accoun-
tants, however, were accommodative in their learning style, reflecting a greater concern 
with client relations and administration than with technical functions. Marketing profes-
sionals at the lower level also were convergent in learning style but became highly con-
crete at middle-level responsibilities, reflecting a shift from technical to creative concerns. 
The senior marketing personnel had accommodative learning styles similar to those of 
senior accountants, probably reflecting the same client and management concerns.
There is a similar transition in the learning orientations of engineers and social work-
ers over the course of their careers. In a selected interview study of the engineering and 
social-work alumni, Gypen found that:
As engineers move up from the bench to the management positions, they comple-
ment their initial strengths in abstract conceptualization and active experimenta-
tion with the previously non-dominant orientations of concrete experience and 
reflective observation. As social workers move from direct service into adminis-
trative positions, they move in the opposite direction of the engineers. [Gypen, 
1980, p. ii]
273
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
Furthermore, Gypen found that these changes in learning style were directly related to 
the changing demands of one’s current job.
These results give a somewhat more optimistic picture of professional career adaptation 
than the just-reported data showing that large numbers of professionals describe them-
selves as underqualified for their current job demands (see Table 7.1). From this perspec-
tive, the developmental “glass” appears half full rather than half empty. Some change in 
the direction of career adaptation does occur after professional education, most likely 
through learning on the job.
To explore how the social-work and engineering alumni developed their current port-
folios of competencies, the alumni questionnaires asked respondents to rate how much 
their professional education had contributed to the development of each of the perfor-
mance competencies described in the last section and how much their work experience 
had contributed to the development of these competencies. Their responses are plotted 
on the competency circle for engineering alumni in Figure 7.15. The dark shaded area 
represents contributions of professional education to competencies, and the lined area 
shows contributions of work experience to the development of competence. The dark 
line shows the average current job demand for each competence. The figure shows dra-
matic differences in the competencies acquired in education and work. Engineering 
education seems to prepare or, in several cases, overprepare people for the demands 
of their jobs in symbolic and perceptual competencies but makes little contribution to 
the development of affective and behavioral competencies. These seem to be acquired 
primarily in the work setting.
Figure 7.16 shows the same analysis for social-work alumni. Here, the shaded area repre-
senting the contribution of social-work professional education is larger than in engineer-
ing, but it is still biased toward the development of perceptual and symbolic skills. Work 
experience contributes more to the development of affective and particularly behavioral 
skills, as in the engineering figure.
Surprisingly, these patterns were not significantly different for different alumni years; 
alumni only three years out of school (the class of 1975) showed the same pattern as 
alumni 23 years out (the class of 1955). Engineering alumni in all cohort groups reported 
that their professional education emphasized the development of symbolic and percep-
tual skills while neglecting affective and behavioral skills. Social-work alumni in all 
cohort groups felt that their professional education had developed required competen-
cies in the affective, perceptual, and symbolic areas but had neglected the development 
of behavioral competencies. Both social-work and engineering alumni consistently 
felt that they had made up for these deficits as well as supplemented their strengths 
through experiential learning on the job. In another study, Sims (1981) found that this 
on-the-job learning is facilitated in those organizations with a strong growth climate 
characterized by good supervision, advancement potential and autonomy, and a chance

to grow and develop, and is inhibited in organizations whose climate is not supportive 
of learning and development. These results showing the critical role of organization 
climate have been independently replicated by Margulies and Raia (1967). Lifelong 
learning is not automatic but must be nurtured in a supportive learning environment, 
both in school and at work.
Managing the Learning Process
To conduct the educational process in universities in a manner that attends to the indi-
vidual learning styles of students and fosters student development requires identification 
and management of those aspects of the educational system that influence the learn-
ing process. Such a management system must be soundly built on a valid model of the 
learning process. There has been a great burgeoning of educational techniques designed 
to assist the learning process in recent years: computer-aided instruction; experienced-
based learning materials in math, science, and psychology; programmed instruction; 
games; multimedia curricula; open classrooms; and so on. Although these techniques 
tend to be highly sophisticated and creative applications of their own particular fields of 
expertise, be it computer science, psychology, or architecture, they are much less sophis-
ticated about how they enhance human learning. The weakness of nearly all these tech-
niques is the failure to recognize and explicitly provide for the differences in learning 
styles that are characteristic of both individuals and subject matters. Even though many 
of these educational innovations have been developed in the name of individualized 
education and self-directed learning, there has been little attempt to specify along which 
dimensions individualization is to take place. For example, although computer-aided 
instruction and programmed learning provide alternative learning routes or branches 
for the individual learner, these branches tend to be based primarily on various elabora-
tions of the subject matter being taught (for example; a wrong answer puts the learner 
on a branch giving him more information about the question). Little has been done to 
provide the individual learner with branches that provide alternative learning methods 
(such as pictoral versus symbolic presentation) based on the person’s learning style. In 
addition, there has been little research to assess how the effectiveness of various teaching 
methods is contingent on either individual learning styles or the type of subject matter 
being taught. (Two significant exceptions in the case of learning styles are the works of 
David Hunt, 1974; and Liam Hudson, 1966.)
Learning Environments
Experiential learning theory provides one such system for managing the learning process 
in Fry’s (1978) concept of the learning environment. Any educational program, course 
design, or classroom session can be viewed as having degrees of orientation toward each 
of the four learning modes in the experiential learning model, labeled as affective, per-
277
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
ceptual, symbolic, and behavioral, to connote the overall climate they create and the 
particular learning skill or mode they require (Kolb and Fry, 1975). Thus an affective 
environment emphasizes the experiencing of concrete events; a symbolic environment 
emphasizes abstract conceptualization; a perceptual environment stresses observation 
and appreciation; a behavioral environment stresses action taking in situations with real 
consequences. Any particular learning experience can have some or all of these orienta-
tions, to differing degrees, at the same time. A typical lecture obviously has perceptual 
and symbolic orientations, because it requires students to listen to and interpret the pre-
sentation (reflective observation skills) and to reason and induce conceptual relationships 
from what they hear (abstract conceptualization skills). But there may be an affective 
orientation as well. Some students may be experiencing the teacher doing the lecturing 
as a role model. Or if we direct questions or pose dilemmas to the class, we increase the 
behavioral orientation by urging students to take action by speaking up and testing their 
ideas out in public.
Fry has found that each type of environmental orientation can be measured by observing 
the following variables in the context of a course: the purpose of the major activities, the 
primary source or use of information, the rules guiding learner behavior, the teacher’s 
role, and the provision for feedback. These are useful cues, because to a great extent they 
are controlled by the instructor, faculty, or administration, independently of the learner. 
Most decisions affecting these aspects of learning environments are made before learner-
classroom interactions take place. Using these variables, the following pictures of differ-
ent types of environments result.
Affectively complex learning environments are ones in which the emphasis is on expe-
riencing what it is actually like to be a professional in the field under study. Learners 
are engaged in activities that simulate or mirror what they would do as graduates, or 
they are encouraged to reflect upon an experience to generate these insights and feel-
ings about themselves. The information discussed and generated is more often cur-
rent/immediate. It often comes from expressions of feelings, values, and opinions by 
the learner in discussions with peers or the teacher. Such expressions of feelings are 
encouraged and seen as productive inputs to the learning process. The learner’s activi-
ties often vary from any prior schedule as a result of the learner’s needs. The teacher 
serves as a role model for the field or profession, relating to learners on a personal 
basis and more often as a colleague than an authority. Feedback is personalized with 
regard to each individual’s needs and goals, as opposed to comparative. It can come 
from both peers and the teacher. There is accepted discussion and critique of how the 
course is proceeding, and thus, specific events within a single class session are often 
more emergent than prescribed.
Perceptually complex learning environments are ones in which the primary goal is to 
understand something: to be able to identify relationships between concepts, to be able 
to define problems for investigation, to be able to collect relevant information, to be 
278 
Experiential Learning
able to research a question, and the like. To do this, learners are encouraged to view 
the topic or subject matter from different perspectives (their own experience, expert 
opinion, literature) and in different ways (listen, observe, write, discuss, act out, think, 
smell). If a task is being done or a problem is being solved, the emphasis is more on how 
it gets done, the process, than on the solution. Success or performance is not measured 
against rigid criteria. Learners are instead left to conclude, answer, and define criteria 
of success for themselves. Individual differences in this process are allowed and used 
as a basis for further understanding. Learners are thus free to explore others’ ideas, 
opinions, and reactions in order to determine their own perspective. In this process, 
the teacher serves as a “mirror” or “process facilitator.” He or she is nonevaluative, 
answers questions with questions, suggests instead of critiquing, and relates current 
issues to larger ones. The teacher creates a reward system that emphasizes methodol-
ogy of inquiry versus getting a particular answer. In class sessions, there is planned 
time spent on looking back at previous steps, events, or decisions in order to guide the 
learner in future activities.
Symbolically complex learning environments are ones in which the learner is involved in 
trying to solve a problem for which there is usually a right answer or a best solution. The 
source of information, topic, or problem being dealt with is abstract, in that it is removed 
from the present and presented via reading, data, pictures, lecture inputs, and so on. In 
handling such information, the learner is both guided and constrained by externally 
imposed rules of inference, such as symbols, computer technology, jargon, theorems, 
graphical keys, or protocols. There is often a demand on the learner to recall these rules, 
concepts, or relationships via memory. The teacher is the accepted representative of the 
body of knowledge—judging and evaluating learner output, interpreting information 
that cannot be dealt with by the rules of inference, and enforcing methodology and the 
scientific rigor of the field of study. The teacher is also a timekeeper, taskmaster, and 
enforcer of schedules of events in order that the learner can become immersed in the 
analytical exercise necessary to reach a solution and not worry about having to set goals 
and manage his or her own time. Success is measured against the right or best solution, 
expert opinion, or otherwise rigid criteria imposed by the teacher or accepted in the 
field of study. Decisions concerning flow and nature of activities in the class session are 
essentially made by the teacher and mostly prior to the course.
Behaviorally complex learning environments are those in which the emphasis is upon 
actively applying knowledge or skills to a practical problem. The problem need not have 
a right or best answer, but it does have to be something the learner can relate to, value, 
and feel some intrinsic satisfaction from having solved. This would normally be a “real-
life” problem, case, or simulation that the learner could expect to face as a professional. 
In the attack on the problem, the focus is on doing. Completing the task is essential. 
Although there may be an externally imposed deadline or periodic checkpoints for which 
reports or other information are required, most of the learner’s time is his to manage. 
279
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
He is thus concerned with what effect his present behavior will have vis-à-vis the overall 
task to be done. The next activity he engages in will not occur independent of the one 
he is presently in. In this way, the learner is always left to make decisions/choices about 
what to do next or how to proceed. The teacher can be available as a coach or advisor, but 
primarily in the learner’s request or initiative. Success is measured against criteria associ-
ated with the task: how well something worked, feasibility, sellability, client acceptance, 
cost, testing results, aesthetic quality, and so on.
Learning environments vary in the degrees to which they are oriented to any of the four 
pure types described above. In a study of a landscape-architecture department (Fry, 
1978), ten courses were measured to determine the degree of environmental complexity 
or the tendency of a course to be oriented in one or more ways. The results indicated 
that all the courses had degrees of orientation in each area and that it was even possible 
for a given course to be very affectively and symbolically oriented at the same time. Con-
sistent patterns of environmental orientation showed up in the following combinations: 
perceptual and symbolic—an “investigative” or “inquiry” climate with the emphasis 
on inductive theory building and on understanding why things happen (this was most 
characteristic of lecture and seminar course sessions in this setting); symbolic and behav-
ioral—a “mastery” climate where emphasis was on mastering techniques by practice in 
problem solving (this was most characteristic of laboratory and recitation sections of 
courses in this study); behavioral and affective—a “simulative” climate where situations 
were created to put the learner in the role expected of a graduate in a work setting (this 
was most characteristic of courses requiring field experience, site visits, and interaction 
with others outside the classroom in this setting).
Learner-Environment Interactions
When experiential learning theory is used to view the learner and instructional envi-
ronment in the terms discussed above, useful relationships begin to emerge concerning 
the design of learning situations. Studies of the preferences of MBA students and gradu-
ate students in architecture (Fry, 1978; Kolb, 1976) suggest that what we considered to 
be characteristics of affective, perceptual, symbolic, and behavioral orientations in the 
environment do relate to and require learner skills in concrete experience, reflective 
observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation, respectively (see 
Table 7.2).
The students who scored high in concrete experience as a preferred learning mode indi-
cated that their ability to learn was enhanced by affectively related factors such as per-
sonalized feedback, sharing feelings, teachers behaving as friendly helpers, activities 
oriented toward applying skills to real-life problems, peer feedback, and the need to be 
self-directed and autonomous. An environmental factor that hindered their learning 
ability was theoretical reading assignments.

Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
The learners scoring highest in reflective observation reported perceptually related envi-
ronmental factors as being helpful. These included teachers providing expert interpreta-
tions and guiding or limiting discussions, output being judged by external criteria of field 
or discipline, and lecturing. Reflective learners are not helped by task-oriented situations 
where information generation was focused on getting some job done.
The learners scoring highest in abstract conceptualization cited symbolically related 
factors such as case studies, thinking alone, and theory readings as contributing to their 
ability to learn. They also felt that several elements of affectively and behaviorally ori-
ented environments hindered their ability to learn. These included group exercises and 
simulations, the need to be self-directed or autonomous, personalized feedback, teachers 
being models of the profession, sharing personal feelings about subject matter, dealing 
with “here-and-now” information, and activities oriented toward experiencing being a 
professional in the field.
Finally, the learners with the strongest active-experimentation tendencies identified 
several factors as helpful that one would associate with a behaviorally oriented learning 
environment. These included small-group discussions, projects, peer feedback, home-
work problems, the teacher behaving as a model of the profession, being left to judge 
one’s work by oneself, and activities designed to apply skills to practical problems. Things 
these students reported as hindrances to their ability to learn included lectures, teachers 
serving as taskmasters, and having their work evaluated as simply right or wrong.
People enter learning situations with an already-developed learning style. Associated 
with this learning style will be some more or less explicit theory about how people learn, 
or more specifically, about how they themselves learn best. Learning environments that 
operate according to a learning theory that is dissimilar to a person’s preferred style of 
learning are likely to be rejected or resisted by that person. Many students, for example, 
resist required courses designed to broaden their interests. One way to deal with this 
problem is for teacher and student to share explicitly their respective theories of learn-
ing. From this discussion, the student can gain an insight into why the subject matter 
is taught as it is and what adjustments he need make in his approach to learning this 
subject. The discussion can help the teacher to identify the variety of learning styles pre-
sented in the class and to modify his/her approach to accommodate these differences. 
A third benefit from explicit discussion of the learning process as it applies to the spe-
cific subject matter at hand is that both teacher and students are stimulated to examine 
and refine their learning theories. Learning becomes a skill that can be improved and 
coached. Perhaps the most important implication of the interaction between learning 
styles and learning environments is that empathy and communication are central to the 
teaching process. To educate means literally “to draw out.” This requires an ability on 
the part of the teacher to make contact with the students’ inner resources, attitudes, and 
ideas and through dialogue to develop and refine their knowledge and skills.
282 
Experiential Learning
A second practical concern that emerges from our research on learner-environment 
transactions is the need to individualize instruction. Most traditional classroom teach-
ing methods are too homogeneous as learning environments, appealing to only a 
single learning style while handicapping those who would prefer to learn another way. 
Approaches that individualize the learning process to meet the student’s goals, learn-
ing style, pace, and life situation will pay off handsomely in increased learning. One 
key to this individualization is a shift in the teacher role from dispenser of information 
to coach or manager of the learning process. The widespread use of e-learning innova-
tions is facilitating this role transition by providing alternative modes for delivery of 
content.
Specialized vs. Integrative Developmental Goals
Matching student learning styles with corresponding learning environments seems an 
easy and practical way to improve the learning process. But does this mean we should 
alter our course designs to accommodate the type of learner that comes into them, and/
or require specialized learning skills that typify the inquiry norms of a given profession 
or field of study?
To answer this question, it is necessary to consider the goals of the educational program. 
In curriculum design, three classes of learning objectives must be considered: content 
objectives, learning-style objectives, and growth and creativity objectives. Very often in 
the design of curricula, it is only the content objectives that are explicitly considered: 
What material should be covered? What concepts should be introduced? What facts does 
the student need to know? Yet in most academic disciplines, there are also important 
norms about learning style. Students are expected to adopt certain perspectives on their 
work. They must learn to think like a mathematician or feel like a poet or make decisions 
like an executive. Thus, the learning style that is felt to be appropriate for a given area of 
study must also be considered when educational objectives are set.
To complicate matters further, the third class of objectives must be considered, objec-
tives for growth and creativity. In addition to specialized developmental training, 
teachers often have objectives concerning the growth and creativity of their students. 
In making students more “well-rounded,” the aim is to develop the weaknesses in 
the students’ learning style to stimulate growth in their ability to learn from a variety 
of learning perspectives. Here, the goal is something more than making students’ 
learning styles adaptive for their particular career entry job. The aim is to make the 
student self-renewing and self-directed; to focus on integrative development where 
the person is highly developed in each of the four learning modes: active, reflective, 
abstract, and concrete. Here, the student is taught to experience the tension and 
conflict among these orientations, for it is from the resolution of these tensions that 
creativity springs.
283
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
The dilemma in making choices among these three levels of objectives is illustrated 
by Plovnick’s study, cited earlier, which concluded that the major emphasis in physics 
education was on convergent learning, and that physics students who had convergent 
learning styles were more content with their majors than students whose learning styles 
did not match the inquiry norms of physics. The dilemma for the physics department is 
this. To contribute in physics today, one must know many facts, so content learning is 
important and takes time, time that might be spent developing the convergent skills of 
divergers. So isn’t it simpler to select (implicitly or explicitly) people who already possess 
these convergent experimental and theoretical skills? Perhaps, but in the process, what 
is lost is the creative tension between convergence and divergence. The result of this 
process may be a program that produces fine technicians but few innovators. Kuhn put 
the issue this way: “Because the old must be revalued and reordered when assimilating 
the new, discovery and invention in the sciences are usually intrinsically revolutionary. 
Therefore they do demand just that flexibility and open-mindedness that characterize 
and indeed define the divergent” (1962, p. 112). It just may be that one of the reasons that 
creative contributions in the sciences are made primarily by younger persons (Lehman, 
1953) is that the learning styles of older adults have been shaped by their professional 
training and experience, so that they adapt well to the inquiry norms of their profession 
but the creative tension is lost.
Implications for Higher Education
As we have seen, higher education today encourages early specialization, which neces-
sarily accentuates particular interests and skills. Should we continue to follow the trend 
toward increasingly specialized education, or should we be creating new educational 
programs that reassert the integrative emphasis lost in the demise of classical edu-
cation? Recently, Derek Bok’s President’s Report for Harvard University (Bok, 1978) 
outlined a revised undergraduate curriculum plan—a plan that some have character-
ized as a return to classical education, with its compulsory core courses in science 
and mathematics, literature and the arts, history, philosophy and social analysis, and 
foreign cultures. The pendulum swing toward specialization that Charles Eliot began 
in 1869 with the modest introduction of electives and the concept of a major may have 
reached its peak in the late 1960s in the course proliferation that came with students’ 
demands for relevance and participation in the educational decisions that affected their 
lives. The “back-to-basic-skills” climate that seemed to permeate American education 
at all levels in the 1970s may signal, among other things, the reassertion of an integra-
tive emphasis in the educational process.
There is little question that integrative development is important for both personal ful-
fillment and cultural development. It appears essential for growth and mastery of the 
period of adult development that Erikson has called the crisis of generativity versus 
284 
Experiential Learning
stagnation. The educational issue is how and when to intervene in a way that facilitates 
this development. The “hows” are not easy. Bok compared the introduction of the new 
core curriculum to “reorganizing a graveyard.” Specialization in the university is greatly 
reinforced by faculty reward systems, selection and evaluation criteria, and disciplinary 
values. The result of these organizational processes is brought into sharp focus when 
we examine the difficulties and obstacles that attend the establishment of truly inter-
disciplinary programs of research or teaching, or the struggles for survival and viability 
that face “deviant” disciplines in an institution where attention, resources, and prestige 
are focused on the dominant academic culture. Even at a scientific institute like TECH, 
where the humanities are firmly established with a distinguished faculty, we see intense 
student alienation, departmental evaluation standards that appear more attuned to the 
inquiry norms of engineering than to the humanities, and a subtle but powerful impe-
rialism of the dominant scientific culture on research and teaching activities. However 
useful scientific analyses of the humanities (for example, computer models of Greek 
myths) may be in their own right, one must ask how well such activities serve to broaden 
the worldview of the science or engineering specialist.
In the words of Robert Hutchins:
The reverence that natural science has inspired is in large part responsible for 
the steady narrowing of education that the progress of specialization has caused 
during the last thirty years. The progress of specialization has meant that the 
world and ourselves have been progressively taken apart, and at no point have 
they been put together again. As the progress of the scientific method has dis-
credited the methods of history, philosophy, and art, so the specialism essential 
to science has discredited a generalized approach to history, philosophy, art and 
all other subjects, including science itself. This means that comprehension has 
been discredited, for it cannot be attained by splitting the world into smaller and 
smaller bits. [Hutchins, 1953, p. 25]
The Institutional Context and Integrative Development
So far, this discussion has focused primarily on the course-level units of learning environ-
ments. It is more difficult to conceptualize the effect of the larger institutional context on 
student learning, although the effect is considerable. Included here is the organization 
and management of departments, including such things as student and faculty interac-
tion patterns, emphasis on research, teaching or practical application, the structure and 
number of required courses, emphasis on grades, and so on. Beyond departments, one 
must consider the university structure, its mission and philosophy of education, the 
alternative learning environments available, the selection/evaluation criteria for faculty 
and students, social networks outside of classes, campus atmosphere, and the like. Some 
evidence suggests that these large-system phenomena may be particularly connected with 
285
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
the affective and behavioral orientations. For example, faculty members in engineering 
have suggested to us that concrete experience and active experimentation skills in their 
students may be developed not as part of their formal curriculum of courses but rather in 
social groupings in fraternities, one-on-one relationships with faculty mentors, summer 
work experiences, and other extracurricular campus activities.
Liam Hudson has examined the effect of relationship between departments and larger 
organizational processes on the educational process:
At the pragmatic level, for instance, one makes no sense of a certain course in 
the behavioral sciences, until one sees it as a compromise reached between a 
number of university departments, each of which has a legitimate interest in 
its content. The curriculum, simply, is a by-product of a process that is starkly 
political. And at the conceptual level we find ourselves continually confronting 
mysterious notions, like that of a “discipline.” To begin to grasp what happens 
inside universities, we find ourselves compelled to grapple with the boundary 
rules which surround bodies of knowledge like history, medicine, chemistry or 
psychology, and to make interpretative sense of their function. We need, too, to 
come to terms with what one might describe as the politics of knowledge—that 
territory in which such disciplines take shape, in which schools of thought do 
battle with one another, and in which certain views of mankind are rendered 
legitimate, while others are cast beyond the pale. [Hudson, 1976, p. 219]
Thus, it would seem that a central function for the larger university organization is to pro-
vide the integrative structures and programs that counterbalance the tendencies toward 
specialization in student development and academic research. Continuous lifelong learn-
ing requires learning how to learn, and this involves appreciation of and competence in 
diverse approaches to creating, manipulating, and communicating knowledge.
To assume that this integrated appreciation and competence can be achieved solely by 
distribution requirements or other legislative approaches is highly questionable. As with 
racial integration, we must closely scrutinize any strategy that requires students to do 
what we ourselves cannot or will not do. To build integrative programs of teaching and 
research requires that reward systems, selection and evaluation criteria, and inquiry values 
be confronted and adjusted to sustain interdisciplinary activity. In addition, some kind of 
focal point may be required for successful integrative education. Successful interdisciplin-
ary programs I have seen have had a common reference point for integrative activity. At 
Alverno College, a common reference point is the student’s development as a self-directed 
learner. The faculty have reconceptualized their liberal arts curriculum to focus on devel-
oping abilities, and have created classroom and off-campus learning experiences with 
sharp attention to the principles of experiential learning theory and practice (Doherty, 
Mentkowski, and Conrad, 1978). Results from longitudinal studies (Mentkowski and 
Strait, 1983) confirm that while students as a group enter college with predominant  
286 
Experiential Learning
preferences for some learning styles over others, they show equal preferences for the 
four styles two years later. They shift in their preferences from more concrete to more 
abstract and from more reflective to more active. These changes have been directly linked 
to student performance in the curriculum. This suggests that the environmental press of 
a college dedicated to experiential learning concepts can cause students to be more bal-
anced in their learning style preferences, and when they are ready to enter their specialized 
professional programs, they have already experienced multiple learning modes. Further, 
students as a group maintain their more balanced preferences during the last two years of 
college, even though practically all of them enter a particular career track. Type of major 
does not contribute to change. Further, alumnae report having to learn in a variety of 
modes at work, and being able to adapt to continued and unguided learning situations 
in a variety of settings (Mentkowski and Much, 1982). In the professions, this reference 
point is often the professional role itself, in which critical functions and tasks emphasize 
the need for specialized knowledge from various disciplines. In the “pure” academic dis-
ciplines, this focus can come through the broad application of a methodology such as 
systems analysis or through a research problem that requires multiple perspectives. In the 
humanities, this reference point may be experiential learning, a focus on the “common 
experiences of life,” reversing a trend toward theorizing and formal specialization that 
has, in the opinion of W. Jackson Bates, nearly destroyed the field. Bates calls this trend:
. . . the most serious liability that literary study has been gradually creating for 
itself: the autonomous nature of literature (and the arts) as a separate preserve 
apart from the common experiences of life. Hazlitt had a point when he said that 
the arts resembled Antaeus in the fable, who was invincible as long as his feet 
touched his mother Earth, but who was easily strangled by Hercules once he was 
lifted from the strength-giving ground. [Bates, 1982, p. 52]
The “when” question may suggest even more fundamental changes. The continuing 
knowledge explosion and the corresponding rapid rate of change raise serious questions 
about the current strategy of “front-loading” educational experience in the individual’s 
life cycle. When, as current labor statistics indicate, the average person will change jobs 
seven times and careers three times during his or her working life, it makes more sense to 
distribute educational experiences throughout adult life in order to assist in the prepara-
tion for and mastery of these changes. Younger students will need to intersperse more 
life/work experience between their years of preparation in formal education. Existing 
programs of field-experience education (internships, work/study, and so on) give tes-
timony to the learning/development payoff of such a mix of academic and practical 
training (Hursh and Borzak, 1979). The older generation will need the adult work/study 
version of what used to be called a “liberal arts education” with fresh opportunities to 
harvest the many fruits of knowledge left behind on their respective climbs to the top. 
In this model, the university becomes a center for lifelong learning. Integrative learning 
experiences take on new meaning and vitality when they are directly connected with the 
287
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
integrative challenges of adult life. Discussions of human values and the quality of life 
are very different with high school graduates than they are with managers of an oil refin-
ery. Quality patient care has one connotation to the idealistic premed student and quite 
another to the harried medical specialist. Perhaps the richest resources for integrative 
development lie in the dialogue across age levels that the university for lifelong learning 
can provide.
Update and Reflections
Becoming an Experiential Educator
“To be a teacher in the right sense is to be a learner. Instruction  
begins when you, the teacher, learn from the learner, put yourself in 
his place so that you may understand what he understands and in 
the way he understands it.”
 —Kierkegaard
My career as an educator, nearly fifty years since beginning as an assistant professor at 
MIT’s Sloan School of Management in 1965, has in a sense been a journey to become an 
experiential educator. After an inglorious and painful beginning, lecturing engineering 
management students about organizational psychology in my first semester, I began 
searching for a better way to teach and help students learn. As I mentioned in the intro-
duction, the powerful learning I had experienced in Lewin’s experiential T-groups stood 
in sharp contrast to the bored and disinterested audiences I had faced that first semester. 
With my colleagues Irv Rubin and Jim McIntyre we began an exciting process of experi-
menting with experiential learning methods, first using T-groups but soon modifying 
our approach to use the experiential learning cycle to create more structured experi-
ential exercises that focused on the subject matter topics of organizational psychology. 
This resulted in the first management textbook based on experiential learning (Kolb, 
Rubin, and McIntyre, 1971b) that is now in its eighth edition (Osland, Kolb, Rubin, and 
Turner, 2007). The workbook provides simulations, role plays, and exercises (concrete 
experiences) that focus on central concepts in organizational behavior, providing a com-
mon experiential starting point for participants and faculty to explore the relevance of 
behavioral concepts for their work. Each chapter is organized around the learning cycle 
providing the experience, structured reflection and conversation exercises, conceptual 
material, and personal application assignments.
Our success with this work began what, for me, has been a lifelong fascination with how 
people learn and how as an educator I can facilitate their learning. Unlike most educators

who have a primary subject matter interest other than learning and education, for me 
how people learn was my primary focus in both my research and practice of teaching. 
Thus my career has been a lifelong series of action research projects. Three concepts have 
become central for me in my quest to become an experiential educator:
 
■	 Creating spaces for learning
 
■	 Dynamic matching of individual learning style and subject matter requirements 
by “teaching around the learning cycle”
 
■	 Focusing on the development of learning skills 
Learning Spaces
In experiential learning theory, learning is conceived as a transaction between the person 
and the environment. To learn means to learn something that exists somewhere. While, 
for most, the idea of a learning space conjures up the image of the physical classroom 
environment, the concept of learning space is much broader and multidimensional (Fig-
ure 7.17). Dimensions of learning space include physical, cultural, institutional, social, 
and psychological aspects. 
• Learning style
• Learning skills
• Values
• Peers
• Teachers
• Community members
• Policy
• Organization goals
• Traditions
• Values
• Norms and History

Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
In experiential learning theory these dimensions of learning space all come together 
in the experience of the learner. This concept of learning space builds on Kurt Lewin’s 
(1951) field theory and his concept of life space. For Lewin, the person and the envi-
ronment are interdependent variables, a concept Lewin translated into a mathemati-
cal formula, B = f(p, e) where behavior is a function of person and environment. As 
Marrow puts it, “the life space is the total psychological environment which the person 
experiences subjectively” (1969, p. 35). Life space includes all facts which have existence 
for the person and excludes those which do not. It embraces needs, goals, unconscious 
influences, memories, beliefs, events of a political, economic, and social nature, and 
anything else that might have a direct effect on behavior. To take time as an example, 
in many organizations today employees are so busy doing their work that they feel that 
there is no time to learn how to do things better. This feeling is shaped by the objective 
conditions of a hectic work schedule and also the expectation that time spent reflecting 
will not be rewarded. Teachers objectively create learning spaces by the information 
and activities they offer in their course; but this space is also interpreted in the students’ 
subjective experience through the lens of their learning style. One’s position in a learning 
space defines their experience and thus defines their “reality.” Lewin stresses the impor-
tance for education of defining the learning space in terms of the learner’s experience: 
“One of the basic characteristics of field theory in psychology, as I see it, is the demand 
that the field which influences an individual should be described not in ‘objective  
physicalistic’ terms, but in the way that it exists for that person at that time. . . . A teacher 
will never succeed in giving proper guidance to a child if he does not learn to understand 
the psychological world in which that child lives. . . . To substitute for that world of the 
individual the world of the teacher, of the physicist, or of anybody else is to be, not objec-
tive, but wrong” (Cartwright, 1951, p. 62).
The various factors in a given life space are to some degree interdependent, and Lewin 
strongly maintains that only the dynamic concepts of tension and force can deal with 
these sets of interdependent facts. This is what led him to define psychological needs 
as tension systems and their topological representation as vectors to denote motion. 
He postulates that the particular organization of a person’s life space is determined by 
a field of forces, both internal needs and external demands that position the individual 
in a life space composed of different regions. Using map-like representation, the life 
space could be depicted topologically. Life spaces can vary in a number of dimensions 
including extension, differentiation, integration, and level of conflict. Lewin introduced 
a number of concepts for analysis of the life space and a person’s relationship to it that 
are applicable to the study of learning spaces, including position, region, locomotion, 
equilibrium of forces, positive and negative valence, barriers in the person and the world, 
conflict, and goal. 
Urie Bronfrenbrenner’s (1977, 1979) work on the ecology of human development 
has made significant sociological contributions to Lewin’s life space concept. He 
290 
Experiential Learning
defines the ecology of learning/development spaces as a topologically nested arrange-
ment of structures each contained within the next. The learner’s immediate set-
ting such as a course or classroom is called the microsystem, while other concurrent 
settings in the person’s life such as other courses, the dorm, or family are referred 
to as the mesosystem. The exosystem encompasses the formal and informal social 
structures that influence the person’s immediate environment, such as institutional 
policies and procedures and campus culture. Finally, the macrosystem refers to the  
overarching institutional patterns and values of the wider culture, such as cultural 
values favoring abstract knowledge over practical knowledge, that influence actors in 
the person’s immediate microsystem and mesosystem. This theory provides a frame-
work for analysis of the social system factors that influence learners’ experience of 
their learning spaces.
Another important contribution to the learning space concept is situated learning 
theory (Lave and Wenger, 1991). Like experiential learning theory, situated learning 
theory draws on Vygotsky’s (1978) activity theory of social cognition for a conception 
of social knowledge that conceives of learning as a transaction between the person and 
the social environment. Situations in situated learning theory, like life space and learn-
ing space, are not necessarily physical places but constructs of the person’s experience 
in the social environment. These situations are embedded in communities of prac-
tice that have a history, norms, tools, and traditions of practice. Knowledge resides, 
not in the individual’s head, but in communities of practice. Learning is thus a pro-
cess of becoming a member of a community of practice through legitimate peripheral 
participation (e.g., apprenticeship). Situated learning theory enriches the learning 
space concept by reminding us that learning spaces extend beyond the teacher and 
the classroom. They include socialization into a wider community of practice that 
involves membership, identity formation, transitioning from novice to expert through 
mentorship, and experience in the activities of the practice, as well as the reproduc-
tion and development of the community of practice itself as newcomers replace  
old-timers.
Finally, as I described earlier (Chapter 5 Update and Reflections) in their theory 
of knowledge creation, Nonaka and Konno introduce the Japanese concept of ba, 
a “context that harbors meaning,” which is a shared space that is the foundation 
for knowledge creation. “Knowledge is embedded in ba, where it is then acquired 
through one’s own experience or reflections on the experiences of others” (1998, 
p. 40). Knowledge embedded in ba is tacit and can only be made explicit through 
sharing of feelings, thoughts, and experiences of persons in the space. For this to 
happen, the ba space requires that individuals remove barriers between one another 
in a climate that emphasizes “care, love, trust, and commitment.” Learning spaces 
similarly require norms of psychological safety, serious purpose, and respect to  
promote learning.

Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
Assessing Experiential Learning Spaces  
with the Kolb Learning Style Inventory 4.0
In experiential learning theory the experiential learning space is defined by the attracting 
and repelling forces (positive and negative valences) of the poles of the dual dialectics of 
action/reflection and experiencing/conceptualizing, creating a two-dimensional map of 
the regions of the learning space. The regions of the experiential learning theory learning 
space offer a typology of the different types of learning thereby emphasizing some stages 
of the learning cycle over others. The process of experiential learning can be viewed as 
a process of locomotion through the learning regions that is influenced by a person’s 
position in the learning space. Research on learning flexibility (Chapter 4 Update and 
Reflections, and Figure 4.16) has shown that individuals vary in their ability to move 
about the learning space.
The experiential learning theory learning space concept emphasizes that learning is not 
one universal process but a map of learning territories, a frame of reference within which 
many different ways of learning can flourish and interrelate. It is a holistic framework 
that orients the many different ways of learning to one another. As Lewin put it, “Actu-
ally, the term learning refers to a multitude of different phenomena. The statement 
‘Democracy, one has to learn, autocracy is imposed on the person’ refers to one type of 
learning. If one says that the spastic child has to learn to relax, one is speaking of a dif-
ferent type of learning. Both types probably have very little to do with learning French 
vocabulary, and this type again has little to do with learning to like spinach. Have we 
any right to classify learning to high-jump, to get along with alcohol, and to be friendly 
with people under the same terms, and to expect identical laws to hold for any of these 
processes?” (Cartwright, 1951, p. 65).
One’s position in the learning space defines their experience and thus defines their 
“reality.” Since a learning space is in the end what the learner experiences it to be, it 
is the psychological and social dimensions of learning spaces that have the most  
influence on learning. From this perspective learning spaces can be viewed as aggregates 
of the characteristics of the people in them since the people in a particular environ-
ment are arguably the dominant feature of it. “Environments are transmitted through 
people, and the dominant features of a particular environment are partially a function 
of the individuals who inhabit it” (Strange and Banning, 2001). An individual’s learn-
ing style (Chapter 4 Update and Reflections) positions him/her in one of these regions 
based on their unique equilibrium of forces among acting, reflecting, experiencing, and  
conceptualizing. A number of studies of learning spaces in higher education have been 
conducted using the human aggregate approach by showing the percentage of students 
whose learning style places them in the different learning space regions (Kolb and Kolb, 
2005a; Eickmann, Kolb, and Kolb, 2004).
Comparing Learning Spaces in Management and the Arts To illustrate the concept of 
learning space, the distribution of student learning styles in two institutions of higher 
292 
Experiential Learning
education that are engaged in longitudinal institutional development programs to pro-
mote learning—the Case Weatherhead School of Management (CWRU) MBA program 
and the Cleveland Institute of Art (CIA) undergraduate program—are shown in Figures 
7.18 and 7.19. The Case Weatherhead institutional development program, reported in 
Innovation in Professional Education: Steps on a Journey from Teaching to Learning (Boy-
atzis, Cowen, and Kolb, 1995), focused on curriculum development, student develop-
ment, and longitudinal outcome assessment (Boyatzis, Stubbs, and Taylor, 2002). MBA 
student learning style data is from Boyatzis and Mainemelis (2000). The program at the 
Cleveland Institute of Art is part of a longitudinal study of artistic learning conducted 
by the Ohio Consortium on Artistic Learning involving a longitudinal study of artistic 
learning styles, student development workshops, and faculty development seminars 
Eickmann, Kolb, and Kolb, 2004). 
Figures 7.18 and 7.19 show how the learning styles of management and art students are 
distributed in the learning regions. Art students are concentrated in the experiencing-
oriented northern regions of the learning space while management students are concen-
trated in the thinking southern regions. The figures show that 42.1 percent of art students 
are in the northern regions while 23.6 percent are in the south, contrasted to 45.7 percent 
of management students located in the southern regions with 21.2 percent in the north. 
There are more art students in the eastern reflecting regions than in the western acting 
regions (35.2 percent to 26.3 percent) and more management students in the western act-
ing regions than the eastern reflecting regions (36.3 percent to 30.4 percent). Among art 
students the Deciding region is the least populated (3.7 percent) while the least populated 
region for management students is Imagining (5.1 percent). While 12.5 percent of art 
students are in the Balancing central region, only 10.2 percent of management students

are found there. Boyatzis and Mainemelis found significant correlations between abstract 
learning styles and grades and GMAT (full-time MBA sample, r = .16; part-time sample, 
r = .19), indicating a bias toward abstraction in evaluation and selection practices. For 
BFA graduates there was no relationship between grades and learning style.
The way the educational process is conducted in art schools and management schools 
reveals some striking differences that give insight into the nature of learning in the dif-
ferent learning regions. Dewey’s distinction between artistic and scientific learning helps 
us understand the difference between the kinds of learning that occur in art education 
and in management education:
The rhythm of loss of integration with environment and recovery of union not 
only persists in man, but becomes conscious with him; its conditions are mate-
rial out of which he forms purposes. Emotion is the conscious sign of a break, 
actual or impending. The discord is the occasion that induces reflection. Desire 
for restoration of the union converts mere emotion into interest in objects as 
conditions of realization of harmony. With the realization, material of reflection 
is incorporated into objects as their meaning. Since the artist cares in a peculiar 
way for the phase of experience in which union is achieved, he does not shun 
moments of resistance and tension. He rather cultivates them, not for their own 
sake but because of their potentialities, bringing to living consciousness an expe-
rience that is unified and total. In contrast with the person whose purpose is 
esthetic, the scientific man is interested in problems, in situations wherein tension 
between the matter of observation and of thought is marked. Of course he cares 
for their resolution. But he does not rest in it; he passes on to another problem 
using an attained solution only as a stepping stone on which to set on foot further 
inquiries.
294 
Experiential Learning
The difference between the esthetic and the intellectual is thus one of the places 
where emphasis falls in the constant rhythm that marks the interaction of the 
live creature with his surroundings. . . . Because of the comparative remoteness 
of his end, the scientific worker operates with symbols, words and mathematical 
signs. The artist does his thinking in the very qualitative media he works in, and 
the terms lie so close to the object that he is producing that they merge directly 
into it. [Dewey, 1934, pp. 15–16]
A first awareness of differences in the management and arts learning spaces came as we 
were preparing a learning style workshop for art students. We asked what readings we 
should give, and the Provost, Paul Eickmann, said, “You know, for art students learning 
is not text driven.” This stood in dramatic contrast with management education which is 
almost entirely organized around texts that deliver an authoritative scientific discourse. 
The scientific basis of the management curriculum was established in 1959 by an influ-
ential Carnegie Foundation report that sought to improve the intellectual respectability 
of management education by grounding it in three scientific disciplines: economics, 
mathematics, and behavioral science.
The text-driven approach of management education contrasts with the experiential 
learning process of demonstration-practice-production-critique that is used in most art 
classes. This process is repeated recursively in art education, while management educa-
tion is primarily discursive with each topic covered in a linear sequence with little recur-
sive repetition. Management education focuses on telling, while art education emphasizes 
showing. Management education tends to emphasize theory, while art education empha-
sizes integration of theory and practice. Art education focuses on the learners’ inside-out 
expression, while management education spends more time on outside-in impression. 
Most of the time in management classes is spent conveying information, with relatively 
little time spent on student performance, most of which occurs on tests and papers. In 
art classes the majority of the time is spent on student expression of ideas and skills. Art 
education tends to be individualized, with small classes and individual attention, while 
management education is organized into large classes with limited individualized atten-
tion. An assistant dean at the Columbus College of Art and Design who majored in music 
as an undergraduate and later got an MBA contrasted the three hours a week he spent 
in individual tutorial with his mentor with the shock he experienced in entering a tiered 
MBA classroom of 200 students. Finally, art education tends to be represented by faculty 
members with diverse learning styles, whereas management education tends to favor spe-
cialized faculty members with a primarily abstract learning orientation (see Figure 7.20).
The comparison between the observed educational programs and teaching methods of 
CIA arts education and Case MBA education seems consistent with respective student 
LSI distributions in the nine-region learning space, with MBA students primarily in the 
southern thinking and western acting regions and arts students falling mainly in the 
northern feeling and eastern reflecting regions. The corresponding discursive, telling 
295
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
educational methods of the MBA program and the recursive, showing techniques of the 
art school recall Dewey’s description of the scientific worker who “operates with sym-
bols, words and mathematical signs” and the artist who “does his thinking in the very 
qualitative media he works in.”
Creating Learning Spaces for the Enhancement of Experiential Learning
From the very beginning, our work to introduce experiential learning in the educational 
systems has been a struggle to make the space for learning to take place. Educational 
institutions, with their classrooms, credit hours, and time-blocked schedules, are learn-
ing spaces; but spaces constructed with a very different model of learning than experi-
ential learning theory. Based on an information transfer model from teacher to student, 
classroom learning spaces are usually designed and often bolted down with seats in 
concrete tiers. Students face the teacher in front in a structure that makes student-to-
student interaction difficult. The university exosystem learning space of courses, broken 
down into block-scheduled bits of content that award credit hours for completion, sup-
ports the information transfer model. When Alice and I were teaching at CWRU, we 
used to joke that we were more furniture movers than teachers because we always had 
to arrive an hour early to move the tables aside and arrange chairs in a circle with books, 
materials, flowers, music, and other “show and tell” items in the center for everyone to 
see and interact with. Our goal was to create an experiential learning space based on the 
principles described below (Kolb and Kolb, 2005a).
Making Space for Engagement in the Learning Cycle The first step in creating an expe-
riential learning space is to make a space for learners that enables deep learning (Border, 
2007) by allowing them to fully engage in all four modes of the experiential learning 
cycle—experiencing, reflecting, thinking, and acting. Learning effectiveness is increased 
when one can move from one learning mode to the other in the learning cycle entering

the different corresponding regions of the learning space. Lewin used the term loco-
motion to describe this movement through the regions. He spoke of boundaries of the 
learning regions and how they can act as barriers to entering a region. Fazey and Martin 
(2002) have argued that learning leads to understanding with greater retention and 
transfer when an “experiential space of variation” is created through repeated practice 
from different perspectives and under different conditions. This space of variation can 
be portrayed as the number of learning regions that a person engages in the learning 
process. Another popular way of representing this idea is a learning pyramid where 
learning retention is increased from 20 percent when one learning mode is engaged to 
90 percent when all four modes are engaged (Reese 1998; Dale 1969). Although we have 
seen no studies that have assessed these retention percentages by learning mode empiri-
cally, Specht and Sandlin (1991) have shown that retention of accounting concepts after 
six weeks was 84 percent for students in a course taught using a learning method that 
followed the experiential learning cycle and only 46 percent in a course taught using the 
traditional lecture method.
We have seen a polarization between experiencing and thinking in the contrast between 
the feeling-oriented learning space of CIA arts education and the thinking-oriented 
learning spaces of the Case MBA program. It seems that educational institutions tend to 
develop a learning culture that emphasizes the learning mode most related to their edu-
cational objectives and devalues the opposite learning mode. Yet, Damasio (1994, 2003), 
LeDoux (1997), Zull (2002), and others offer convincing research evidence that reason 
and emotion are inextricably related in their influence on learning and memory. Indeed, 
it appears that feelings and emotions have primacy in determining whether and what 
we learn. Negative emotions such as fear and anxiety can block learning, while positive 
feelings of attraction and interest may be essential for learning. To learn something that 
one is not interested in is extremely difficult.
Learning is like breathing; it involves a taking in and processing of experience and a putting 
out or expression of what is learned. As Dewey noted, “. . . nothing takes root in mind when 
there is no balance between doing and receiving. Some decisive action is needed in order 
to establish contact with the realities of the world and in order that impressions may be so 
related to facts that their value is tested and organized” (1934, p. 45). Yet many programs 
in higher education are much more focused on impressing information on the mind of 
the learner than on opportunities for the learners to express and test in action what they 
have learned. Many courses will spend 15 weeks requiring students to take in volumes of 
information and only a couple of hours expressing and testing their learning, often on a 
multiple-choice exam. This is in contrast to arts education built on the demonstration-
practice-production-critique process where active expression and testing are continuously 
involved in the learning process. Zull (2002) suggests that action may be the most important 
part of the learning cycle because it closes the learning cycle by bringing the inside world of 
reflection and thought into contact with the outside world of experiences created by action. 
297
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
Respect for Learners and Their Experience We refer to this as the Cheers/Jeers expe-
riential continuum. At one end learners feel that they are members of a learning com-
munity who are known and respected by faculty and colleagues and whose experience is 
taken seriously, a space “where everybody knows your name.” At the other extreme are 
learning environments where learners feel alienated, alone, unrecognized, and devalued. 
Learning and growth in the Jeers environment “where nobody knows your name” can be 
difficult if not impossible. While this principle may seem obvious or even “preachy,” it 
is problematic for even the finest educational institutions. President Lawrence Summers 
of Harvard dedicated his 2003 commencement address to the introduction of a com-
prehensive examination of the undergraduate program, motivated in part by a letter he 
received from a top science student which contained the statement, “I am in the eighth 
semester of college and there is not a single science professor here who could identify 
me by name.” Summers concludes, “The only true measure of a successful educational 
model is our students’ experience of it” (Summers, 2003, p. 64).
Begin Learning with the Learner’s Experience of the Subject Matter  To learn experi-
entially, one must first of all own and value their experience. Students will often say, “But 
I don’t have any experience,” meaning that they don’t believe that their experience is of 
any value to the teacher or for learning the subject matter at hand. The new science of 
learning (Bransford, Brown, and Cocking, 2000) is based on the cognitive constructivist 
theories of Piaget and Vygotsky that emphasize that people construct new knowledge 
and understanding from what they already know and believe based on their previous 
experience. Zull (2002) suggests that this prior knowledge exists in the brain as neuronal 
networks which cannot be erased by a teacher’s cogent explanation. Instead, the effective 
teacher builds on exploration of what students already know and believe, on the sense 
they have made of their previous concrete experiences. Beginning with these or related 
concrete experiences allows the learner to re-examine and modify their previous sense-
making in the light of new ideas.
Creating and Holding a Hospitable Space for Learning  To learn requires facing and 
embracing differences, be they differences between skilled expert performance and one’s 
novice status, differences between deeply held ideas and beliefs and new ideas, or dif-
ferences in the life experience and values of others that can lead to understanding them. 
These differences can be challenging and threatening, requiring a learning space that 
encourages the expression of differences and the psychological safety to support the 
learner in facing these challenges (Sanford, 1966). As Robert Kegan says, “. . . people 
grow best where they continuously experience an ingenious blend of challenge and sup-
port” (1994, p. 42). As Kegan implies by his use of the term “ingenious blend,” creating 
and holding this learning space is not easy. He notes that while educational institutions 
have been quite successful in challenging students, they have been much less successful 
in providing support. One reason for this may be that challenges tend to be specific and 
immediate while support must go beyond an immediate “You can do it” statement. It 
298 
Experiential Learning
requires a climate or culture of support that the learner can trust to “hold” them over 
time. In Conversational Learning (Baker, Jensen, and Kolb, 2002) we draw on the work of 
Henri Nouwen (1975) and Parker Palmer (1983, 1990, 1998) to describe this challenging 
and supportive learning space as one that welcomes the stranger in a spirit of hospitality 
where “students and teachers can enter into a fearless communication with each other 
and allow their respective life experiences to be their primary and most valuable source 
of growth and maturation” (Nouwen, 1975, p. 60). 
Making Space for Conversational Learning  Human beings naturally make meaning 
from their experiences through conversation, yet genuine conversation in the traditional 
lecture classroom can be extremely restricted or nonexistent. At the break or end of the 
class the sometimes painfully silent classroom will suddenly come alive with spontane-
ous conversation among students. Significant learning can occur in these conversations, 
although it may not always be the learning the teacher intended. Making space for good 
conversation as part of the educational process provides the opportunity for reflection on 
and meaning making about experiences that improves the effectiveness of experiential 
learning (Keeton, Sheckley, and Griggs, 2002; Bunker 1999). For example, the creation 
of learning teams as part of a course promotes effective learning when psychologically 
safe conditions are present (Wyss-Flamm, 2002). Conversational Learning describes the 
dimensions of spaces that allow for good conversation. Good conversation is more likely 
to occur in spaces that integrate thinking and feeling, talking and listening, leadership 
and solidarity, recognition of individuality and relatedness, and discursive and recursive 
processes. When the conversational space is dominated by one extreme of these dimen-
sions, for example talking without listening, conversational learning is diminished.
Making Space for Development of Expertise  With vast knowledge bases that are ever 
changing and growing in every field, many higher education curricula consist of course 
after course “covering” a series of topics in a relatively superficial factual way. Yet as the 
National Research Council in its report on the new science of learning recommends on the 
basis of research on expert learners, effective learning requires not only factual knowledge, 
but the organization of these facts and ideas in a conceptual framework and the ability to 
retrieve knowledge for application and transfer to different contexts (Bransford, Brown, 
and Cocking, 2000). Such deep learning is facilitated by deliberate, recursive practice on 
areas that are related to the learner’s goals (Keeton, Sheckley, and Griggs, 2002). The pro-
cess of learning depicted in the experiential learning cycle describes this recursive spiral 
of knowledge development. Space needs to be created in curricula for students to pursue 
such deep experiential learning in order to develop expertise related to their life purpose.
Making Space for Inside-out Learning David Hunt (1987, 1991) describes inside-
out learning as a process of beginning with oneself in learning by focusing on one’s 
experienced knowledge: the implicit theories, metaphors, interests, desires, and goals 
that guide experience. Making space for inside-out learning by linking educational 
299
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
experiences to the learner’s interests kindles intrinsic motivation and increases learn-
ing effectiveness. Under the proper educational conditions, a spark of intrinsic interest 
can be nurtured into a flame of committed life purpose (Dewey, 1897). Yet learning 
spaces that emphasize extrinsic reward can drive out intrinsically motivated learning 
(Kohn, 1993; Deci and Ryan, 1985; Ryan and Deci, 2000). Long ago Dewey described 
the trend toward emphasis on extrinsic reward in education and the consequences for 
the teacher who wields the carrot and stick: “Thus in education we have that systematic 
depreciation of interest which has been noted. . . . Thus we have the spectacle of profes-
sional educators decrying appeal to interest while they uphold with great dignity the 
need of reliance upon examinations, marks, promotions and emotions, prizes and the 
time honored paraphernalia of rewards and punishments. The effect of this situation in 
crippling the teacher’s sense of humor has not received the attention which it deserves” 
(1916, p. 336).
Making Space for Learners to Take Charge of Their Own Learning  Many students 
enter higher education conditioned by their previous educational experiences to be pas-
sive recipients of what they are taught. Making space for students to take control of and 
responsibility for their learning can greatly enhance their ability to learn from experi-
ence. Some use the term self-authorship to describe this process of constructing one’s 
own knowledge versus passively receiving knowledge from others, considering self-
authorship to be a major aim of education (Kegan, 1994; King, 2003; Baxter-Magolda, 
1999). Others describe this goal as increasing students’ capacity for self-direction (Boy-
atzis, 1994; Robertson, 1988). The Management Development and Assessment course 
in the Case MBA program aims to develop student self-direction through assessment 
and feedback on learning skills and competencies and the development of a learning 
plan to achieve their career/life goals (Boyatzis, 1994). Bransford, Brown, and Cocking 
(2000) argue for the development of meta-cognitive skills to promote active learning. 
By developing their effectiveness as learners (Keeton, Sheckley, and Griggs, 2002), stu-
dents can be empowered to take responsibility for their own learning by understanding 
how they learn best and the skills necessary to learn in regions that are uncomfortable 
for them. Workshops on experiential learning and learning styles can help students to 
develop meta-cognitive learning skills. At CIA and the Case undergraduate programs, 
student workshops help students interpret their LSI scores and understand how to use 
this information to improve their learning effectiveness. John Reese at the University of 
Denver Law School conducts “Connecting with the Professor” workshops in which stu-
dents select one of four teaching styles based on the four predominant learning styles that 
they have difficulty connecting with. The workshop gives multiple examples of remedial 
actions that the learner may take to correct the misconnection created by differences in 
teaching/learning styles. Peer group discussions among law students give an opportunity 
to create new ideas about how to get the most from professors with different learning/
teaching styles (Reese, 1998).

Experiential Learning
Educator Roles and Teaching Around the Learning Cycle
In the midst of the multitude of educational theories, learning technologies, and institu-
tional procedures and constraints, it is easy to lose sight of the most important thing—
teaching is above all a profound human relationship. We can all think of teachers who 
have had a major impact on our lives, and in most cases this involved a special relation-
ship where we felt recognized, valued, and empowered by the teacher. Parker Palmer 
(1998) described the courage necessary for a teacher to fully enter into learning rela-
tionships with students as a willingness to expose one’s inner world, to honor students 
as complex, relational beings, and to masterfully weave these worlds together with the 
course content. Experiential learning theory suggests that educating is not something 
one does to students through implementation of a set of techniques. Rather, it is some-
thing educators do with learners in the context of meaningful relationships and shared 
experiences. 
Educating is holistic. It is about developing the whole person. Educating the whole per-
son means that the goal of education is not solely cognitive knowledge of the facts, but 
also includes development of social and emotional maturity. In experiential learning the-
ory terms it is about facilitating integrated development in affective, perceptual, cogni-
tive, and behavioral realms. Rather than acquiring generalized knowledge stripped of any 
context, learning is situated to the person’s life setting and life path (Lave and Wenger, 
1991). The experiential educator needs to resolve some fundamental dilemmas of teach-
ing. Do we focus on the learner’s experience and interests or subject matter require-
ments? Do we focus on effective performance and action or on a deep understanding 
of the meaning of ideas? All are required for maximally effective learning. Experiential 
education is a complex relational process that involves balancing attention to the learner 
and to the subject matter while also balancing reflection on the deep meaning of ideas 
with the skill of applying them. It is important to be learner centered, focusing on the 
prior knowledge of learners to help them construct new understanding and tapping into 
their unique interests to increase motivation to learn. It is also important to be subject 
centered, staying on top of one’s field and organizing subject matter in a form that can 
be communicated effectively. Similarly, it is necessary to explore the deeper meaning of 
ideas and develop learners’ ability to critically evaluate the assumptions that underlie 
them, while also focusing on performance, the effective application of the ideas.
The simple prescription, made by many learning style approaches to match teach-
ing style to the learning style of learners, is not sufficient to deal with this complexity 
(Pashler et al., 2008; Willingham, 2005, 2009). Unlike the experiential learning theory 
process-oriented learning style approach, these style measures see learning styles as fixed 
traits or personality characteristics. Scott, citing Dweck (2000), argues that this is an 
entity approach to ability that promotes stereotyping and labeling rather than a process 
approach that emphasizes developmental potential and contextual adaptation. Also, 
surprisingly, none are based on a comprehensive theory of learning. The dimensions of 
301
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
individuality that they assess are hypothesized to influence learning, but how the dimen-
sion connected to the learning process is not made explicit. An individual may prefer to 
work alone or in a group, but how is this preference related to learning?
Willingham provides an example of the problems that a trait-based learning style mea-
sure that is not related to a theory of learning faces with the matching teaching and learn-
ing style approach. The VAK measures individual differences in preferences for visual, 
auditory, and kinesthetic sense modalities. While there are reliable individual differences 
in preference/ability for these modalities, “For the vast majority of education, vision 
and audition are usually just vehicles that carry the important information teachers 
want students to learn” (2005, p. 3). But the process of learning usually involves storing 
information in memory in terms of meaning, independent of any modality. His review 
of studies that match sensory modality with instruction concludes: “We can say that the 
possible effects of matching instructional modality to a student’s modality strength have 
been extensively studied and have yielded no positive evidence” (2005, p. 3).
The major implication of experiential learning theory for education is to design educa-
tional programs in a way that teaches around the learning cycle so that learners can use 
and develop all learning styles in a way that completes the learning cycle for them and 
promotes deep learning. Earlier (Chapter 1 Update and Reflections, pp. 26–27) I described 
Vygotsky’s law of internalization and the zone of proximal development where the child’s 
novel capacities begin in the interpersonal realm and are gradually transferred into the 
intrapersonal realm (Vygotsky, 1978). The key technique for accomplishing this transi-
tion is called “scaffolding.” In scaffolding the educator tailors the learning process to the 
individual needs and developmental level of the learner. Scaffolding provides the structure 
and support necessary to progressively build knowledge. The model of teaching around 
the cycle described below provides a framework for this scaffolding process. This approach 
requires competence in relating to learners in complex ways—ways that help them feel, 
perceive, think, and behave differently. These ways of relating require the educator to play 
multiple roles in relationship to the learners and the object of the learning endeavor. 
In our interviews and observations of experienced, successful educators we find that they 
tend to “teach around the learning cycle” in this manner. They organize their educational 
activities in such a manner that they address all four learning modes—experiencing, reflect-
ing, thinking, and acting. As they do this, they lead learners around the cycle, shifting the 
role they play depending on which stage of the cycle they are addressing. In effect the role 
they adopt helps to create a learning space designed to facilitate the transition from one 
learning style to another. Often they do this in a recursive fashion, repeating the cycle 
many times in a learning program. In effect the cycle becomes a spiral with each passage 
through the cycle deepening and extending learners’ understanding of the subject. When a 
concrete experience is enriched by reflection, given meaning by thinking, and transformed 
by action, the new experience created becomes richer, broader, and deeper. Further itera-
tions of the cycle continue the exploration and transfer to experiences in other contexts.
302 
Experiential Learning
The New Zealand Ministry of Education (2004) has used this spiraling learning process 
as the framework for the design of middle school curricula. Figure 7.21 describes how 
teachers use the learning spiral to promote higher level learning and to transfer knowl-
edge to other contexts.
Educator Roles 
Teaching around the learning cycle and to different learning styles introduces the need 
for adjustments in the role one takes with learners. The Educator Role Profile (Kolb, 
Kolb, Passarelli, and Sharma, 2014) was created to help educators understand their pre-
ferred educator role and plan for how they can teach around the learning cycle. The self-
report instrument is based on the assumption that preferences for teaching roles emerge 
from a combination of beliefs about teaching and learning, goals for the educational pro-
cess, preferred teaching style, and instructional practices. Educator roles are not limited

to individuals in formal classroom teaching situations. The framework can be extended 
to individuals in all walks of life who “teach” as leaders, coaches, parents, friends, etc.
An educator role is a patterned set of behaviors that emerge in response to the learning 
environment, including students and the learning task demands. Each educator role 
engages students to learn in a unique manner, using one mode of grasping experience 
and one mode of transforming experience. In the facilitator role, educators draw on the 
modes of concrete experience and reflective observation to help learners get in touch 
with their own experience and reflect on it. Subject matter experts, using the modes of 
reflective observation and abstract conceptualization, help learners organize and connect 
their reflection to the knowledge base of the subject matter. They may provide models or 
theories for learners to use in subsequent analysis. The standard setting and evaluating 
role uses abstract conceptualization and active experimentation to help students apply 
knowledge toward performance goals. In this role, educators closely monitor the quality 
of student performance toward the standards they set, and provide consistent feedback. 
Finally, those in the coaching role draw on concrete experience and active experimenta-
tion to help learners take action on personally meaningful goals. These roles can also 
be organized by their relative focus on the student versus the subject and action versus 
knowledge as illustrated in Figure 7.22.

Experiential Learning
The Educator Role Profile (ERP) describes four role positions—Facilitator, Expert, Eval-
uator, and Coach. Educators play these roles as they help learners maximize learning by 
moving through the four stages of the experiential learning cycle.
 
■ The Facilitator Role. When facilitating, educators help learners get in touch with 
their personal experience and reflect on it. They adopt a warm affirming style to 
draw out learners’ interests, intrinsic motivation, and self-knowledge. They often 
do this by facilitating conversation in small groups. They create personal rela-
tionships with learners.
 
■ The Expert Role. In their role as subject expert, educators help learners organize 
and connect their reflections to the knowledge base of the subject matter. They 
adopt an authoritative, reflective style. They often teach by example, modeling 
and encouraging critical thinking as they systematically organize and analyze 
the subject matter knowledge. This knowledge is often communicated through 
lectures and texts.
 
■ The Evaluator Role. As a standard setter and evaluator, educators help learn-
ers master the application of knowledge and skill in order to meet performance 
requirements. They adopt an objective, results-oriented style as they set the 
knowledge requirements needed for quality performance. They create perfor-
mance activities for learners to evaluate their learning.
 
■ The Coaching Role. In the coaching role, educators help learners apply knowl-
edge to achieve their goals. They adopt a collaborative, encouraging style, often 
working one-on-one with individuals to help them learn from experiences in 
their life context. They assist in the creation of personal development plans and 
provide ways of getting feedback on performance. 
Educating Around the Experiential Learning Cycle
Figure 7.23 shows the nine-style experiential learning cycle and the corresponding edu-
cator roles that match them; for example, the coach role is most appropriate for the 
experiencing, initiating, and acting styles, while the facilitator role connects with the 
experiencing, imagining, and reflecting styles. Learning style is not a fixed personal-
ity trait but more like a habit of learning shaped by experience and choices—it can be 
an automatic, unconscious mode of adapting, or it can be consciously modified and 
changed. The dynamic matching model suggests that matching style with role is impor-
tant to connect with and engage learners. Raschick, Mypole, and Day (1998) found that 
social work students whose learning styles were similar to their field supervisors along 
the active experimentation-reflective observation continuum would rate their field expe-
rience with them higher. The authors suggest that the finding is most relevant for the 
supervisors at the beginning point of the learning cycle, when matching their teaching 
techniques to learners’ preferences offers encouragement to move through the rest of the 
305
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
learning cycle. Individual learning styles can be an entry point through which learners 
enter a particular learning space, but most learning requires that they continue to actively 
move around the learning cycle using other learning styles to acquire increasingly com-
plex knowledge and skills and capacity to adapt to the wider demands of a given learning 
environment.
While Figure 7.23 depicts an idealized sequential progression through the educator roles 
and learning styles, in most cases a curriculum design will be based on a sequence of 
activities and instructional techniques that fits the subject matter and learning objectives 
that may or may not fit such an orderly progression. In considering a design it is useful to 
consider for each segment the teaching role to adopt, the learning style that you want to 
engage, and the choice of instructional technique best suited to the learning style and role. 
Educator Role Flexibility
Individuals, however, tend to have a definite preference for one or two roles over the oth-
ers because of their educational philosophy, their personal teaching style, and the require-
ments of their particular educational setting including administrative mandates and 
learner needs. The dynamic matching model recognizes that educators have individual

role preferences and learners have preferred learning styles, but also, that both can develop 
the capacity to adapt their respective roles and styles to one another and the learning 
situation at hand. Using the Educator Role Profile (Kolb, Kolb, Passarelli, and Sharma, 
2014) we find that to some extent educators do tend to teach the way they learn, finding 
that those with concrete learning styles are more learner-centered, preferring the facilita-
tor role, while those with abstract learning styles are more subject-centered preferring 
the expert and evaluator roles. However, with practice both learners and educators can 
develop the flexibility to use all roles and styles to create a more powerful and effective 
process of teaching and learning. Kosower and Berman argue that faculty members are 
capable of learning to teach in ways that are incongruent with their own learning styles, 
“because we all engage in all of the strategies to some degree, it seems to be more a matter 
of willingness to learn rather than ability” (1996, p. 217). Baker, Simon, and Bazeli (1987) 
contend that teaching is an art requiring the instructor to select from among a wide vari-
ety of instructional strategies to reach students with a diversity of learning preferences. 
Milne, James, Keegan, and Dudley (2002) developed an observational method to assess 
mental health trainers’ transaction patterns along with their impact on student learning 
and a training program designed to teach trainers to teach to all learning modes. The 
results of the study indicate that during the baseline phase, the observed teaching method 
was primarily didactic in nature and accounted for the greatest impact (46.4 percent) on 
learner behavior in the reflection mode of the learning cycle, followed by smaller over-
all impacts on the remaining phases of the cycle. In the intervention phase by contrast, 
the greatest impact of the trainer’s behavior on learners was on the concrete experience 
(59.5 percent), followed by reflective observation (33 percent), and active experimenta-
tion (4.5 percent) phases of the learning cycle. The authors conclude that the intervention 
phase produced trainer’s behaviors that promote learners’ ability to take advantage of the 
full range of the experiential learning cycle thus maximizing their learning outcomes. As 
education becomes more learner-centered, Harrelson and Leaver-Dunn (2002) suggest 
that experiential learning requires that teachers assume the facilitator role, which might 
be a difficult mind-set for some.
Lipshitz (1983) underscores the complexity of roles for an experiential educator who 
needs to have a firm grasp of the relevant conceptual material and develop sensitivity 
and skill in managing learners’ emotional reactions to the learning process. Learners 
may also react to the shifting role of the educator from that of a knowledge purveyor to 
one that creates the learning environment and facilitates the holistic learning process. 
McGoldrick, Battle, and Gallagher (2000) indicate that the less control instructors exert 
on the students’ experiences the more effective the learning outcome will be. However, 
instructors may run the risk of losing control over course structure and failing to keep 
the learning activities bounded within a specific time frame. Most of the risks associated 
with the experiential method, contend the authors, can be mitigated through careful 
planning, unambiguous course structure, establishing of clear expectations, and firm 
deadlines for each class activity. 
307
Chapter 7 Learning and Development in Higher Education 
Learning Style Flexibility
Learners have differing levels of interest as well as difficulties with certain stages of 
the learning cycle. Studies do show, however, that learners are able to flex their learn-
ing styles according to the demand of different learning tasks. Several studies suggest 
that, in fact, students shift their learning strategies to match the learning demands of 
a particular discipline (Cornett, 1983; Entwistle, 1981; Kolb, 1984; Ornstein, 1977). 
Jones, Mokhtari, and Reichard (2003) examined the extent to which community col-
lege students’ learning style preferences vary as a function of discipline. They found 
significant differences in students’ learning style preference across four different subject-
area disciplines: English, math, science, and social studies. The results indicate that 83 
percent of the 103 participants switched learning styles for two or more disciplines 
suggesting that students are capable of flexing their learning strategies to respond to 
the discipline-specific learning requirements. By understanding the dynamic matching 
model, they can become more capable of deliberate experiential learning (Kolb and 
Yeganah, 2016).
Outcome Assessment and Learning Skills
While experiential learning theory emphasizes that learning is an ongoing process, it does 
not mean that outcomes of learning are unimportant. Rather, it views much assessment 
in education as problematic because it is overly focused on declarative content knowledge 
rather than learning skills; and it is not holistic, focused primarily on information and 
cognitive skills while neglecting interpersonal and action skills. Experiential Learning uses 
the adaptive competency circle to assess outcomes of professional education and their 
correspondence with current job demands (Chapter 7, pp. 268–276). This instrument 
was based on relationships established between adaptive comptencies and learning style 
that arrayed them around the learning cycle (Chapter 4, pp. 131–134). Based on this work 
Boyatzis and Kolb (1995, 1997) developed and validated the Learning Skills Profile (LSP). 
A learning skill is a combination of ability, knowledge, and experience that enables 
someone to do something well in a specific context. Learning skills can be intentionally 
developed by practice. Like the adaptive competency circle, learning skills are arrayed 
around the learning cycle based on their relationship to learning style. The LSP contains 
72 learning skills in 12 scales of a “learning cycle clock.” The four learning modes encom-
pass three scales each. CE includes interpersonal skills of leadership (11), relationship 
(12), and help (1). RO includes information skills of sense making (2), information gath-
ering (3), and information analysis (4). AC includes analytical skills of theory building 
(5), quantitative analysis (6), and technology (7). AE includes behavioral skills of goal 
setting (8), action (9), and initiative (10). The LSP was validated by a confirmative fac-
tor analysis of the scales that determined their fit in the four learning mode categories 
(Kaskowitz, 1995), examination of scale intercorrelations, relationship to the LSI, and 
correspondence to supervisor ratings (Boyatzis and Kolb, 1995). The LSP items are rated 
308 
Experiential Learning
on a 7-point scale and can be adapted to self ratings of one’s skill and job demands and 
also in a “360” format where the skill and job demands of an individual are rated by 
supervisors and/or peers.
The LSP has been used extensively for individual personal development and career plan-
ning. Figure 7.24 shows the learning skill profiles for two individuals. The woman on the 
left is a senior human resource development manager who is successful and loves her job. 
Note the correspondence between her job demands (the solid line) and learning skills 
(the dashed line) and the high levels of both. The profile on the right is an undergraduate 
man who is mapping the demands of his prospective major in biomedical engineering 
with his learning skills. Note the relative match between analytic demands and skills in 
the southern regions and the mismatch between high interpersonal skills and career 
demands in the north. This may be why he was questioning whether this major was the 
right choice. Sometimes when individuals take the LSP, they discover that their job is 
not using many of their highly developed skills. They are bored and restless, and that is 
a sign to search for new opportunities. Understanding your learning style and skills and 
the corresponding demands of different jobs and careers as described in the career chart 
can help you find that challenging match and a job you love.
The LSP has had a number of educational applications. Baker, Pesut, Mcdaniel, and 
Fisher (2007) evaluated a new problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum in graduate 
nursing education and a new PBL MBA program comparing before-and-after LSP results. 
Kretovics (1999) studied the graduating class of an MBA program in comparison to enter-
ing students and a control group finding changes in LSP scores that demonstrated the 
“added value” of the program. In Innovation in Professional Education (Boyatzis, Cowan, 
and Kolb, 1995) the LSP was used extensively to assess changes from entering to graduat-
ing MBA students. The instrument was also used to interview faculty about the learning 
skill objectives of their courses. Aggregate faculty scores on skill emphasis were related to 
student outcomes as measured by changes from entering to graduating students.
In health care, Rainey, Heckelman, Galazka, and Kolb (1993) used the LSP as a team-
building and faculty development tool in a family medicine department, while Smith 
(1990) used the LSP to assess the critical competencies of physician executives. The 
instrument has been used as a framework for describing managerial (Camuffo and Gerli, 
2004) and leadership skills (Kolb and Rainey, 2014). Dreyfus (1989) used the LSP to dif-
ferentiate the learning skills of high-performing and typical managers.
Yamazaki (2010e) and Yamazaki and Kayes (2010) have used the LSP extensively to 
study cross-cultural differences and ex-patriate cross-cultural adaptation (Yamazaki, 
2010a, 2010b, and 2010c; Yamazaki and Kayes, 2004, 2007).

But yield who will to their separation,
My object in living is to unite
My avocation and my vocation
As my two eyes make one in sight.
Only where love and need are one,
And the work is play for mortal stakes,
Is the deed ever really done
For Heaven and the future’s sakes.

here has been in recent years a dramatic preoccupation with adult development 
through the later stages of adult life driven by the huge baby boom demographic 
passing through them. This emphasis on adult learning and development has 
been labeled by some a “revolution in human development” (Brim and Kagan, 1980), 
and indeed, one cannot fail to be impressed by the burgeoning of self-development 
techniques and activities—from bookstores’ shelves crowded with self-help books to 
workshops ranging from AA to TA to TM to Zen. Although some see a dangerous cur-
rent of narcissism and “me” orientation in these developments, I prefer a more positive 
interpretation—namely, that the dialectic between social specialization and individual 
integrative fulfillment is itself reaching toward a higher-level synthesis.
The very diversity and intense specialization that threaten to tear us apart are grist for 
the integrative mill. Modern communication, the mass media, and the other fruits of

the information revolution provide an instantaneous cornucopia of fantasies, ideas, 
perspectives, value conflicts, and crises that challenge and fuel the integrative capacities 
of us all. We seek to grow and develop because we must do so to survive—as individuals 
and as a world community. If there is a touch of aggressive selfishness in our search for 
integrity, it can perhaps be understood as a response to the sometimes overwhelming 
pressures on us to conform, submit, and comply, to be the object rather than the subject 
of our life history.
The challenge of lifelong learning is above all a challenge of integrative development. 
Consider the careers of two great atomic scientists, the American Edward Teller and the 
Russian Andrei Sakharov, both of whom early in their careers were central in the develop-
ment of their countries’ nuclear capabilities. Teller went on to become one of our coun-
try’s foremost advocates of nuclear power and a strong defense, whereas Sakharov, who 
gave his country the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s, was stricken by conscience and became 
a political dissident and a vigorous defender of human rights. Eventually he was banished 
from Moscow for his protest against the presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan.
These moral and ethical decisions to promote or reject one’s own inventions, to support 
or protest against one’s own country, are qualitatively different from the specialized 
problem-solving activities of the working scientist. As Piaget (1970b) and others (such 
as Kuhn, 1962) have documented, the historical development of scientific knowledge 
has been toward increasing specialization, moving from egocentrism to reflection and 
from phenomenalism to constructivism—in experiential learning terms, from active to 
reflective and concrete to abstract. Yet the careers of highly successful scientists follow 
a different path. These people make their specialized abstract-reflective contributions 
often quite early in their careers. With recognition of their achievements comes a new 
set of tasks and challenges with active and concrete demands. The Nobel prizewinner 
must help to shape social policy and to articulate the ethical and value implications of 
his or her discoveries. The researcher becomes department chairperson and must man-
age the nurturance of the younger generation. So in this career, and most others as well, 
the higher levels of responsibility require an integrative perspective that can help shape 
cultural responses to emergent issues.
The challenges of integrative development are great, and not everyone is successful in 
meeting them, no matter how intelligent the person or how highly skilled in the profes-
sional specialty. In fact, as we have seen in Chapter 7, one’s professional specialization 
may inhibit development of an integrative perspective. Charles Darwin, in his autobiog-
raphy, was puzzled about his lost taste for literature, music, and the fine arts, suspecting 
that this loss was somehow related to his specialization:
My mind seems to have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out 
of large collections of facts, but why this should have caused the atrophy of that 
part of the brain alone, on which the highest tastes depend, I cannot conceive. 
[Darwin, 1958, pp. 138–139]

Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
Several observers have attributed the problems that Jimmy Carter encountered in his 
presidency to his strong professional identity as a scientist and engineer (Fallows, 1979; 
Pfaff, 1979) and his difficulties in adapting to the concrete and reflective demands of the 
presidency (Gypen, 1980). Clark Clifford, who has been a personal consultant and friend 
to several presidents, said of Carter:
He prided himself on being an engineer and scientist. . . . And every now and then 
he would say, “Now, as a scientist I would do this.” “As a scientist I would do that.” 
And he had good scientific training. What scientists do is, they start at A. And 
they go from A to B and B to C and C to D and D is their goal. And they know 
that if they just stay on the line, unquestionably they will reach D. I saw that in the 
President from time to time—that he had sufficient knowledge and experience 
to know that if he proceeded along a certain line the result would be there. The 
trouble is, it doesn’t work in the White House. Because it doesn’t take into con-
sideration the House of Representatives, or the Senate of the United States, or the 
media, or the American people. . . . All these other factors come in. The problems 
of the President of the United States are not susceptible to scientific treatment. 
There’s a lot more that goes into it. The fact is you almost have to disregard it. . . . 
President Carter came into the White House and after a while he got settled and 
began to feel more comfortable and began to look around for problems to solve. 
Well, one of them was the Panama Canal. . . . And that is a perfect issue for a presi-
dent to bring up in the third year of his second term when he can be a statesman. 
And he can say, “This is right.” And then he doesn’t have to worry about commit-
ments that he has made. But he picked this one out. Now, interestingly enough, 
he was right. . . . And courageous. But absolutely wrong to bring up at this time. 
Because he froze a very substantial part of the populace into a position of eternal 
and permanent enmity, as far as he was concerned. . . . A broader concept on his 
part of the presidency would have greatly facilitated that decision-making process. 
Another twenty-two water projects out in the West. . . . He took a look at that and 
my recollection is he said about 14 of these have no merit and maybe seven or 
eight have. Well, right about that time out went California, Oregon, Washington, 
Idaho, Montana, Colorado. [Bill Moyers Journal, 1981, pp. 6–7]
President Carter’s later successes suggest significant progress toward an integrative 
response to the demands of his office, particularly in achieving a Mideast agreement 
through personal diplomacy in the Camp David accords. The early years of his term, 
however, appear to have suffered because of his specialized scientific perspective.
But the challenges of integrative development are not limited to scientists and presidents. 
A recent Wall Street Journal survey of chief executives asked them to identify the main 
strengths that determine a manager’s potential for advancement (Allen, 1980). At the head 
of the list (cited by 36 percent of chief executives from large firms) was integrity, followed 
by an ability to get along with others and industriousness. Specialized technical experience 
314 
Experiential Learning
or education was mentioned by only a few as critical for success. In fact, there are integra-
tive developmental challenges in all occupations, at all occupational levels, and in our 
private lives as well. Many first-line supervisors, for example, have created personal job def-
initions that transcend the specialized boundaries of their trade to include the development 
of younger workers and the building of meaningful community and family relationships.
These challenges become particularly acute in midlife, when as adults we face what Erik-
son has termed the crisis of generativity or stagnation:
. . . For we are a teaching species. . . . Only man can and must extend his solici-
tude over the long parallel and overlapping childhoods of numerous offspring 
united in households and communities. As he transmits the rudiments of hope, 
will, purpose and skill, he imparts meaning to the child’s bodily experiences; he 
conveys a logic much beyond the literal meaning of the words he teaches; and 
he gradually outlines a particular world image and style of citizenship. . . . Once 
we have grasped this interlocking of the human life stages, we understand that 
adult man is so constituted as to need to be needed lest he suffer the mental 
deformation of self-absorption, in which he becomes his own infant and pet. I 
have, therefore, postulated an instinctual and psychosocial stage of generativity. 
Parenthood is, for most, the first, and for many, the prime generative encounter; 
yet the continuation of mankind challenges the generative ingenuity of workers 
and thinkers of many kinds. [Erikson, 1961, pp. 159–160]
In acceptance of the fact that we are a “teaching species” as well as a “learning species,” 
a kind of figure/ground reversal takes place at midlife. Our progressive independence 
from the care of others, our self-oriented pursuit of individual goals, fades from the 
foreground of our experience to be replaced by a growing concern for the care of others. 
In the process, other reversals occur as well. In Jung’s terms, the shadow side of personal-
ity emerges and claims dominion in consciousness along with the specialized conscious 
identity of youth. This is a social as well as personal transition, for many forces in the 
structure of career paths call for personal reassessment and integrative development. 
For example:
 
■ The career cul de sac—careers that provide advancement and opportunity only 
to a certain point and then require major adaptation and change, e.g., housewife/
mother or engineering.
 
■ Withdrawal of reward; e.g., up-or-out tenure systems.
 
■ Withdrawal of opportunity—organizational career paths that have few opportuni-
ties for advancement and responsibility at middle and upper levels.
 
■ The “fur-lined trap” and achievement addiction—organizational and career reward 
systems that so effectively reward specialized role performance that individuals 
have little energy remaining for broader development, family, and private life.
315
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
 
■ Career demands for integrative development—the extent to which a given career 
requires and/or allows development beyond specialization. For example, man-
agement at top levels requires an integrative perspective and organizations have 
policies such as job rotation to facilitate the development of this perspective.
 
■ Opportunities for creativity/role innovation (Schein, 1972)—the extent to which 
a career offers continuing challenges and opportunities for changing roles and 
job functions.
The developmental model of experiential learning theory holds that specialization of 
learning style typifies early adulthood and that the role demands of career and family are 
likely to reinforce specialization. However, this pattern changes in midcareer. Specifically, 
as people mature, accentuation forces play a smaller role. To the contrary, the approach 
of the middle years brings with it a questioning of one’s purposes and aspirations, a reas-
sessment of life structure and direction. For many, choices made earlier have led down 
pathways no longer rewarding, and some kind of change is needed. At this point, many 
finally face up to the fact that they will never realize their youthful dreams and that new, 
more realistic goals must be found if life is to have purpose. Others, even if success-
ful in their earlier pursuits, discover that they have purchased success in career at the 
expense of other responsibilities (such as to spouse and children) or other kinds of human 
fulfillment. Continued accentuation of an overspecialized version of oneself eventually 
becomes stultifying—one begins to feel stuck, static, in a rut. The vitality of earlier chal-
lenges is too easily replaced by routinized application of well-established solutions. In 
the absence of new and fresh challenges, creativity gives way to merely coping and going 
through the motions. Many careers plateau at this time, and one faces the prospect of 
drying up and stretching out the remaining years in tedium. Finding new directions for 
generativity is essential.
Perhaps it is inevitable that specialization precede integration in development, inevitable 
that youth be spent in a search for identity in the service of society, until in a last reach 
for wholeness we grasp that unified consciousness that has eluded us. As William Butler 
Yeats so eloquently put it, “Nothing can be sole and whole that has not been rent.” For 
wholeness cannot be fully appreciated save in contrast to the experience of fragmenta-
tion, compartmentalization, and specialization. Kurt Lewin’s observation that pulsation 
from differentiation to integration is the throb of the great engine of development is writ 
large as a universal social pattern of socialization.
Adaptive Flexibility and Integrative Development
There is considerable agreement among adult-development scholars that growth occurs 
through processes of differentiation and hierarchic integration and that the highest stages 
of development are characterized by personal integration and integrity. From the per-
spective of experiential learning theory, this goal is attained through a dialectic process 
316 
Experiential Learning
of adaptation to the world. Fulfillment, or individuation, as Jung calls it, is accomplished 
by expression of nondominant modes of dealing with the world and their higher-level 
integration with specialized functions. With integrative development comes an increas-
ing freedom from the dictates of immediate circumstance and the potential for creative 
response. This structural potential is expressed behaviorally by the individual’s adaptive 
flexibility. As Werner put it:
In general, the more differentiated and hierarchically organized the structure 
of an organism is, the more flexible its behavior. This means that if an activity 
is highly hierarchized, the organism, within a considerable range, can vary the 
activity to comply with the demands of the varying situation. [Werner, 1948, 
p. 55]
Adaptive flexibility and the mobility it provides are the primary vehicles of integrative 
development. They are the means by which people transcend the fixity of their special-
ized orientation. Fixity can be inferred from the intrinsic trend of any evolution toward 
an end stage of maximum stability. Such maximum stability, as the end stage of a devel-
opmental sequence, implies the closing of growth—the permanence, for instance, of 
specialized reaction patterns. But fixity would finally lead to rigidity of behavior if not 
counter-balanced by adaptive flexibility. As most generally conceived, adaptive flexibility 
implies “becoming” as opposed to “being.”
Assessing Adaptive Flexibility: The Adaptive Style Inventory
One consequence of integrative development for those scientists who wish to predict and 
control human behavior is a certain amount of frustration, for with integrative develop-
ment and its attendant adaptive flexibility comes increasing difficulty in the prediction of 
behavior. It is easy to predict behavior consequences in a low-level system (say, turning on 
a light switch) but far more difficult to predict behavior of higher-level systems capable 
of hierarchic integration (as with a computer). This problem is confounded when the 
attempt is made to characterize individuals as whole persons at a given stage of develop-
ment. Developmental theorists have recognized this problem and attempted to deal with 
it in a number of ways—for example, by ad hoc concepts, as in Piaget’s concept of hori-
zontal decalage (variability in cognitive structure from task to task in a given time period; 
compare Flavell, 1963, p. 23) or by simply averaging this variability and thus ignoring it.1
Another approach to these measurement problems is to use the level of adaptive flex-
ibility itself as an indicator of the level of integrative development. Thus, if people show 
 1.  This averaging of stage variability is Loevinger’s approach: “One must immediately admit that most 
samples of behavior, e.g., test protocols, contain evidence of functioning on diverse levels. . . .  
Nonetheless, the first step in bringing the concept within scientific compass is measurement. 
A  probabilistic modification of the hierarchies model both accommodates the complexities and 
 assimilates them to the requirements of measurement” (1966, p. 202).
317
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
systematic variability in their response to different environmental demands, we can 
infer a higher level of integrative development. To accomplish this assessment, however, 
requires that two conditions be met. First, a holistic system of environmental demands 
that samples the person’s actual and potential life space is required. As Scott (1966) 
has pointed out, adaptive flexibility is meaningful only if there is some situation or cir-
cumstance being adapted to. Variability alone is not necessarily adaptive flexibility; it 
must be systemic variation in response to varying environmental demands. Second, the 
dimensions of personal-response flexibility and situation demand should be defined in 
commensurate terms. Flexibility of response should be measured along a dimension so 
that situation/person matches or mismatches can be identified that are related to the 
situation responded to. The theory of experiential learning provides a framework within 
which these conditions can be met. Toward this end, a modified version of the Learning 
Style Inventory called the Adaptive Style Inventory (ASI) was created. This instrument 
profiles the transactions between persons and their environment by providing them 
with a series of situations in the form of sentence stems (for example, “When I start to 
do something new”), which they complete by choosing between two responses, each 
response representing an adaptive mode (such as, “I rely on my feelings to guide me”—
concrete experience; “I set priorities”—abstract conceptualization).
The ASI instrument is divided into four situations that the respondent must “adapt” to. 
These situations correspond to the four learning styles—divergent situations, assimila-
tive situations, convergent situations, and accommodative situations. Each situation is 
characterized by two sentence stems, each with six pairs of response choices that present 
the four adaptive-mode responses in paired comparison fashion. The ASI thus yields an 
adaptive profile for the four different learning-style environments and an average adap-
tive profile across all four situations.
Responses to the ASI can be portrayed in a way that shows one’s adaptive orientations 
as points on a two-dimensional learning space. One point represents average responses 
across all situations. It is achieved by noting scores on the abstract-concrete dimension 
(AC-CE) and scores on the active-reflective dimension (AE-RO) and plotting a point at 
the juncture of these two points on the learning grid (see Figure 8.1). The same procedure 
is followed to portray how the person responded in each of the four kinds of situations. 
Arrows are then drawn from the total score to each of the situational scores. These arrows 
indicate the direction of the person’s response to each kind of situation. The amount of 
adaptive flexibility from situation to situation is indicated by the length of the arrows.
Figure 8.1 shows two sample responses to the ASI. Respondent A has a total score near 
the center of the grid, indicating a relative balance in the person’s average adaptive style. 
The responses to each environmental press are consonant with the press in three of 
the four instances. The modal response to the diverger situations is heavily active and 
does not differ significantly from the total score on the abstract-concrete dimension. It 
could be said that this person responded to three situational presses—accommodator,

converger, assimilator—in terms consonant with those presses; that is, she responded to 
the situations by increasing emphasis on the adaptive modes “pulled for.” However, in 
diverger situations, the respondent responded primarily in an active mode, acting against 
the press of the situation.
Respondent B, on the other hand, has a total score well within the diverger quadrant, 
indicating a tendency to respond to all situations in a concrete and reflective mode. Each 
of the situational presses was responded to in terms other than conformity to the press of 
the environment (relative to the total score), except in converger situations. In diverger 
situations, this person responds to very concrete ways but also responds in slightly more 
active ways.
The response to diverger situations would be interpreted as more consonant with accom-
modator situations. (Admittedly, the response in terms of the total grid is still in the 
diverger quadrant, which makes the response still consonant with the situational press. 
However, the reference point for each person is not the theoretical center of the grid, 
but his or her own total score.) In accommodator situations, the person responds in a 
more abstract way and in a somewhat reflective way, contrary to the accommodator situ-
ational press, which demands a concrete and active response. In assimilator situations, 
respondent B responded in a reflective way, as would be demanded by the situation, but 
also responded in a concrete way, which is contrary to the assimilator situational press. 
Finally, this respondent responded to converger situations in ways appropriate to the 
converger situational press.
To assess the level of adaptive flexibility quantitatively, formulas were devised to deter-
mine how much the respondent varied his or her adaptive orientation from situation 
to situation. Five such variables were created: concrete experience adaptive flexibility 
(CEAF), reflective observation adaptive flexibility (ROAF), abstract conceptualization 
adaptive flexibility (ACAF), active experimentation adaptive flexibility (AEAF), and total 
adaptive flexibility (TAF).2 CEAF, for example, is the extent to which people vary their 
concrete experience orientation across the four situations. The total adaptive flexibility 
score (TAF) is the sum of CEAF, ROAF, ACAF, and AEAF. It should be noted that these 
scores do not take into account the direction of the person’s adaptation to a given situ-
ational demand but simply the degree of variation in adaptive modes from situation to 
situation, since adaptive flexibility is composed of both movement toward the press of a 
situation and movement in other directions.
2.  The specific formulas are reported in Kolb and Wolfe, 1981, pp. 117–118. Technical specifications for 
the ASI, including reliability and validity, are reported in the same publication, pp. 66–86. The study of 
 adaptive flexibility and integrative development was done in collaboration with my friend and  colleague, 
the late Glen Gish. In his life, he exemplified the ideals of integrative development of which we speak here.

The Relation between Adaptive Flexibility  
and Integrative Development
Armed with this ASI-based operational definition of adaptive flexibility, we can inves-
tigate the relation between adaptive flexibility and integrative development empirically. 
To do so, we studied three samples of midlife adults: a selected sample of 47 professional 
engineers and 23 professional social workers from the alumni study described in the last 
chapter, and a group of 39 midlife men and women of varying occupations who were par-
ticipants in an intensive study of midlife adult development issues (see Kolb and Wolfe, 
1981, for details). This latter group participated in an intensive series of self-assessment 
workshops over a three-year period, thus affording an in-depth assessment of their per-
sonalities and life situations.
Ego Development One widely used measure of integrative development is Loevinger’s 
Sentence Completion Instrument (Loevinger, 1976). In developing her model of the 
stages of adult ego development, Loevinger drew heavily on the work of Piaget, Kohlberg, 
and Perry, as well as the psychoanalytic school of ego psychology, most notably Erik 
Erikson. Scores on the Sentence Completion Test give an indication of a person’s level of 
ego development as defined by her hierarchy of six ego-development stages— impulsive, 
self-protective, conformist, conscientious, autonomous, and integrated. As can be seen 
from Table 8.1, these stages are related to the six levels of adaptation defined in the 
experiential learning theory of development (see Table 6.1). In addition, Loevinger sees 
adaptive flexibility as a hallmark of development in her framework:
Flexibility in the exchanges with the environment is no less an important prop-
erty for survival. Because organisms are dependent on environments and open 
to them, and because environments can change, organisms need to adjust and 
accommodate, to substitute a new response for a once successful one. . . . The 
degree of flexibility . . . may be an indication of the organism’s development. 
[Loevinger, 1976, p. 34]
For these reasons, we predicted a relationship between adaptive flexibility as measured by 
the ASI and a person’s level of ego development. As a test for this relationship, the three 
samples of midlife adults were given the ASI and the Sentence Completion Instrument, 
which was scored according to instructions in the Loevinger test manual  (Loevinger and 
Wessler, 1970). Most respondents scored in the middle range of Loevinger’s scheme. 
There were no “impulsive” (level 1) or “self-protective” (level 2) people and no “inte-
grated” (level 6) people in the sample. There was one “autonomous” person. Even with 
this restricted range of ego development, however, there was a significant positive rela-
tionship between total adaptive flexibility and ego-development level (r = .26, p < .003). 
Most of this covariation in adaptive flexibility occurred in reflective observation and 
abstract conceptualization (for instance, ego level with ROAF, r = .20, p < .02; with ACAF, 
r = .22, p < .01). To the extent that the ego-development measure is an indication of 
321
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
integrative development, we can conclude that the ASI measures of adaptive flexibility 
are also indicative of integrative development. A more detailed analysis of the data sug-
gests, however, that the Loevinger instrument is perhaps more attuned to development 
of adaptive flexibility in the reflective and abstract adaptive modes than in the concrete 
and active orientation.
Self-direction Perhaps a more active indicator of integrative development is people’s 
ability to direct their own lives, to be an “origin” rather than a “pawn” (deCharms, 1968) 
in their life activities. The self-assessment workshops conducted for the group of midlife 
adults allowed researchers to rate participants on how self-directed they were in their 
current life situations (see Crary, 1981, for details). The criterion used for these ratings 
was the extent to which a person’s set of life contexts determined that person’s behavior 
as opposed to the behavior’s being controlled by the person.
The relationship between total adaptive flexibility and the person’s degree of self- 
directedness was significantly positive (r = .26, p < .05) and, as might be predicted, deter-
mined primarily by adaptive flexibility in active experimentation (self-directedness with 
AEAF, r = .28, p < .05). This suggests that those at higher levels of integrative develop-
ment as measured by the ASI are more self-directed and display that self-directedness 
through choiceful variation of their active behavior in different situations.
Cognitive Complexity in Relationships The experiential learning theory of develop-
ment describes affective development in concrete experience as a process of increasing 
complexity in one’s conception of personal relationships (see Table 6.1), resulting from 
integration of the four learning modes. Thus we would predict that increasing adaptive 
flexibility, particularly in the realm of concrete experience, would be associated with 
increased richness in construing one’s interpersonal world. A major component of inter-
nal structural complexity is the constructions, as expressed in the words one uses, which 
can be called upon to describe and manipulate one’s thoughts and interactions with 
the interpersonal environment. This notion was operationalized in the context of the 
self-assessment workshops. In the workshops, the midlife adults engaged in a number 
of exercises in which they portrayed the configuration of their life structures graphically 
and by analogy. During these exercises, the facilitating researchers noted the words each 
respondent used to describe his or her life structures. A list of each person’s words was 
later presented to the respondent for verification as the person’s own terminology. Each 
respondent had the opportunity to eliminate or add words in order to make the list truly 
representative of his or her set of constructs. The final list of constructs became the vari-
able we are using here called “number of constructs.”
As predicted, total adaptive flexibility was positively correlated with the total number of 
constructs a person used to describe his or her interpersonal world (r = .25; p < .06). This 
relationship was most significantly evidenced in the area of concrete experience (CEAF 
with number of constructs, r = .28, p < .04).

Experiential Learning
Taken together, the results above suggest that overall adaptive flexibility and adaptive 
flexibility in the four adaptive modes are meaningful indicators of integrative develop-
ment. Total adaptive flexibility as measured by the ASI is significantly related to the 
level of ego development, to self-direction, and to the complexity of one’s interpersonal 
constructs. Ego development, at least as it is measured in the Loevinger model, is most 
strongly associated with adaptive flexibility in reflection and conceptualization, reflect-
ing the development and manipulation of internalized hierarchical structures for con-
struing the world that characterizes higher levels of cognitive and ego development. 
Increased self-direction is more associated with flexibility in behavioral actions, and 
richness in one’s constructs about the interpersonal world is associated most strongly 
with flexibility in concrete experiencing. These results, although limited to one sample, 
are promising, for they offer a measure of integrative development via the ASI that is 
sensitive both to development as a unitary process and to specialized development in 
different adaptive modes.
The Integrated Life Style
What can be said of the nature of the integrated life? How do people cope with the inte-
grative challenges of adult life, and what can we learn from their example? Further results 
from our ASI study of adaptive flexibility, along with the case-by-case examination of the 
individual lives in our study of midlife adults, suggest some important characteristics of 
the integrated lifestyle.
Proactive Adaptation First, integrated people both adapt to and create their life struc-
tures. Their relationship with the world and others around them is transactional, in that 
they are proactive in the creation of their life tasks and situations and are shaped and 
molded by these situations as well. Paulo Freire describes this integrative stance toward 
one’s life context as follows:
Integration with one’s context, as distinguished from adaptation, is a distinctively 
human activity. Integration results from the capacity to adapt oneself to reality 
plus the critical capacity to make choices and to transform that reality. To the 
extent that man loses his ability to make choices and is subjected to the choices of 
others, to the extent that his decisions are no longer his own because they result 
from external prescriptions, he is no longer integrated. Rather, he has adapted. 
He has “adjusted.” Unpliant men, with a revolutionary spirit, are often termed 
“maladjusted.”
The integrated person is person as subject. In contrast, the adaptive person is 
person as object, adaptation representing at most a weak form of self-defense. 
If man is incapable of changing reality, he adjusts himself instead. Adaptation is 
behavior characteristic of the animal sphere; exhibited by man, it is symptomatic 
of his dehumanization. Throughout history men have attempted to overcome 
325
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
the factors which make them accommodate or adjust, in a struggle—constantly 
threatened by oppression—to attain their full humanity.
As men related to the world by responding to the challenges of the environment, 
they began to dynamize, to master, and to humanize reality. They add to it some-
thing of their own making, by giving temporal meaning to geographic space, by 
creating culture. This interplay of men’s relations with the world and with their 
fellows does not (except in cases of repressive power) permit societal or cultural 
immobility. As men create, re-create, and decide, historical epochs begin to take 
shape. And it is by creating, re-creating, and deciding that men should participate 
in these epochs. [Freire, 1973, pp. 3–4]
We found tantalizing suggestions of this proactive stance among integrated people when 
we examined the ASI adaptive flexibility scores of low- and high-ego-development peo-
ple in our samples of adult professionals and midlife persons. Low-ego-development 
people, as we have already seen, showed less flexibility and variation from situation to 
situation. In addition, a case-by-case examination suggests that most of this variation 
was toward the press of the situation, such as becoming more active and concrete in 
accommodative situations or more abstract and reflective in assimilative situations. 
This pattern is suggestive of adjustment, or what Freire calls adaptation. High-ego-
development people, on the other hand, showed greater variation, and much of this 
variation was counter to the press of the situation, such as responding reflectively in 
active situations or concretely in abstract situations. Here it appears that integrated 
people respond more creatively to situations supplying perspectives that from a holistic-
learning point of view are missing. Thus, high-ego-development persons may respond 
to the abstract task of understanding the basic principles of something by seeking and 
exploring concrete examples, or they may deal with an active task such as completing a 
task on time by reflectively creating a plan.
This integrated response produces a creative tension between the person and his or 
her life situations, a tension that may in fact be essential for the creative response that 
 integrative development engenders. Howard Gruber describes the importance of being 
one’s own person in the creative process:
This obligation to move back and forth between radically different perspec-
tives produces a deep tension in every creative life. In the course of ordinary 
development similar tensions begin to appear. What we mean by such terms as 
 adaptation and adjustment is the resolution of these tensions. But that is not the 
path of the creative person. He or she must safeguard the distance and the spe-
cialness, live with the tension. [Feldman, 1980, p. 180]
Rich Life Structures A second characteristic of the integrated life style is seen in the life 
structures of integrated people. The life structures of integrated persons mirror the integrative  
326 
Experiential Learning
complexity of their personalities. It was Kurt Lewin (1951) who first noted the isomor-
phism between the person’s development level and the level of complexity of his or her life 
space. When we examine the life structures of those who score high on the ASI measures 
of adaptive flexibility, we see complex, flexible, and highly differentiated life structures. 
These people experience their lives in ways that bring variety and richness to them and the 
environment. They engage with their environments by flexibly moving within those envi-
ronments, by creating highly differentiated life spaces and relationships, and by building 
networks of relationships and contexts. Marcy Crary has defined these dimensions thus:
Some people lead lives with a great deal of freedom of movement and variation 
in involvement within their different contexts. Either through their own person 
and/or the nature of the contexts they engage within, there is an appearance of 
a great deal of flexibility in their life structures. The contrasting lifestyle is one 
in which there is much routine, pre-arranged structuring of day-to-day events, 
likely leading to much repetition of events, activities, relationships within each of 
the person’s contexts. Low rating on this scale would likely imply a higher degree 
of role-bounded situations and involvements. A high rating implies a relatively 
greater amount of “spontaneous” living. [Crary, 1979, p. 20]
A related dimension is that of differentiation within a person’s life space. Crary states:
This dimension relates to the degree of heterogeneity of contexts within a per-
son’s life-space. A life-space which is differentiated is multifaceted, containing a 
variety of components or regions within its boundaries. . . . Applied to the life-
space as a whole (within and across contexts) the low end of the scale denotes a 
life space in which not one of the contexts seem to stand apart from the others in 
terms of the person’s experience of them. The high rating refers to a life style in 
which the person clearly experiences variation and contrasts within and across 
their different contexts. [Crary, 1979, p. 10]
When Crary’s ratings on these dimensions of life structure were correlated with 
 adaptive-flexibility scores, significant relationships emerged. Flexible life structures were 
significantly associated with the integrated adaptively flexible people (TAF with flexibil-
ity in life structure, r = .36, p < .01; for AEAF, r = .41, p < .005; for ACAF, r = .37, p < .01; 
N.S. for ROAF and CEAF). Differentiation in life structure was also associated with 
adaptive flexibility (TAF with differentiation in life structure, r = .35, p < .01; for AEAF, 
r = .34, p < .02; for ACAF, r = .40, p < .005; for ROAF, r = .30, p < .03; N.S. for CEAF). The 
integrated person seems capable of constructing a rich, complex, and flexible life space 
that sustains him or her and provides new opportunities for growth.
Conflict A key to the ability to manage complexity lies in a final characteristic of the 
integrated lifestyle identified in our research—harmony, the constructive management 
of conflict. We found in our sample of midlife adults no significant difference overall 
327
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
between high-adaptive-flexibility and low-adaptive-flexibility people in the amount of 
stress and change they had to cope with in their lives. Yet when we measured the amount 
of conflict these people experienced in their lives, the adaptively flexible, integrated 
persons experienced much less conflict than those with low adaptive flexibility. A panel 
of researchers evaluated each respondent on a number of dimensions, including the 
degree of conflict. Conflict was defined as the extent of “incompatibilities, force and 
counter-force” (Crary, 1979) a person experiences among the various settings in his or 
her life, without regard to the number or complexity of the relationships among these 
settings. This rating was based on various exercises that respondents completed in the 
self-assessment workshops. These exercises served to portray the respondents’ life space, 
their relationships with others, and a longitudinal view of their past and possible future.
When this rating was correlated with ASI adaptive-flexibility scores, high adaptive flex-
ibility was associated with low conflict. (TAF with degree of conflict, r = −.34, p < .02; for 
AEAF, r = −.30, p < .03; for ACAF, r = −.24, p < .06; for CEAF, r = −.27, p < .05; N.S. for 
ROAF.) Further analysis, controlling for the amount of conflict in each individual life 
structure, showed that adaptively flexible people experienced the least stress in their lives 
in spite of the fact that their life structures, as we have seen, are the most complex. This 
harmony in life structure occurred in the context of the more balanced life structure that 
characterized most of those in our midlife sample (Kolb and Wolfe, 1981). Early in their 
lives, people have life structures that are heavily oriented around work (mainly for men) 
or family (for women). At midlife comes more balance in life investment, a balance that 
may be the foundation for the harmony and lower conflict in the lives of integrated people.
On Integrity and Integrative Knowledge
The pinnacle of development is integrity. It is that highest level of human functioning 
that we strive consciously and even unconsciously, perhaps automatically, to reach. The 
motivation to achieve integrity is a profound gift of humanity—a desire to reach out, 
understand, become, and grow, a pervasive motivation for mastery that Robert White has 
called motivation for competence. The Random House Dictionary of the English  Language 
(Stein, 1966) offers three definitions of integrity: “1. soundness of and adherence to moral 
principle and character . . . ; 2. the state of being whole, entire, or undiminished . . . ; 3. 
sound, unimpaired, or perfect condition” (p. 738). All these usages of the term are essen-
tial to define the concept as it is used here, but Warren Bennis’s definition of integrity is 
perhaps more instructive of its meaning for the theory of experiential learning:
Integrity. Integration. The integral personality. Such permutations are permis-
sible plays on the word, which shares roots with integer, the untouchable (in and 
tanger) whole number which links the most abstract of endeavors, mathematics, 
to the human condition. I am talking about the kind of unity—of purpose, goals, 
ideas, and communication—that makes three musketeers, Three Musketeers.  
328 
Experiential Learning
It’s a merging of identities and resolves into a coherent and effective whole. [Ben-
nis, 1981–82, p. 4]
In the theory of experiential learning, integrity is a sophisticated, integrated process of 
learning, of knowing. It is not primarily a set of character traits such as honesty, consis-
tency, or morality. These traits are only probable behavioral derivations of the integrated 
judgments that flow from integrated learning. Honesty, consistency, and morality are 
usually, but not always, the result of integrated learning. One need only reflect on the 
“immoral” behavior of men like Copernicus and Galileo to realize that integrity is the 
learning process by which intellectual, moral, and ethical standards are created, not some 
evaluation based on current moral standards and worldviews.
It is misleading to confuse these products of integrity, absolute and reasonable as they 
appear, with the process that creates them, for creators precede their creations in time 
and must create with no fixed absolutes to guide them. Integrity as a way of know-
ing embraces the future and the unknown as well as the codified conventions of social 
knowledge that are, by their nature, historical record. The prime function of integrity 
and integrative knowledge is to stand at the interface between social knowledge and 
the ever-novel predicaments and dilemmas we find ourselves in; its goal is to guide us 
through these straits in such a way that we not only survive, but perhaps can make some 
new contribution to the data bank of social knowledge for generations to come.
The knowledge structure of integrity does not comform to any one of the four knowledge 
structures identified in Chapter 5; it is usually some integrative synthesis of these in the 
emergent historical moment. As such, integrative knowing is essentially eclectic, if by the 
term is meant, “not consistent with current forms.” It stands with one foot on the shore 
of the conventions of social knowledge and one foot in the canoe of an emergent future—
a most uncomfortable and taxing position, one that positively demands commitment to 
either forging ahead or jumping back to safety. Stephen Pepper proposes the following 
guidelines for a reasonable eclecticism:
In practice, therefore, we shall want to be not rational but reasonable, and to seek, 
on the matter in question, the judgment supplied from each of these relatively 
adequate world theories. If there is some difference of judgment, we shall wish 
to make our decision with all these modes of evidence in mind, just as we should 
make any other decision where the evidence is conflicting. In this way we should 
be judging in the most reasonable way possible—not dogmatically following only 
one line of evidence, not perversely ignoring evidence, but sensibly acting on all 
the evidence available. [Pepper, 1942, pp. 330–331]
Thus, in integrative learning, knowledge is refined by viewing predicaments through 
the dialectically opposed lenses of the four basic knowledge structures and then “acting 
sensibly.”
329
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
The way in which this process is carried out is in many ways the topic of Pepper’s last 
book, Concept and Quality. Here, Pepper proposes a fifth world hypothesis for integra-
tive learning—selectivism—with the root metaphor purposive act. For it is in a single 
act of purpose that the psychological world of feeling, thought, and desire (“I want that 
goal”) and the physical world (myself and the world as physical/chemical substances) 
are integrated, that value and fact, quality and concept, are fused. It is here that goal 
meets reality, “ought” meets “is.” Selectivism as a world hypothesis turns out to be very 
much like contextualism or modern-day pragmatism in its emphasis on novelty and 
uncertainty as the basic adaptive problem facing the human species. The basic paradigm 
of selectivism is one where, seeking goals as judgments of value, we pursue realities 
based on judgments of fact. Reality in this paradigm is “what pushes back,” to use E. A. 
Singer’s (1959) apt phrase. Reality allows our conceptions of it, it does not cause them. 
Von  Glasersfeld describes the selectivist paradigm thus:
Roughly speaking, concepts, theories, and cognitive structures in general are 
viable and survive as long as they serve the purposes to which we put them. . . .
If we accept this concept of viability, it becomes clear that it would be absurd to 
maintain that our knowledge is in any sense a replica or picture of reality. . . . [W]
hile we can know when a theory or model knocks against the constraints of our 
experiential world, the fact that it does not knock against them but “gets by” and 
is still viable, does in no way justify the belief that the theory or model therefore 
depicts a “real” world. . . .
[W]e must never say that our knowledge is “pure” in the sense that it reflects an 
ontologically real world. Knowledge neither should nor could have such a func-
tion. The fact that some construct has for some time survived experience—or 
experiments for that matter—means that up to that point it was viable in that 
it bypassed the constraints that are inherent in the range of experience within 
which we were operating. But viability does not imply uniqueness, because there 
may be innumerable other constructs that would have been as viable as the one 
we created. [von Glasersfeld, 1977, pp. 7–14]
An important implication of this constructionist view of reality is that theories are always 
combinations of value and fact, since it is value judgments that determine which aspects 
of reality are selected to be explored and how that exploration will take place. As a result, 
a primary dialectic that must be resolved in integrative knowledge is that of value and 
fact. Integrity requires the thoughtful articulation of value judgments as well as the scien-
tific judgment of fact. The essential character of this dialectic integration is one of valuing 
via apprehension and creating facts via comprehension. The sense in which civilization 
is a race between such integrated learning and chaos is captured beautifully in Hegel’s 
image of the owl of Minerva, the symbol of wisdom, beginning its flight just as darkness 
threatens.
330 
Experiential Learning
To say one more word about preaching what the world ought to be like, philoso-
phy always arrives too late for that. As thought of the world it appears at a time 
when actuality has completed its developmental process and is finished. What 
the conception teaches history also shows as necessary, namely, that only in a 
maturing actuality the ideal appears and confronts the real. It is then that the ideal 
rebuilds for itself this same world in the shape of an intellectual realm, compre-
hending this world in its substance. When philosophy paints its gray in gray, a 
form of life has become old, and this gray in gray cannot rejuvenate it, only under-
stand it. The owl of Minerva begins its flight when dusk is falling. [Hegel, 1820]
Integrity requires that we learn to speak unselfconsciously about values in matters of fact. 
We need to develop, in the arena of values, inquiry methods that are as sophisticated and 
powerful as the methods of science have been in matters of fact.
No less significant for the attainment of integrative knowledge is the resolution of the 
dialectic between relevance and meaning. Western industrial societies have nearly run 
amok in their embrace of the extroverted materialism of relevance, ignoring and even 
actively denying the meaning of religious, humanistic, and spiritual ideals. Cast adrift 
from any meaningful connection with relevant work in the material world, internal lives 
can become wastelands of existential angst or sensual hedonism. The challenge of inte-
grative knowledge, here, is to reimbue the pragmatic short-term choices and judgments 
that have given us polluted air and water, the threat of instant nuclear annihilation, the 
creation of a permanent underclass, and other such harmful side effects of our particular 
form of technological civilization, with the long-range perspective of meaning that arises 
from reflection on the human condition and the history of civilization. What we need 
is a theory of intentional action to guide us through these choices, to lay bare the plan 
whereby humanity has made these judgments in the past, and to suggest new “rules” for 
current circumstances.
In resolving the dialectic conflicts between value and fact, meaning and relevance, integ-
rity is the master virtue. In a way that is similar to the identification of learning styles 
we can see in typical resolutions of these two dialectics, more specialized virtues (see 
Figure 8.2) whose primary function is to preserve and protect one pole of each dialectic: 
wisdom, the protector of fact and meaning; justice, the protector of fact and relevance; 
courage, the protector of relevance and value; and love, the protector of value and mean-
ing. These specialized virtues are counterpress behavioral injunctions: they instruct us 
to act against the demand characteristic of life situations, to create, not adjust. Wisdom 
dictates that we do not blindly follow the implications of knowledge but that we be 
choicefully responsible in the use of knowledge. Courage tells us to push forward when 
circumstance signals danger and retreat. Love requires that we hold our selfish acts in 
check until we have viewed the situation from the perspective of the other—the Golden 
Rule. And justice demands fair and equitable treatment for all against the expedience of 
the special situation.
331
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
The late Niels Bohr once remarked that his interest in complementarity in physics had 
been stimulated by the thought that one cannot know another human being at the same 
time in the light of love and in the light of justice. Thus, the specialized virtues have a 
bias in favor of the dialectic poles they protect. It remains for integrity and integrated 
knowing to rise above these biases for the truly integrated judgment.
The Experience of Integrity—The Mandala Symbol
The experience of integrity and the characteristics of integrated knowing can be illus-
trated by the structure of the symbol that has represented them throughout the history 
of humanity. The mandala symbol is the most important symbol in the Jungian panoply 
of the symbols and archetypes that populate the human psyche. This symbol of whole-
ness, unity, and integrity is to be found in most of the world’s religions—the Christian 
cross, the star of David, and the intertwined fishes of yin and yang. Its value as a tool for 
meditation is renowned, producing a timeless centering of consciousness in which “you

unify the world, you are the world itself, and you are unified by the world.” Jung (1931) 
collected examples of the mandala symbol from paleolithic to modern times, from East-
ern religions to Western art and literature. He saw in these symbols the characteristics of 
individuation, of integrity.
Mandala means a circle, especially a magic circle, signifying the integrity of experience, 
an eternal process where endings become beginnings again and again. “The mandala 
form is that of a flower, cross or wheel with a distinct tendency towards quadripartite 
structures” (Jung, 1931, p. 100). The typical four-part structure of the mandala often 
 represents dual polarities, as in the Tibetian Buddhist Tantric mandala shown here 
 (Figure 8.3). Here, double dorjes (dorje = “thunderbolt” of knowledge that cuts through 
confusion with penetrating wisdom) form a cross representing the interconnection of 
the earth realm (matter) and the realm of heaven (spirit).
It is the integration of these polarities that fuels the endless circular process of know-
ing. “Psychologically this circulation would be the ‘turning in a circle around oneself’; 
whereby, obviously, all sides of the personality become involved. They cause the poles of 
light and darkness to rotate. . . .” (1931, p. 104).
The product of this dialectic circulation process is a centering of one’s experience. “The 
mandala symbol is not only a means of expression but works an effect. It reacts upon 
Figure 8.3 
Tibetan Buddhist Tantric Symbol
333
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
its maker. . . . [By meditating on it] the attention or, better said, the interest, is brought 
back to an inner sacred domain, which is the source and goal of the soul. . . .” [1931, pp. 
102–103]. Warren Bennis, in his recent study of effective leaders in all walks of life, has 
noted that this “centeredness” is a common trait among many of them (1980, p. 20). 
With centering comes the experience of transcendence, the conscious experience of 
hierarchic integration where what was before our whole world is transformed into but 
one of a multidimensional array of worlds to experience. In interviewing the associates 
of people who are perceived to “have integrity,” I have been struck by the awe in which 
their integrative judgments are held; judgments that, like Solomon’s decision to cut the 
baby in half, appear to rise above the confines of justice to include love; judgments that 
are seen as not only wise but courageous. The capacity for such integrated judgment 
seems to be borne out of transcendence, wherein the conflicts that those of us at lower 
levels of insight perceive as win-lose are recast into a higher form that can make every-
one a winner, or can make winning and losing irrelevant. And finally, with centering 
comes commitment in the integration of abstract ideals in the concrete here-and-now 
of one’s life. When we act from our center, the place of truth within us, action is based 
on the fusion of value and fact, meaning and relevance, and hence is totally committed. 
Only by personal commitment to the here-and-now of one’s life situation, fully accept-
ing one’s past and taking choiceful responsibility for one’s future, is the dialectic conflict 
necessary for learning experienced. The dawn of integrity comes with the acceptance of 
responsibility for the course of one’s own life. For in taking responsibility for the world, 
we are given back the power to change it.
Update and Reflections
Lifelong Learning and the Learning Way
“For he had learned some of the things that everyman must find out for 
himself, and he had found out about them as one has to find out, through 
errors and through trial, through fantasy and delusion, through  falsehood 
and his own damn foolishness, through being mistaken and wrong and 
an idiot and egotistical and aspiring and hopeful and  believing and 
confused. As he lay there he had gone back over his life, and bit by bit, 
had extracted from it some of the hard lessons of experience. Each thing 
he learned was so simple and so obvious once he grasped it, that he 
wondered why he had not always known it. . . . Altogether, they wove 
into a kind of leading thread, trailing backward through his past and out 
into the future. And he thought now, perhaps he could begin to shape his 
334 
Experiential Learning
life to mastery, for he felt a sense of new direction deep within him, but 
whither it would take him he could not say.”
—Thomas Wolfe, You Can’t Go Home Again
When I was doing the research for Experiential Learning, I was aided immensely by our 
Organization Behavior Department’s project on Lifelong Learning and Development 
funded by two large grants from the Spencer Foundation (Wolfe and Kolb, 1980) and 
the National Institute for Education (Kolb and Wolfe, 1981) aimed at increasing under-
standing of two topics that sparked a lot of national attention at the time: lifelong learn-
ing and adult development. Since then “lifelong learning” has steadily moved from an 
inspiring aspiration to a necessary reality. The transformative global, social, economic, 
and technological conditions that were envisioned over forty years ago have come to 
fruition in a way that requires a fundamental rethinking of the relationship between 
learning and education. From a front-loaded, system-driven educational structure 
dominated by classroom learning, we are in the process of transitioning to a new reality 
where individual learners are becoming more responsible for the direction of their own 
learning in a multitude of learning environments that span their lifetime. This transi-
tion parallels other self-direction requirements that have been placed on individuals by 
the emergence of the global economy such as responsibility for one’s own retirement 
planning and health care. Aspin and Chapman (2000) in their review of these develop-
ments identify what they call the triadic nature of lifelong learning encompassing three 
areas with different learning needs—learning for economic progress and development, 
learning for personal development and fulfilment, and learning for the development of a 
just and thriving democracy. The challenge of lifelong learning is not just about learning 
new marketable skills in an ever-changing economy. It is about the whole person and 
their personal development in their many roles as family member, citizen, and worker.
The solution is not a world of self-taught autodidacts. Social institutions, government 
policy makers, and educators face fundamental changes to support lifelong learners. 
While the individual is primarily responsible for his or her learning, it must happen 
in an interdependent relationship with others. Hinchcliffe, in his critical rethinking of 
lifelong learning, describes the situation thusly, “For in embracing the concept of life-
long learning one also embraces a whole pedagogy: one cannot have a lifelong learner 
without bringing in the associated features of the reflective learner, teaching through 
facilitation, the emphasis on the transferability of learning and the importance of self-
direction and self-management. One cannot be a lifelong learner unless one absorbs a 
whole discourse of pedagogy. . . a person has to live a whole ideology so that one must 
‘acquire the self-image of a lifelong learner’” (2006, p. 97). In his rethinking, he empha-
sizes the organic learner who is an interdependent actor, a becoming self immersed in 
the contextual world of practices. He emphasizes “the activity-based nature of learning 
which is experiential, collaborative, and often activated by individual learners rather 
335
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
than trainers or teachers” (2006, p. 99). Su adds the importance of a “being” versus 
“having” approach to lifelong learning: “The ability that a lifelong learner is expected 
to demonstrate changes from a focus on how much ‘static’ knowledge one has to the 
development of a dynamic ability to make sense of knowledge in order to be within 
change. This dynamic ability, which insists on human agency, and thereby on the pos-
sibility of flexibility, serves as the foundation for the transformation and development 
of adult learners into lifelong learners” (Su, 2011, p. 58). Peter Vaill in Learning as a 
Way of Being (1996) makes a similar point stressing the importance of approaching 
the turbulent change of an emerging world of “permanent white water” with a begin-
ner’s mind.
The Learning Way
Experiential learning theory provides a framework for such a program for the lifelong 
learner; helping learners understand and adapt to these new circumstances through 
deliberate experiential learning (Passarelli and Kolb, 2011). Learning can have magi-
cal transformative powers. It opens new doors and pathways, expanding our world 
and capabilities. It literally can change who we are by creating new professional and 
personal identities. Learning is intrinsically rewarding and empowering, bringing new 
avenues of experience and new realms of mastery. In a very real sense, you are what 
you learn.
The learning way is about approaching life experiences with a learning attitude. It 
involves a deep trust in one’s own experience and a healthy skepticism about received 
knowledge. It requires the perspective of quiet reflection and a passionate commitment 
to action in the face of uncertainty. The learning way is not the easiest way to approach 
life, but in the long run, it is the wisest. Other ways of living tempt us with immediate 
gratification at our peril. The way of dogma, the way of denial, the way of addiction, the 
way of submission, and the way of habit; all offer relief from uncertainty and pain at the 
cost of entrapment on a path that winds out of our control. The learning way requires 
deliberate effort to create new knowledge in the face of uncertainty and failure, but opens 
the way to new, broader, and deeper horizons of experience.
The Learning Way Is a Way of Experiencing It is a way of being present with the 
world in the way it is, a way of becoming through being. Opening oneself to experience 
is necessary for learning and renewal. James March described experience as ambiguous, 
while William James saw pure experience as having infinite depth, mysterious and even 
spiritual. The first three quarters of the learning cycle from experiencing to acting all 
happens in our heads. The last quarter, from after we act to the ensuing experiences, 
happens in what we naively call “the real world.” Here there is novelty, uncertainty, pain 
and joy, unexpected consequences, and wonderful surprises. D. H. Lawrence describes 
it as “Terra Incognita”:
336 
Experiential Learning
There are vast realms of consciousness still undreamed of
vast ranges of experience, like the humming of unseen harps,
we know nothing of, within us.
Oh when man escaped from the barbed wire entanglement
of his own ideas and his own mechanical devices
there is a marvellous rich world of contact and sheer fluid beauty
and fearless face-to-face awareness of now-naked life
and me, and you, and other men and women
and grapes, and ghouls, and ghosts and green moonlight
and ruddy-orange limbs stirring the limbo
of the unknown air, and eyes so soft
softer than the space between the stars.
And all things, and nothing, and being and not-being
alternately palpitant,
when at last we escape the barbed-wire enclosure
of Know Thyself, knowing we can never know,
we can but touch, and wonder, and ponder, and make our effort
and dangle in a last fastidious fine delight
as the fuchsia does, dangling her reckless drop
of purpose after so much putting forth
and slow mounting marvel of a little tree. (Lawrence, 1920, p. 1)
Ideally we would live each successive life experience fully—present and aware in the 
moment, taking it in fully. Yet, many of us live our daily lives making little or no con-
scious effort to learn from our experiences. While research in many areas has shown that 
experience alone does not produce much learning, many tend to assume that effective 
learning happens automatically and give little thought to how they learn or how they 
might improve their learning capability. Research on automaticity described earlier sug-
gests that many of the activities of our daily lives are conducted on “automatic pilot” 
without conscious awareness and intention (Bargh and Chartrand, 1999). When I first 
read about the Theraveda Buddhism concept of moment experiencing as a string of 
pearls and Kahneman’s (Kahneman and Riis, 2005) estimate that we have 20,000 such 
moments every day, accumulating a half billion moments in 70 years, my spontaneous 
reaction was, “Wow, I have sure missed a lot in my life!” (Chapter 4 Update and Reflec-
tions, pp. 138–139)
The Learning Way Is the Way of Self-Creation Looking back, your life can be seen as 
a succession of these experiences, some of which you created for yourself and some that 
were thrust upon you. These life events are strung together like beads on a string defining 
that remarkable continuity that determines who you are. Looking forward to the future, 
the beads are only dreams and distant visions of future experiences. Your experience in 
this present moment is all that actually exists. In it you are fashioning a bead of mean-
337
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
ing for the past and choosing the next experience ahead. The next experience offers new 
potentialities for meaning and choice, and so on in a lifelong process of self-creation and 
learning. As Oprah Winfrey has said, “With every experience, you alone are painting 
your own canvas, thought by thought, choice by choice.”
The learning way is about awakening the learning life force that lies within all 
of us. It is a power that we share with all living things, autopoeisis, the power of 
self-making. To open oneself and receive this life energy conveys magical powers 
of self-transformation. Learning from conscious experience is the highest form of the 
learning life force. Every human invention and achievement is the result of this pro-
cess. In some spiritual  traditions we humans are thought to be basically “asleep”; going 
through this process in a semi-conscious way, strangely disengaged from our own lives. 
The learning way is about awakening to attend consciously to our experience and delib-
erately choose how it influences our beliefs and how we will live our lives. The spiral of 
learning from experience is the process through which we consciously choose, direct, 
and control life experiences. By placing conscious experience at the center of the learning 
process we can literally create ourselves through learning.
The Learning Way Is a Way of Humility In the face of the infinite depth and breadth 
of experience one cannot help but be humbled by our limited partaking of it, drinking 
from the ocean of experience teacup by teacup, recognizing that our previous concep-
tions must always be tested by new emerging realities and a desire to learn. Humility 
is characterized by open-mindedness, a willingness to make mistakes and seek advice 
(Tangney, 2000). The humble way eschews self-preoccupation and is a process of becom-
ing “unselved” (Templeton, 1997); recognizing our place as one of our 6 billion fellow 
humans on this small planet in the wider universe.
The Learning Way Is a Moral Way This last chapter of Experiential Learning describes 
integration and integrity as the culmination of the lifelong process of learning from expe-
rience, uniting the virtues of love, justice, courage, and wisdom. Critics have described 
experiential learning as a self-centered liberal humanism unconcerned about others: 
“Underneath the avowal that community is indispensable is a longing for a unitary, 
authentic self, untouched by the demands of human mutuality. . . . Experiential learning 
encourages psychic growth by freeing us from the oppression of other people’s choices” 
(Michelson, 1999, p. 140). Yet empathy, the deep experiencing of others, must be the 
motivational source of the emotional compassion that drives the imperative to act mor-
ally with others. I have already described (Chapter 6 Update and Reflections) Rogers’ 
theory that morality emerges from the deep experiencing of the human being. It is an 
inside-out process rather than the outside-in prescription from the imposition of an 
external moral system or dogma. The experiential learning theory way suggests that 
abstract moral principles must be integrated into the experience and context of the per-
son in order to guide moral action.

Experiential Learning
Deliberate Experiential Learning
This process of experiencing with awareness to create meaning and make choices is 
what we call deliberate experiential learning. Deliberate learning requires mastery of 
experiential learning, or more particularly, it requires a personal understanding of 
one’s unique way of learning from experience and the ability to intentionally direct 
and control one’s learning. In short, one needs to be in charge of their learning to be 
in charge of their life. We have identified five metacognitive practices that can awaken 
and enhance the power of learning that lies within (Kolb and Kolb, 2009; Passarelli and 
Kolb, 2011; Kolb and Yeganeh, 2015). The five areas of metacognitive regulation are: 
learning identity, learning spaces, learning relationships, mindful experiencing, and 
deliberate practice (see Figure 8.4).
Metacognition—The Key to Deliberate Learning
Deliberate experiential learning requires individual conscious metacognitive control of 
the learning process that enables monitoring and selecting learning approaches that work 
best in different learning situations. James Zull described metacognition as the culmina-
tion of the journey from brain to mind—the mind’s ability to reflect on itself and control 
its own process. “In many ways, a learner’s awareness and insight about development of 
her own mind is the ultimate and most powerful objective of education; not just thinking, 
but thinking about thinking. It is when our mind begins to comprehend itself that we can 
say we are making progress. This ability may be the highest and most complex mental

capability of the human brain. It is the thread that weaves back and forth through the 
cloth of the mind. . . . Gaining a metacognitive state of mind offers greater possibilities 
for experiencing the joy of learning than, perhaps, any of the other objectives or goals 
discussed so far” (2011, Chapter 10).
The concept of metacognition originated in the work of William James in his examina-
tion of the role of attention in experience and his ideomotor theory of action described in 
his two-volume magnum opus, The Principles of Psychology (1890). For James,  attention 
plays its focus “like a spotlight” across the field of consciousness in a way that is some-
times involuntary, as when a bright light or loud noise “captures” our attention, but 
often voluntary. Voluntary attention is determined by one’s interest in the object of 
attention. He defines a spiral of interest-attention-selection that creates a continuous 
ongoing flow of experience summarized in the pithy statement—“My experience is what 
I agree to attend to” (1890, p. 403). He defines interest as an “intelligible perspective” 
that directs attention and ultimately selection of some experiences over others. Selec-
tion feeds back to refine and integrate a person’s intelligible perspective, serving as “the 
very keel on which our mental ship is built” (James cited in Leary 1992, p. 157). In his 
chapter on will, James developed a theory of intentional action which is essential for any 
metacognitive knowledge to be useful in improving one’s learning ability. His ideomotor 
action theory states that an idea firmly focused in consciousness will automatically issue 
forth into behavior—“Every representation of a movement awakens in some degree the 
actual movement which is the object; and awakens it in a maximum degree whenever it 
is not kept from so doing by an antagonistic representation present simultaneously to 
the mind” (James, 1890, p. 526).
Flavell (1979) re-introduced the concept of metacognition in contemporary psychology, 
dividing metacognitive knowledge into three sub-categories: (1) knowledge of person 
variables referring to general knowledge about how human beings learn and process 
information, as well as individual knowledge of one’s own learning processes; (2) task 
variables including knowledge about the nature of the task and what it will require of the 
individual; (3) knowledge about strategy variables including knowledge about ways to 
improve learning as well as conditional knowledge about when and where it is appropri-
ate to use such strategies. Until recently, research on metacognitive learning has explored 
the influence of only relatively simple models of learning. For example, a study of fifth 
grader self-paced learning of stories found that the best students spent more time study-
ing difficult versus easy stories, while there was no difference in study times for the 
poorer students. The findings suggest that the poorer students lacked a metacognitive 
model that dictated a strategy of spending more time on difficult learning tasks (Owings, 
Peterson, Bransford, Morris, and Stein, 1980).
More recently Nelson (1996) and his colleagues have developed a model that emphasizes 
processes of monitoring and control in metacognition. An individual monitors their 
learning process at the experience level and relates the observations to a model of their 
340 
Experiential Learning
learning process at the meta-level. The results of the conscious introspection are used 
to control actual learning at the experience level. We (Kolb and Kolb, 2009) have sug-
gested a modification of Nelson’s metacognitive model based on experiential learning 
theory that can help learners gain a better understanding of the learning process, them-
selves as learners, and the appropriate use of learning strategies based on the learning 
task and environment (see Figure 8.5). Here an individual is engaged in the process of 
learning something at the level of direct concrete experience. His reflective monitoring 
of the learning process he is going through is compared at the abstract meta-level with 
his  idealized experiential learning model that includes concepts such as: whether he is 
spiraling through each stage of the learning cycle, the way his unique learning style fits 
with how he is being taught, and the learning demands of what he is learning. This com-
parison results in strategies for action that return him to the concrete learning situation 
through the control arrow.
When individuals engage in the process of learning by reflective monitoring of the learn-
ing process they are going through, they can begin to understand important aspects of 
learning: how they move through each stage of the learning cycle, the way their unique 
learning style fits with how they are being taught, and the learning demands of what is 
being taught. This comparison results in strategies for action that can be applied in their 
ongoing learning process.
Learning Identity
A primary metacognitive arena of deliberate learning is one’s self-image as a learner, 
addressing such questions as: Can I learn? How do I learn? How can I improve my learn-

ing capability? At the extreme, if a person does not believe that they can learn, they won’t. 
Learning requires conscious attention, effort, and “time on task.” These activities are a 
waste of time to someone who does not believe that they have the ability to learn. On the 
other hand, there are many successful individuals who attribute their achievements to a 
learning attitude. Oprah Winfrey, for example, has said, “I am a woman in process. I’m 
just trying like everybody else. I try to take every conflict, every experience, and learn 
from it. Life is never dull.”
People with a learning identity see themselves as learners, seek and engage life experi-
ences with a learning attitude, and believe in their ability to learn. Having a learning 
identity is not an either/or proposition. A learning identity develops over time from 
tentatively adopting a learning stance toward life experience, to a more confident learn-
ing orientation, to a learning self that is specific to certain contexts, and ultimately to a 
learning self-identity that permeates deeply into all aspects of the way one lives one’s life. 
This progression is sustained and nurtured through growth-producing relationships in 
one’s life.
In experiential learning theory the concept of learning identity is based on the works 
of Carl Rogers and Paulo Freire. For both of these foundational scholars of experiential 
learning, people who see themselves as learners are those who trust their direct personal 
experiences and their ability to learn from them. Their primary focus is not on immedi-
ate performance or goal achievement but on the ongoing process of learning from these 
experiences. Instead of desiring some fixed goal, they prefer the excitement of being in 
the process of potentialities being born. In his classic paper on how values are learned, 
Carl Rogers emphasizes the central role of experiencing in the learning process of the 
mature person: “He uses his experiencing as a direct referent to which he can turn in 
forming accurate conceptualizations and as a guide to his behavior” (1964, p. 163). The 
process of learning values is, “fluid and flexible. . . highly differentiated. . . the locus of 
evaluation is within the person. . . . There is also involved in this valuing process a letting 
oneself down into the immediacy of what one is experiencing, endeavoring to sense and 
to clarify all its complex meanings” (1964, pp. 163–164). Echoing William James’ radi-
cal empiricism he emphasizes that experiencing includes not only direct sensations and 
emotions but prior concepts: “For there is involved in the present moment of experienc-
ing the memory traces of all the relevant learnings from the past. This moment has not 
only its immediate sensory impact, but it has meaning growing out of similar experiences 
in the past” (1964, p. 164).
He contrasts this approach of a mature learning person with fixed values formed through 
introjections acquired in youth in order to please loved ones: “These conceived prefer-
ences are either not related at all, or not clearly related, to his own process of experi-
encing. Often there is a wide discrepancy between the evidence supplied by his own 
experience and these conceived values. Because these conceptions are not open to testing 
in experience, he must hold them in a rigid and unchanging fashion” (1964, p. 162).
342 
Experiential Learning
In a very different context, Paulo Freire also has emphasized the critical role that learn-
ing centered on one’s own personal experience plays in forming a learning identity. In 
Pedagogy of the Oppressed he describes his literacy work with Brazilian peasant farmers 
helping to liberate them from a self-identity formed through internalized oppression, 
the incorporation and acceptance by individuals within an oppressed group of the preju-
dices against them—“So often do (the oppressed) hear that they are good for nothing, 
know nothing, and are incapable of learning anything—that they are sick, lazy, and 
 unproductive—that in the end they become convinced of their own unfitness” (1970, 
p. 49). His method for achieving the personal and social transformations necessary to 
escape this negative, fixed self-identity was to facilitate the creation of critical conscious-
ness in these farmers through his version of the experiential learning cycle which he 
called praxis, “reflection and action on the world in order to transform it.” In a defini-
tion echoing metacognition, Leistyna (2004) defines critical consciousness as presence 
of mind in the process of learning and knowing—the ability to analyze, pose problems, 
and change the political and cultural realities that affect our lives.
Freire argues that traditional education also promotes a form of internalized oppression 
and a non-learning identity. It is based on a “banking concept” where all-knowing teach-
ers deposit ideas in students’ minds to be received uncritically, mechanically memorized, 
and repeated. He offers the alternative of “problem-posing education” that empowers 
a learning self-identity. It is based on a democratic relationship between student and 
teacher that begins with the here-and-now experience of students’ lives and encourages 
the praxis of critical reflection and action to improve their lives.
If there is a starting point for learning from experience it must be in the belief that one 
can learn and develop from one’s life experiences. In our many years of sharing results 
from the Kolb Learning Style Inventory with thousands of people, we have discovered to 
our surprise that not only do most people not understand their unique way of learning, 
many have not thought about what learning is and themselves as learners. More people 
than we imagined do not think of themselves as learners at all and have what psycholo-
gist Carol Dweck calls a “fixed” view of themselves, in varying degrees believing that they 
are incapable of learning.
It is possible to develop a learning identity. Research studies have shown that educational 
interventions can influence the development of a learning identity. Blackwell, Trzesn-
iewski, and Dweck found that eight 25-minute classes for seventh graders focused on the 
message that “learning changes the brain by forming new connections and that students 
are in charge of this process” (2007, p. 254) led to increased classroom motivation and 
reversed a decline in grades experienced by the control group. Similarly, Good, Aronson, 
and Inzlicht (2003) found that an incremental learning intervention led to significant 
improvements in adolescents’ achievement test scores, and Aronson, Fried, and Good 
(2002) found that such teaching led to higher grades among college students.
343
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
Another example in higher education has focused on the difficult problem of math-
ematics anxiety and the sense of inferiority many students feel when required to 
take remedial mathematics education. Hutt (2007) implemented an experiential 
“learning to learn” course focused on transforming students’ math learning identity 
from one of anxious inferiority (“I don’t do math”) to one of confident self efficacy 
(“I can totally do math”) as well as improving students’ math learning performance 
in developmental mathematics courses. Results from this research showed that the 
experiential course content and the teachers’ conscious attention to unconscious 
processes in the learning space, combined with the students’ reflections on their 
learning experiences and self-talk, had a positive impact on learning. Students’ 
mathematics anxiety was reduced, with students in the course feeling safer, more 
confident, and efficacious about themselves as learners. Students in the “learning to 
learn” course performed a letter grade better than controls in their developmental 
math course. Students’ learning style preferences played an interesting role in the 
findings. Typically in mathematics courses, students with an abstract “thinking” 
learning style preference, which tends to match that of their instructor’s teaching 
style, perform better than students with other learning styles. This learning style 
difference was erased for students in the experiential course where students of all 
learning style preferences earned better grades than controls. Hutt maintains that 
change from a fixed to a learning self-identity requires a safe learning space charac-
terized by unconditional positive regard (Rogers, 1951) from the teacher. This space 
reduces defensive behavior and allows persons to experience themselves as learners 
in a new way.
Becoming a learner, someone who can say with confidence “I am a learner,” is not 
accomplished overnight. One’s self-identity is deeply held and defended against expe-
riences that contradict it. For the vast majority of us our self-identity is a mix of fixed 
and learning beliefs. We may feel that we are good at learning some things like sports 
and not good at others like mathematics. Dweck and her colleagues argue that lay 
theories are domain specific; for example, one can believe that intelligence is fixed 
and morality is learned (Levy, Plaks, Hong, Chiu, and Dweck, 2001). Every success or 
failure can trigger a reassessment of one’s learning ability.
Figure 8.6 depicts self-identity as balancing characteristics that reinforce a fixed self—
negative self-talk, avoidance of risk and failure, and being threatened by the successes 
of others—and those that build a learning self—trusting one’s ability to learn from 
experience, seeking new experiences and challenges, persistence, learning from mis-
takes, and using other’s success as a source of learning.
There are a number of metacognitive strategies for developing a positive learning iden-
tity that can tip the balance toward becoming a learner.
344 
Experiential Learning
Trust Your Experience Place experience at the center of your learning process, making 
it the focal point of choices and decisions. This does not mean that you shouldn’t learn 
from experts or the experience of others since this advice is also part of your experience. 
The key is to own your choices and validate them in your experience. When you do this, 
you take charge of your learning and your life.
Trust the Learning Process Avoid an excessive focus on the outcomes of immedi-
ate performance and focus instead on the longer-term recursive process of learning 
by  tracking your performance progress over time. Rarely is a single performance test 
a matter of life and death, and to treat it as such only reinforces a fixed identity. Every 
performance is an occasion for learning and improvement in future performances.
Redefine Your Relationship to Failure No one likes to fail but failure is an inevitable part 
of doing something new. Thomas Edison provided a role model for the learning response 
to failure when he argued that failure is the most important ingredient for success. James 
Dyson, the inventor of the Dyson vacuum cleaner and founder of Dyson, Inc, sees Edison 
as a role model saying he, “achieved great success through repeated failure. His 10,000 
failures pale in comparison to his 1,093 U.S. patents. Each one of Edison’s inventions, from 
the Dictaphone to the light bulb came from his inability to give up” (Yang, 2008, p. 28).
Failures can also help focus your priorities and life path on your talents and strengths. In

(2008) described the low period in her life after graduation, which was marked by failure 
on every front, and talked about its benefits as leaving her with a new sense of focus on 
the only type of work that was important to her. In her address she reflected that if she 
had not failed, she never would have had the energy and motivation to spend her time 
writing, an area where she truly belonged. Failure, she found, created a sense of freedom 
to focus on her area of expertise.
Let Go of Strong Emotional Responses in Order to Learn from Failure Failures, losses, 
and mistakes provoke inevitable emotional responses. Yet it is important to learn to reg-
ulate emotional reactions that block learning and feed into a fixed identity. Golfers who 
slam their club and curse themselves and the game after a bad shot lose the opportunity 
to coolly analyze their mistake and plan for corrections on the next hole. An effective 
way to deal with the emotions that follow judging oneself a failure is to breathe calmly 
and intentionally while accepting the current moment as it is. This enables a clearer mind 
with which to move forward.
Risk Losing Joel Waitzkin in The Art of Learning provides a handbook of his metacog-
nitive learning based on his process of becoming first a chess master and then a martial 
arts champion. He emphasizes the importance of losing in order to learn how to win. “If 
a big strong guy comes into a martial arts studio and someone pushes him, he wants to 
resist and push the guy back to prove that he is a big strong guy. The problem is that he 
isn’t learning anything by doing this. In order to grow, he needs to give up his current 
mindset” (2007, p. 107).
Reassess Your Beliefs about How You Learn and What You Are Good At It is impor-
tant to consciously reflect on and choose how you define yourself as a learner. Often 
people are unaware of the way in which they characterize themselves and their  abilities.
Monitor the Messages You Send Yourself Pay attention to your self-talk. Saying to 
yourself, “I am stupid” or “I am no good at. . .” matters and reinforces a negative fixed 
identity; just as saying, “I can do this” reinforces a positive learning identity. Beware of 
internalized oppression. Some of these messages are introjections from others that you 
have swallowed without careful examination.
Balance Your Success/Failure Accounts Most of us remember our failures more vividly 
than our successes. For example, in our experience as teachers we both tend to focus on 
the one or two negative remarks in our course ratings and ignore the praise and positive 
reactions. The danger of this type of focus is adjusting one’s teaching style to suit one 
or two negative comments and risking losing the majority of positive experiences in the 
room. A deeper danger is that such a focus will negatively shape longer-term thoughts 
and behaviors about oneself (Blackwell, Trzesniewski, and Dweck, 2007, pp. 259–260). 
Sometimes it is useful to make an inventory of learning strengths and successes to bal-
ance your accounts.
346 
Experiential Learning
Learning Style
In addition to believing in ourselves as learners, it is also important to understand how 
it is that we learn best, our learning style. An understanding of one’s unique learning 
preferences and capabilities, and the match between these and the demands of learning 
tasks, can increase learning effectiveness. It can suggest why performance is not optimal 
and suggest strategies for improvement, as well as help explain why some topics and 
courses are interesting and others are painful. It can also help explain why some develop a 
non-learning self-identity. Our most gratifying experiences in teaching individuals about 
their learning style have been when they come up and say, “My whole life I thought I was 
stupid because I didn’t do well in school. Now I realize that it is just because I learn in a 
different way than schools teach.”
Those who use the Kolb LSI to assess their learning style often decide that they wish to 
develop their capacity to engage in one or more of the four learning modes: experienc-
ing (CE), reflecting (RO), thinking (AC), and acting (AE). In some cases this is based on 
a desire to develop a weak mode in their learning style. In others it may be to increase 
capability in a mode that is particularly important for their learning tasks. Because of the 
dialectic relationships among the learning modes, containing the inhibiting effects of 
opposing learning modes can be as effective in getting into a mode as actively trying to 
express it. Overall learning effectiveness is improved when individuals are highly skilled 
in engaging all four modes of the learning cycle. One way to develop in the learning 
modes is to develop the skills associated with them. The Learning Skills Profile (Boyatzis 
and Kolb, 1995, 1997) was created to help learners assess the learning skills associated 
with the four modes of the learning cycle—interpersonal skills for CE, information skills 
for RO, analytic skills for AC, and action skills for AE.
Developing the Capacity for Experiencing Experiencing requires fully opening one-
self to direct experience. Direct experience exists only in the here-and-now, a present 
moment of endless depth and extension that can never be fully comprehended. In fact, 
the thinking mode, being too much “in your head,” can inhibit the ability to directly sense 
and feel the immediate moment. Engagement in concrete experience can be enhanced by 
being present in the moment and attending to direct sensations and feelings. This pres-
ence and attention are particularly important for interpersonal relationships. Interper-
sonal skills of leadership, relationship, and giving and receiving help in the development 
and expression of the experiencing mode of learning.
Developing the Capacity for Reflecting Reflection requires space and time for it to take 
place. It can be inhibited by impulsive desires and/or pressures to take action. It can be 
enhanced by the practice of deliberately viewing things from a different perspective and 
empathy. Stillness and quieting the mind foster deep reflection. Information skills of 
sense making, information gathering, and information analysis can aid in the develop-
ment and expression of the reflecting mode of learning.
347
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
Developing the Capacity for Thinking Thinking requires the ability to represent and 
manipulate ideas in your head. It can be distracted by intense direct emotion and sen-
sations as well as pressure to act quickly. Engagement in thinking can be enhanced by 
practicing theoretical model building and the creation of scenarios for action. Analytical 
skills of theory building, quantitative data analysis, and technology management can aid 
in the development and expression of the thinking mode of learning.
Developing the Capacity for Action Acting requires commitment and involvement in 
the practical world of real consequences. In a sense it is the “bottom line” of the learning 
cycle, the place where internal experiencing, reflecting, and thinking are tested in reality. 
Acting can be inhibited by too much internal processing in any of these three modes. 
Acting can be enhanced by courageous initiative taking and the creation of cycles of goal 
setting and feedback to monitor performance. Action skills of initiative, goal setting, and 
action taking can aid in the development and expression of the acting mode of learning.
Increasing Learning Flexibility The flexibility to move from one learning mode to 
the other in the learning cycle is important for effective learning. Learning flexibility as 
assessed in the Kolb Learning Style Inventory 4.0 measures the extent that individuals 
change their learning style as the demands of context and learning task require. By devel-
oping capacities in all four of the learning modes one can increase their ability to flexibly 
change style to move around the learning cycle (Chapter 4, pp. 146–151).
Learning Relationships
Another important area for the metacognitive monitoring and control of learning is 
learning relationships. Most learning involves others in some way. Experiential learning 
theory defines learning relationships as connections between one or more individuals 
that promote growth and movement through the learning spiral, ultimately inspiring 
future learning and relationship building. Hunt (1987) suggests that parallel learning 
spirals are shared between individuals in human interaction. People relate to one another 
in a pattern of alternating “reading” and “flexing” that mirrors the experiential learning 
process. When one person is reading—receiving feedback (CE) and formulating percep-
tions (RO)—the other person is flexing—creating intentions based on those perceptions 
(AC) and acting on them (AE). As the exchange continues, their modes of experiencing 
shift back and forth. However, many interactions take place without mindful awareness 
of perception and intention, creating a sequence of feedback and action that bypasses key 
steps in the learning process. Those who seek to support the learning process in others 
can activate modes of experiencing in others by asking key questions that draw out dif-
ferent learning responses (Abbey, Hunt, and Weiser, 1985).
Teachers, mentors, advisors, family, and friends all can influence learning for better or 
worse. The key metacognitive strategy for managing learning relationships is to focus on 
and develop those that are growth-producing and to minimize and contain encounters 
with those “toxic” relationships that undermine learning and one’s learning identity. 
348 
Experiential Learning
Our research (Passarelli and Kolb, 2011) suggests that there is no minimum number 
of interactions for a learning relationship to take form. When asked who has recently 
impacted their learning growth and development, some learners told stories of a recent 
acquaintance making a positive impact on their learning journey. Others, however, were 
impacted by long-standing, close relationships with individuals such as a spouse, sibling, 
or mentor. What was common to all of the stories is that learners expressed a baseline 
level of positive feelings or perceptions of the other, even when the content of the inter-
action was not positive. Miller and Stiver (1997) suggest that relationships that foster 
growth are formed through interactions that are characterized by mutual empathy and 
empowerment. These interactions, or connections, need not always be positive, but they 
must include reciprocal engagement of both thought and emotion. The tone that arises 
from mutual empathy and empowerment creates the conditions for mutual growth 
where individuals experience an increase in their vitality, ability to take action, clarity 
about themselves and their relationship, sense of self-worth, and desire to form more 
connections. A connection is constituted by an interaction or series of interactions that 
build toward a deeper relationship. Similar to Fletcher and Ragins’ (2007) description 
of the development of a mentoring relationship through a series of small “episodes,” 
learning relationships evolve as learning interactions increase in quality and frequency. 
Each interaction carries with it a sentiment, or emotional charge, that sets the tone for 
learning. Interactions characterized by compassion, respect, and support build the trust 
and positive emotional resources necessary to create space for learning—even when 
learning is challenging.
Learning relationships can have a powerful impact on learning identity for better or 
worse. Some relationships can reinforce a fixed identity or create a codependency 
that does not allow for learning flexibility and growth. We have already seen Rog-
ers’ description of the lasting power that introjected evaluations from loved ones can 
have. Evaluations from others can also influence learning identity, sometimes in unex-
pected and subtle ways. Dweck (2000) has shown that teachers who reward students 
for successful learning by praising them for being “smart” actually promote a fixed 
identity and less expenditure of study effort—“I don’t need to study because I am 
smart.” Learning identity may be contagious in the sense that those who have a learn-
ing identity tend to create relationships that stimulate it in others and those with fixed 
identities also act in ways that pass on fixed views of others. For example, those with 
a fixed versus incremental view of themselves show greater stereotype endorsement, 
perceive greater out-group homogeneity, and show greater intergroup bias and more 
biased behavior toward out-group members. They are more susceptible to the funda-
mental attribution error—believing that others’ actions indicate the “kind” of person 
they are, underestimating the influence of situational factors on their behavior (Levy 
et al., 2001). One of our respondents describes how this contagion may be passed on 
through generations:

Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
In the introduction I mentioned my Father and the impact that his upbring-
ing has had on my Learning Style. I can recall stories of my Father describing 
a childhood in which he was shown very little love and was repeatedly told he 
was stupid. He was told that he wouldn’t understand things. To this day, my 
Grandmother still says to him that she will tell him [confidential things] when 
he is old enough to understand. He is 63 years old. As a child, I remember my 
Father’s dislike for any kind of game. On the rare occasion when he would play, 
he got angry and frustrated if he didn’t do well and often quit. I now know that 
my father developed a “fixed” self-concept around learning. He was told he was 
stupid and wouldn’t understand and therefore, in his mind, he was and didn’t. 
He also criticizes educated people, which I can now link to the fixed self-identity. 
This fixed self-concept has implications beyond his attitude towards games—it 
impacted my learning development. As a child, I often heard my father ask me 
“what were you thinking?” when I did something wrong. I believe that contrib-
uted to the lack of confidence I have with my decision-making. [Passarelli and 
Kolb 2011, p. 88]
Learning Times and Spaces
In the previous update and reflection (Chapter 7 Update and Reflections, pp. 288–290) 
I described the concept of learning space, emphasizing that learning needs a space to 
happen and the nature of that space can either facilitate or hinder learning. It is a founda-
tional truism of social psychology that we humans are greatly influenced by the situations 
we are in. Studies show powerful tendencies to conform to social norms and the influence 
of others (Janis, 1972) while evidence for the influence of individual characteristics shows 
only modest effects on behavior (Mischel, 1984). It is for this reason that metacognitive 
monitoring and control of one’s learning time and space is so important. With this per-
spective one can exercise some choice in the learning spaces and times one makes and 
create the kind of learning space that best facilitates their learning. When embarking on 
a course of learning, it is useful to consider the learning spaces where this learning will 
happen and to customize these spaces for yourself based on your learning style and the 
particular subject matter of your learning. When teachers plan their courses, they may or 
may not explicitly consider the kind of learning spaces they are creating and the appro-
priateness of these spaces for the students in their course and/or for the material being 
taught. For example, John and Tanya Reese (1998) created “Connecting with the Profes-
sor” workshops to help law students bridge the differences between the learning spaces 
created by law school professors and their own learning space preferences resulting from 
their individual learning styles. Recognizing that law school professors were unlikely to 
change their course and learning style, they worked with students to develop the learn-
ing skills needed to succeed in the learning spaces created by their professors. Another 
strategy is to supplement the learning space that is given with other spaces that suit your 
350 
Experiential Learning
style. For example, a person who learns best by imagining may want to form a group of 
classmates to talk about the material in the course, or a thinking-style person may want 
to prepare in advance by reading about material to be covered in the course.
The principles for the creation of an effective space for experiential learning described 
in the previous chapter (Chapter 7 Update and Reflections, pp. 295–299) can serve as a 
metacognitive guide to assess one’s current learning space or to create a new one. For a 
learner to engage fully in the learning cycle, a space must be provided to engage fully in 
the four modes of the cycle—experiencing, reflecting, thinking, and acting. It needs to be 
a hospitable, welcoming space that is characterized by respect for all. It needs to provide 
an optimal balance of support and challenge, reminding us of Vygotsky’s (1978) con-
cept of the proximal zone of development where the learner is supported in incremental 
learning by models that set challenging but achievable goals. It must allow learners to be 
in charge of their own learning and allow time for the repetitive practice that develops 
expertise.
Mindful Experiencing
I spoke earlier in this chapter of awakening to experience and James’ reminder that we 
create our experiences by the choices we make, “My experience is what I agree to attend 
to” (1890, p. 403). I have also described two techniques for awakening to present experi-
ence, focusing based on Rogers and Gendlin’s experiencing method and mindfulness 
(Chapter 2 Update and Reflections). These metacognitive practices for mindful expe-
riencing are aimed at helping the individual to focus on present and direct experience 
by being intentionally aware and attentive and accepting life as an emergent process of 
change. Our research on mindfulness and experiential learning (Yeganeh, 2006; Yeganeh 
and Kolb, 2009) suggests that the practice of mindfulness can help individuals learn from 
experience by enhancing presence and intentional attention.
Yeganeh (2006) studied two predominant streams of mindfulness research and prac-
tice: meditative mindfulness and socio-cognitive mindfulness. Meditative mindfulness 
is the core of Buddhist meditation, advocating the development of mindfulness through 
a discipline of anchoring the mind in the present moment. This is often accompanied 
with a practice of awareness and acceptance through breathing. Kabat-Zinn (1994, 2003) 
defines mindfulness as “paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present 
moment, and non-judgmentally” (1994 p. 4). Non-judgment, in mindfulness theory, 
is accepting the current state as part of a constant flow of changing experiences. This 
paradigm suggests that letting go of judgment strengthens the mind, and it challenges 
the illusion that over-thinking something gives one control over it. Authors who discuss 
mindfulness within these parameters also talk about the antithesis of mindfulness, which 
is mindlessness, or a state of autopilot and lack of intention.
Socio-cognitive mindfulness emphasizes cognitive categorization, context, and situ-
ational awareness. Ellen Langer relates mindfulness to learning: “When we are mindful, 
351
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
we implicitly or explicitly (1) view a situation from several perspectives, (2) see informa-
tion presented in the situation as novel, (3) attend to the context in which we perceive the 
information, and eventually (4) create new categories through which this information 
may be understood” (1997, p. 111). Mindfulness, from the socio-cognitive perspective, 
requires broadening one’s repertoire of cognitive categories. The idea of creating new 
categories was influenced by Langer’s earlier studies in bias and prejudice. Explaining 
the practical benefits she illustrates that “If we describe someone we dislike intensely, a 
single statement usually does it. But if, instead, we are forced to describe the person in 
great detail, eventually there will be some quality we appreciate” (1989, p. 66). One of 
the reasons Langer’s work is so compelling is that it thoroughly supports the notion that 
simple labels (e.g., good and evil) do not accurately reflect the complexity of the world. 
Instead, they allow for mindless rationalizations that justify a broad range of dysfunc-
tional behaviors, from ineffective to criminal.
One way to distinguish the two schools of thought is that meditative mindfulness, with its 
focus on present-centered awareness, describes an internal process required to maintain 
a mindful state of present experiencing, whereas socio-cognitive mindfulness focuses 
on cognitive applications of mindfulness to more effectively sort out experiences and 
make sense of the world based on new mental categories/models. Furthermore, medita-
tive mindfulness authors offer techniques in practicing mindfulness through breathing, 
acceptance, and present-centered awareness. Socio-cognitive mindfulness deemphasizes 
meditation, suggesting supplemental practices such as placing a value on doubt, looking 
for disconfirming data, and producing new ways of thinking and acting. Yeganeh (2006) 
offers a multidimensional definition of mindfulness that encompasses both approaches. 
Mindful experiencing is a state in which an individual focuses on present and direct 
experience, is intentionally aware and attentive, and accepts life as an emergent process 
of change. Supporting these links between learning from experience and mindfulness, his 
research found that individuals who scored high on Langer’s mindfulness scale empha-
sized direct concrete experience in their learning style while also scoring lower on reflec-
tive observation, suggesting that they were not “lost in thought” or rumination but were 
attentive to their experiences. The results suggest two mindful experiencing practices to 
help individuals learn from experience.
Encouraging a Focus on Here-and-Now Experience Uncluttered by Preconceptions and 
Bias To be present and engaged in direct experience, one must anchor in present-
centered awareness by attending to the five senses. One of the strongest ways to attend 
to the present moment is through calm and aware breathing. Attending to the present 
moment serves to quiet the mind; reducing automatic, habitual patterns of thinking and 
responding. This presence enhances concrete experience and allows the learning cycle to 
begin. In a sense, we cannot learn from experience if we do not first have an experience, 
and, often, automatic routines make it difficult for direct experiencing in the moment 
to occur.

Experiential Learning
Intentionally Guiding Their Learning Process by Paying Attention to How They Are 
Going through the Phases of the Learning Cycle By intentionally guiding the learning 
process and paying attention to the process of one’s progression through the phases of 
the learning cycle, we can make ourselves through learning. How and what we learn 
determines the way we process the possibilities of each new emerging experience, which 
in turn determines the range of choices and decisions we see. The choices and decisions 
we make, to some extent, determine the events we live through, and these events influ-
ence our future choices. Thus, we create ourselves through the choices of the actual occa-
sions we live through. For many, this learning style choice is relatively unconscious, an 
autopilot program for learning. Mindful experiencing can put the control of our learning 
and our life back in our hands.
Deliberate Practice
We all know that learning involves repeated practice. However, time spent practicing 
does not necessarily lead to learning and improved performance. Practice is not just the 
amount of time doing something, so experience with something alone is not a good pre-
dictor of performance. Going to the golf practice range and hitting bucket after bucket of 
balls doesn’t necessarily improve your game and in fact may make it worse by ingraining 
bad habits. Expert performance research initiated in the early 1990s by K. Anders Erics-
son (Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-Römer, 1993; Ericsson and Charness, 1994; Ericsson, 
2006; Baron and Henry, 2010) teaches a great deal about learning from practice. The 
good news from this work is that greatness, for the most part, is not a function of innate 
talent; it is learned from experience. The not-so-good news is that it involves long-term 
commitment (ten years or 10,000 hours for many top experts) and a particular kind of 
practice that is hard work, called deliberate practice.
The basic techniques of deliberate practice are useful for improving our ability to learn 
from experience. Essentially, deliberate practice involves intense concentrated, repeated 
performance that is compared against an ideal or “correct” model of the performance. 
It requires feedback that compares the actual performance against the ideal to identify 
“errors” that are corrected in subsequent performance attempts. In this sense deliberate 
practice can be seen as mindful experiencing with the addition of focused reflection on 
a concrete performance experience that is analyzed against a metacognitive ideal model 
to improve future action in a recurring cycle of learning. Learning relationships can be 
of great help in deliberate practice by providing expert models, feedback, and support for 
the focused effort required. Daniel Coyle (2009) emphasizes that this kind of practice is 
difficult work requiring focused attention, thoughtful analysis, and continuous repeti-
tion to eliminate mistakes and reach goals. He argues that most can only engage in this 
deep learning activity for a couple of hours at a time. Yet, little of importance is learned 
in one sitting. In Mastery, George Leonard describes the master’s journey as a path that 
follows a recurring cycle of brief spurts of progress followed by dips of performance and 
a plateau of performance that is slightly higher than before where nothing seems to be 
353
Chapter 8 Lifelong Learning and Integrative Development 
happening until the next spurt. For many this path, particularly the long plateaus, proves 
frustrating and efforts to learn and develop are abandoned. Leonard advises, “To put it 
simply, you practice diligently, but you practice primarily for the sake of practice itself. 
Rather than being frustrated while on the plateau, you learn to appreciate and enjoy it as 
much as you do the upward surges” (1991, p. 17).
Ongoing deliberate practice can be seen as a learning spiral of recursive progression 
through the learning cycle over time. A key to learning success is the establishment of 
the appropriate time frame expectation for its achievement. The most common time-
framing error is the expectation of a “quick fix” and instant mastery. When it doesn’t 
happen, the learning effort is abandoned. Learning to control one’s weight is perhaps the 
best example. To embark on a “Lose 10 pounds in 10 days” diet is to limit oneself to one 
turn through the learning cycle; while weight control is a long-term process with spirals 
of learning around many issues (calorie intake, exercise, etc.) and many contexts. The 
inertia of old habits takes time to change, and setbacks and failures are inevitable. By 
framing the learning process correctly as one that will happen with slow progress over 
time, quitting and negative fixed self-attributions can be avoided.
Self-Making and the Development of Interest The deliberate practice spiral of learning 
is applicable not only to the development of specific skills and subject matter, but it also 
applies to self-development in general. Self-development proceeds through the identi-
fication and development of a person’s interests. It occurs through an ongoing spiral of 
learning that refines, deepens, and extends an initial interest in something. Interest is the 
spine of the learning spiral; the result of the self-referential autopoeitic process. The spine 
of the learning spiral represents interest in James’ spiral of interest-attention-selection 
which, as he says using another metaphor, is “the very keel on which our mental ship is 
built” (Leary 1992, p. 157). We attend to those things which draw our interest and select 
those experiences which allow our interests to be explored and deepened in a continuing 
spiral of learning. John Dewey, James’ colleague, describes the developmental aspects 
of this process, “I believe that interests are the signs and symptoms of growing power. 
I believe that they represent dawning capacities. . . showing the state of development 
which the child has reached (and) the stage upon which he is about to enter” (1897, p. 
79). To trust these signs of growing power and nurture the growth of one’s interests is 
to follow the learning way.
Learning How to Learn
Finally, let us examine how the above metacognitive skills of deliberate learning can be 
developed increasing the ability to learn how to learn. Returning to Figure 8.5, I have 
emphasized thus far two cycles of learning shown in the illustration. The cycle of learning 
at the experience level represents the learner’s actual concrete learning experience. The 
cycle at the meta-level describes the learner’s normative model of how his learning should 
be. A closer look at Figure 8.5 reveals that the monitoring and control arrows between 
354 
Experiential Learning
one’s metacognitive model of experiential learning and his/her  learning  experience com-
plete another cycle of experiential learning. This third learning cycle describes how indi-
viduals develop their meta-level model of learning, that is, how they learn about their 
learning process.
Current metacognitive research suggests that these three cycles do not operate simulta-
neously but sequentially. For example, judgments of how well one has learned something 
are less accurate when they are made immediately than when they are delayed for some 
time (Nelson, 1996). When one is immersed in a learning task like solving math prob-
lems, they may not be thinking much about their meta-model of how they should be 
going about the task and not at all about perfecting that meta-model. The meta-model 
of learning may be most useful prior to engagement in learning and for “after-action 
review.” It can be used to plan strategies for engaging and mastering the immediate 
learning task.
The learning about learning cycle requires a longer time perspective and reflection on 
previous learning experiences and their fit with the metacognitive normative learning 
model. We have already seen that educational interventions can facilitate this process 
and improve learning effectiveness (Blackwell, Trzesniewski, and Dweck, 2007; Good, 
Aronson, and Inzlicht, 2003; Hutt, 2007; Reese, 1998). Supportive learning relationships 
and learning spaces are often essential to explore and change a deeply held learning iden-
tity and unconscious learning habits. Ultimately, however, it is the learner who manages 
their learning about learning and takes control of their learning process through meta-
cognitive monitoring and control. Learners can chart their path on the learning way by 
developing their metacognitive learning capacities and educators can pave the way by 
placing learning about learning on the agenda of their educational programs.
