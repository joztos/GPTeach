ABSTRACT In traditional learning environments, it is easy for a teacher to get an accurate and deep 
understanding about how students are learning and undertaking tasks. This results in teacher understanding 
about each student’s learning preferences and behavior, which exhibits, for instance, students’ learning 
styles and affective states. On the other hand, identification of learning styles and affective states in web-
based learning environments is quite challenging. The existing approaches for the identification of learning 
styles such as questionnaire is not without limitations. Similarly, affective states identification approaches 
mentioned in the literature indicate several shortcomings. This paper proposes an automatic approach for 
the identification of learning styles and affective states in web-based Learning Management Systems 
(LMSs). The unique feature of this approach is that it is generic in nature. Using this approach, the students 
learning styles and affective states are calculated automatically from their learning preferences and behavior 
within a course. Evaluation of this approach was performed by following a study with 81 students. The 
results of the study were then compared with the learning styles and affective states questionnaires, which 
demonstrate that the suggested approach is more appropriate for the identification of learning styles and 
affective states.  Therefore, using this approach, a tool (AsLim) has been developed and can be used by the 
teachers for the identification of learning styles and affective states of their students.

INTRODUCTION 
The adaptive systems that were developed earlier, are 
either based on the user’s knowledge, interest, and 
background etc. On the other hand, recent research is 
emphasizing over developing learning styles and 
affective states based adaptive systems, due to their high 
significance towards learning. Adaptive systems that are 
based on either learning styles or affective states usually 
adopt a collaborative approach for student modelling by 
intimating students to fill out a concerned survey 
questionnaire. Regarding learning styles, questionnaires 
have been criticized due to its static nature, as it 
describes learning styles of students in a particular 
environment and at a specific point [1]. Furthermore, this 
type of measurement can be slanted due to its 
dependency on the judgment of students. Similarly, 
regarding affective states, recent research indicates that 
subjective assessment with questionnaires is far from 
ideal due to the difficulty that students have in 
identifying their own affective states. Feldman et al., [2] 
also highlighted similar issues with the use of 
questionnaires, and concluded that rather than asking 
students about their learning preferences and providing 
explicit information about their state of learning 
behavior, their actual preferences and state of learning 
behavior can be exploited as an efficient source for the 
identification of their learning styles and affective states. 
Research conducted so far focuses only over the 
identification of learning styles in various learning 
environments, but affective states are continuously 
ignored. Although learning styles and affective states are 
equally important and both contribute towards the

students’ learning process. Therefore, this research 
introduces an automatic approach of student modelling 
for the detection of learning styles and affective states in 
the web-based learning environments such as LMSs.  
A concept of students’ tracking, for example, how they 
are learning and demonstrating in a LMS, and using 
these information to infer the learning preferences and 
behavior of students is used. This approach has the 
capability of overcoming the problems associated with 
the use of questionnaires for the identification of 
learning styles as well as verbal, nonverbal, and intrusive 
approaches used for the identification of affective states. 
In an automatic student modelling approach, extra effort 
at the students’ end is not needed for obtaining 
information regarding their learning styles and affective 
states. They only need to interact with system, and the 
system, on the basis of their preferences, behavior and 
actions, infers their learning styles and affective states. 
The information obtained using this approach is more 
authentic and error free. [3] Kay & Kummerfeld and 
Liyanage et al., [4] also indicated that this approach (i.e. 
data obtained from students log files and records) has the 
potential to overcome the challenge of developing useful 
student model for effective adaptive technologies. 
Furthermore, Shute & Zapata-Rivera [5] described that 
the data obtained from student log files and records 
represents an untapped, wasted resource that could be 
used for developing rich student model. 
 
Automatic approach for student modelling can be more 
reliable and beneficial due to the longer time span for 
information gathering. Moreover, owing to the feasibility 
of frequent collection and analysis of students' behavior 
and actions, the automatic approach for student 
modelling can update the information in student model 
by identifying this change. The two main features make 
the automatic student modelling more prominent as 
compared to the other approaches employed for 
identifying the learning styles and the affective states. 
The first feature deals with developing a student model 
regarding the learning styles and the affective states from 
scratch. The second feature deals with updating and 
improving the already existing student model. 
 
This paper is organized as follows: an overview of the 
related research work, which deals with an automatic 
student modelling with respect to the learning styles and 
affective states in web-based learning environments, is 
provided in the next subsection. In Section III, an 
automatic approach of student modelling for detecting 
the learning styles and affective states in LMSs is 
presented. Within this section, first of all, generic issues 
dealing with the discovery of relevant behavioral patterns 
for the identification of learning styles and affective 
states are discussed. Afterwards, for inferring the 
learning styles and the affective states from determined 
preferences and behavior respectively, two approaches 
namely the literature-based approach and the data-driven 
approach, are introduced. Moreover, for the purpose of 
evaluating these two approaches of automatic student 
modelling, a study is presented in the section IV. Finally, 
the discussion and conclusion is presented in section VI.

RELATED WORK 
This section presents an overview of the related research 
work, which deals with the automatic student modelling 
in relation to the learning styles and affective states. 
 
A. LEARNING STYLES 
Karagiannis & Satratzemi [6] presented an automatic 
approach for the detection of learning styles in Moodle 
with the objective of providing adaptive courses. This 
approach initially exploits a questionnaire such as Index 
of Learning Styles (ILS) for detecting the students’ 
learning styles. Later on, students’ interaction data is 
exploited by a data mining technique for updating the 
student model. Similarly, Liyanage et al. [4] applied a 
classification algorithm, namely J48 decision tree, for the 
prediction of students’ learning styles by analyzing the 
Moodle log data.  
 
Likewise, regarding identifying the students' learning 
styles, WELSA [7] adopted  automatic student modelling 
approach. The WELSA data analysis tool interprets the 
preferences of students and consequently builds and 
updates the student model. Similarly, the EDUCE [8] 
employs a blended approach for students modelling. In 
this system, when learners log in for the first time, they 
are emphasized to fill out multiple intelligence inventory 
named MIDAS (Multiple Intelligences Developmental 
Assessment Scales). This information is then used to 
determine their Multiple Intelligences (MI) profile and 
highest ranking intelligence. Regarding the MI profile, 
EDUCE maintains a static profile and a dynamic profile. 
A static profile is used for the initialization of student 
model and is generated from the MIDAS filled in by the 
learner, and a dynamic profile is generated by the system 
based on the learner behavior and navigation. 
 
Cha et al., [9] through the pattern extraction module 
collected the behavioral patterns of learners regarding 
each learning style dimension mentioned by Felder and 
Silverman, from the user interface. The data regarding 
the patterns was then analyzed using two different types 
of machine learning techniques such as Hidden Markov 
Models (HMM) [10] and Decision Trees (DT) [11]. In 
this regard, an experiment was conducted with 70 
students using an online course in the intelligent learning 
environment on the basis of respective patterns. Initially,

the students were required to fill out the ILS 
questionnaire 
in 
order 
to 
assess 
their 
learning 
preferences. However, in this experiment, only that data 
of ILS questionnaire was evaluated that indicates either a 
moderate or strong preference for the respective learning 
style dimension. 
 
Then the respective students' behavior for the interface 
was observed for deriving the students' learning style 
preference from the events of interface with the use of 
HMM and DT. Since, the proposed approach only 
considers the data when students have a strong or a 
moderate preference, this makes proposed approach only 
capable of being applied for the identification of learning 
style preference of students when students have a strong 
or moderate preference on either one or other pole of a 
specific dimension. Therefore, it is required to further 
investigate the approach which is highly accurate and 
incorporates the balanced preference as well. Similarly, 
Graf et al., [12] exploited automatic student modelling 
approach. They investigated learning preferences of 
students when considering adaptivity on the basis of 
learning styles in the LMSs. This approach looks into 
only detecting learning styles and ignores the behavior of 
students with respect to detecting affective states in 
LMSs. 
 
B. AFFECTIVE STATES 
Rajendran [13] developed an approach for the 
identification of affective states using log file analysis. 
This approach analyses the student interactions in an 
intelligent tutoring system i.e. Mindspark. However, this 
research considered only one affective state i.e. 
frustration, out of the six affective states reported by 
Bakera et al., [14].  Similarly, Salmeron-Majadas et al., 
[15] proposed a set of indicators such as keystrokes, 
digraphs and trigraphs, and mouse clicks and movement, 
derived from the interaction of user with keyboard and 
mouse. The aim of this study was to evaluate their use in 
the identification of affective states through non-
intrusive method in one of the e-learning platform. The 
learners participated in the experiment scored their 
affective 
states’ 
level 
of 
valence 
(emotion’s 
pleasantness) and arousal (emotion’s strength) after each 
mathematical 
problem. 
For 
this 
purpose, 
Self-
Assessment Manikin scale (SAM) was used. SAM is a 
standardized questionnaire that allows users in rating 
their valence as well as arousal. In addition, the 
participants also entered the details about their own 
feelings. The information supplied by those various 
indicators, processed from original interactions logs of 
users, was evaluated with the help of that affective 
marking. A total of 96 mouse and 42 keyboard indicators 
were computed. 
 
Qu et al., [16] while interacting with Virtual Factory 
Teaching System (VFTS) [17] inferred students' 
affective states such as confidence, effort, and confusion 
from student's current task, focus of attention, and 
expected time required for performing the task. For 
inferring the learners’ focus of attention, a Dynamic 
Bayesian Networks (DBNs) [18] was used for combining 
the evidence from learners’ interface actions and eye 
gazes. Subsequently, for the detection of learners’ 
confidence level, effort and confusion, combination of 
the focus of attention and the information regarding 
activities of learners was used with the inference of a 
plan recognizer.  
 
De Vicente & Pain [19] conducted a study for the 
identification of affective states by interacting with the 
systems, such as MOODS, which is a working model of 
ITS having a facilitation of self-reporting with an 
additional motivation to learn Japanese numbers. The 
participants were requested for observing the recorded 
students’ interaction with the MOODS, and inferring and 
commenting on the students’ affective states during 
interaction. In order to identify the students' affective 
states, some rules were formulated on the basis of 
inferences. Their validated results give an indication that 
inferring affective states diagnosis on the basis of 
information provided by the interaction between the 
students and the computer, is feasible. 
 
Hershkovitz & Nachmias [20] argued that affective states 
affect the students' learning process and also explains 
their individual differences. However, it is very difficult 
to evaluate without direct contact with the student. They 
presented an approach which makes it possible to learn 
about the online learners by means of automatically and 
continuously collected digital traces. Affective states 
identification was based upon the three dimensions such 
as engagement, energisation, and source and by the 
seven computable learning variables corresponding to 
these dimensions. The measurement of three dimensions 
were based on the data solely extracted from log files. 
Learning variables, which describe patterns of learner's 
behavior, were identified using the technique of 
analysing Learnogram [21]. 
 
Cocea & Weibelzahl [22] argued that an affective 
(motivation) diagnosis which is based only on the 
interaction between the students and the system is not 
complete in spite of the evident benefits of unnoticeable 
diagnosis. They presented an approach which is founded 
on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [23]. For an affective 
diagnosis, a two-step approach was proposed. First of all, 
the system monitored the learners unobtrusively and 
diagnosed their disconnection on the basis of log files. 
The aim was to distinguish the engaged learners from the

disengaged ones. The purpose of this practices was to 
focus further on disengaged learners. To predict level of 
engagement of the students from log data, eight different 
data mining techniques such as Bayesian nets, Logistic 
regression etc. were applied. The results of study 
concerning the first step were presented and showed 
overall good prediction. The next step was proposed to 
engage the disengaged learners in a dialogue for 
assessing their self-regulation, self-efficacy, and other 
relevant concepts. 
 
III. 
AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION APPROACH FOR 
LEARNING STYLES AND AFFECTIVE STATES 
The approaches described in section II regarding the 
learning styles and affective states are formulated for 
particular learning environments and hence, are 
customized specifically for these learning environments 
with the use of only those features and patterns, which 
are incorporated in the respective learning environments. 
Our proposed approach includes commonly used features 
of the LMSs. Therefore, this approach is capable of 
being applied to the LMSs in general. Nevertheless, 
developing an approach, which is applicable to almost all 
LMSs, is more difficult than developing an approach 
which is applicable to just one particular system. It takes 
into consideration a variety of features supported by 
different LMSs as well as the available data stored in the 
LMSs’ database with respect to each pattern. 
 
The proposed approach of automatically identifying the 
learning styles and the affective states can be divided 
into the two parts. The first part focuses on determining 
the learners’ relevant preferences and behavior. This part 
is normally achieved on the basis of literature regarding 
the relevant learning style model and also the affective 
states factors or models. This part also involves 
investigations regarding the included features and 
patterns, the relevant patterns related to each learning 
style dimension and affective state, and the thresholds 
for classification of data. The second part focuses on 
arrangement and collection of data regarding the 
preferences and behavior of students for inferring the 
learning styles and the affective states respectively from 
this data.  The two different approaches namely the data 
driven-approach and the literature-based approach are 
applied in this part. 
 
The data-driven approach, for the purpose of developing 
a model each for identifying the learning styles and the 
affective states, exploits sample data. For instance, Cha 
et al., [9] derived the learners’ patterns of behavior 
regarding each learning style dimension from the 
literature and then the data regarding the patterns were 
analyzed with DTs and HMMs. Similarly, Cocea & 
Weibelzahl [22] derived the behavioral patterns of 
learners regarding affective states from the literature and 
then the data regarding the patterns were analyzed with 
eight different data mining techniques such as Bayesian 
nets, Logistic regression etc. Viola [24] described that 
due to the possibility to track users' actions during 
navigation in the Electronic Learning Environments 
(ELEs), the data obtained are fully authentic. Therefore, 
it is recommended to use data driven approaches to 
analyze such data. Moreover, such approaches have been 
applied inside different research communities dealing 
with data mining, user modelling and intelligent tutoring 
systems, and e-learning. These communities have 
investigated data driven approaches for different 
purposes, for example, for providing adaptivity [25]. 
 
The literature-based approach uses a research literature 
as a base for developing a model each for the 
identification of the learning styles and the affective 
states. According to the literature, learners having 
specific learning style dimensions demonstrate specific 
preferences. Similarly, learners with specific affective 
states demonstrate specific behavior. The philosophy of 
the literature-based approach is to get hints about the 
learning styles of students by using their learning 
preferences, and similarly, to get hints about their 
affective states using their learning behavior. Afterwards, 
a simple rule-based mechanism is applied to the gathered 
hints. This method calculates learning styles and 
affective states from the number of corresponding 
matching hints. This simple method regarding the 
learning styles is similar to the one employed for the 
calculation of learning styles in ILS questionnaire, and 
also regarding affective states is similar to the approach 
employed for the calculation of affective states such as 
academic confidence and independence in the ACS and 
independence survey questionnaire respectively. This 
approach is advantageous because of its generality and 
applicability to the data collected from any course in the 
LMSs. 
 
The data-driven approach is developed on the basis of 
concerned 
learning 
styles 
and 
affective 
states 
questionnaire calculation and aim of the approach is to 
imitate it. On the other hand, in addition to the FSLSM 
[26], information from the literature is used as a basis for 
the literature-based approach regarding the learning 
styles; whereas, in case of literature-based approach 
regarding the affective states, only the information from 
literature is used as a base. The proposed approach for 
student modelling aims at the identification of learning 
styles and affective states on a three-item scale. Thus, the 
suggested approach regarding the calculation of learning 
styles distinguishes between an active, reflective or 
balanced learning style. Similarly, the suggested 
approach regarding calculating the affective states

distinguish between, a low, balanced, or high affective 
state level. 
 
A detailed description about the proposed approach for 
student modelling is presented in the following 
subsections. In the next subsection, an introduction 
regarding included features and patterns, the relevant 
patterns related to the each learning style dimension and 
the affective state, and the thresholds for classification of 
data, 
are 
presented. 
Subsequently, 
a 
description 
regarding the two approaches, each for inferring the 
learning styles from students’ preferences and the 
affective states from the behavior of students, is 
presented. In addition to this, a method for the 
preparation of input data is described. In the final 
subsection, an evaluation of our automatic student 
modelling based on literature based approach, is 
presented by making a comparison of the results with the 
data-driven approach. 
 
A. DETERMINING RELEVANT PREFERRED WAY 
OF LEARNING AND THE LEARNING BEHAVIOR 
The approaches for automatic student modelling aim at 
the identification of learning styles on the basis of 
preferred way of learning and affective states on the 
learning behavior in the LMSs. For making the 
approaches capable of being applied to the LMSs in 
general, it is important to identify which learning 
preferences are appropriate for the identification of 
learning style and which learning behavior properly 
demonstrates the affective states. Regarding the preferred 
way of learning and the learning behavior, the LMSs 
features and patterns selection depends upon two 
requirements.  Firstly, the relevance of patterns is 
necessary for the identification of learning styles based 
on the FSLSM [26] and affective states based on P. 
Sander & Sanders [27] (reported also by Shaukat & 
Bashir [28]) and Singh & EMBI [29] etc. The second 
requirement deals with gathering information about the 
patterns in LMS. The probability of information 
gathering for patterns should be as high as possible. This 
entails that selected features are required to be available 
and integrated in the most LMSs, the selected patterns 
are tracked by most of the LMSs, and the features are 
required to be normally used by the course developers 
and the teachers. 
 
For the purpose of accomplishing the first requirement, 
features and patterns regarding the learning styles were 
deduced from the literature reported by Felder & 
Silverman [26]. Similarly, features and patterns regarding 
affective states such as confidence, independence, effort, 
and confusion were derived from literature reported by P. 
Sander & Sanders [27], Singh & EMBI [29], Pintrich & 
DeGroot [30], Qu et al., [16] respectively. Regarding the 
second requirement, only those features and patterns 
were selected which are available and incorporated in the 
most LMSs and normally used by the course developers 
and the teachers. 
 
The following subsection provides a detailed description 
about the integrated features and patterns regarding 
learning styles and affective states. Afterwards, the next 
subsection describes how to classify the data of the 
incorporated patterns regarding learning styles and 
affective states. This classification distinguishes between 
various existences of patterns data, such as fewer visits 
or a higher stay at a specific type of learning object. The 
next 
subsections 
introduce 
the 
relevant 
patterns 
regarding the learning style dimensions and also the 
affective states respectively. 
 
1) 
FEATURES AND PATTERNS SELECTION 
For this study, commonly used features of the LMSs were 
exploited such as exercises, content objects, self-
assessment tests, discussion and peer rating forum relating 
to the content objects, discussion forum related to queries 
about 
assignments, 
examples 
illustrating 
concepts, 
assignments, outlines, and patterns dealing with the 
students' navigation behavior within the course. Similarly, 
the patterns against each feature were selected in terms of 
their generality in LMSs and with respect to their 
pertinence for the learning style dimensions and also the 
affective states.  
 
For example, patterns (content_visit) and (content_stay) 
were selected against the content objects, which describe 
the total visits and the time spent by learners over the 
contents consecutively. Table 1 describes the features and 
associated patterns exploited for the identification of 
learning styles and affective states. In the subsequent 
section, a recommendation for the classification of 
different occurrences of patterns data regarding the 
learners' learning preferences and behavior is introduced. 
Afterwards, in addition to relevant patterns regarding the 
learning style dimensions and the affective states, the 
respective occurrence of learning preferences and behavior 
are discussed. 
 
2) 
CLASSIFYING THE DIFFERENT OCCURRENCES 
OF PATTERN DATA 
This section describes the classification of different 
occurrences of patterns (introduced in the previous 
section) data regarding the learners' learning preferences 
and behavior. The uniqueness of this approach is that it is 
generic and applicable to various courses having different 
attributes. Regarding this, a three (3) item scale is 
employed, which divides each, the learning preferences 
and the behavior into 3 groups. The three groups describe 
the high, low, and moderate occurrence. This classification

employs generic threshold values instead of considering 
the average learning preferences and behavior, in a 
particular course.  Use of generic threshold values is 
advantageous because, results in the form of detected 
learning styles and affective states are not dependent over 
learning preferences and behavior of other students. On 
the other hand, using the average learning preferences and 
behavior for getting threshold values will result in a 
distribution of learning styles and affective states which is 
defined in advance for each respective pattern, and it may 
not be applicable for medium and small size groups.  
 
Therefore, generic thresholds were used to make the 
suggested approach suitable for the small and medium size 
groups. However, Alberer et al., [31] argued that general 
thresholds can vary, depending on subject, course 
structure, as well as students’ experiences. 
 
In the subsequent paragraphs, recommendations for 
thresholds from the literature (e.g. Graf et al., [12], Garcia 
et al., [32], Picciano [33], Cheng [34]) are used as a base, 
with the further consideration of the attributes of particular 
course, and are described in table 2.  
 
The thresholds of 75% and 100 % regarding visiting 
content objects were used. Content objects are initially, 
delivered verbally through the lecture in a classroom, and 
later on uploaded through LMS by the teacher or course 
designer, where the students had the opportunity to visit 
and explore the learning material. Moreover, the learning 
material can be downloaded by the students either for 
taking a print or reading it offline. The content objects are 
helpful for students, not only for the course examination 
preparation, but for other purposes as well. For example, 
for looking up information about the questions presented 
in exercises and self-assessment tests. This demonstrates 
that by viewing the pattern regarding content objects 
visits, it can be concluded that whether the students used 
the content objects for getting knowledge about certain 
topic or they looked at examples etc. Similarly, regarding 
the students’ stay at content objects i.e. students were 
expected to spend on this type of object, threshold values 
of 10% and 20 % of the predefined time estimate, were 
used. The reason behind introducing and using the low 
percentage threshold values is due to the fact that students 
had the opportunity to read the content objects online as 
well as they can download the learning material and read it 
offline.     
 
Regarding the outlines visit, threshold values of 75% and 
150 % were used. Moreover, regarding the outline stay i.e. 
the time students were expected to spend on this type of 
object, the threshold values of 50% and 75 % of the 
predefined time estimate, were used.

available exercises. Regarding the time stay at exercises, 
thresholds of 50% and 75% were used, with respect to the 
expected learning time to spend on this type of object.  
 
Regarding course overview visits, thresholds of 10% and 
20% were used in terms of total learning objects visits. 
Similarly, with regard to course overview stay i.e. total 
time students were expected to spend, thresholds of 50% 
and 75% of predefined time estimate were used. The 
thresholds regarding the visits of the self-assessment tests 
were used with 50% and 75% of the number of self-
assessment questions. For stay at self-assessment tests, 
thresholds of 50% and 75% were used, in relation to the 
expected learning time estimates of students with high 
interest in that kind of object. The thresholds regarding 
revision of the self-assessment tests were used with 25% 
and 50% of the total number of self- assessment tests. 
With respect to the performance on specific types of 
questions, thresholds of 50% and 75% were used, based 
on the number of questions that were answered correctly. 
The thresholds regarding visits of the examples were used, 
with 50% and 100% of the total number of examples that 
were available. Regarding the stay at examples, thresholds 
of 50% and 75% were used in relation to the expected 
learning time estimate of students with high interest in that 
kind of object. 
 
For discussion forums, thresholds regarding the visits of 
the assignment related forum were used with 2 and 4 for 
each individual assignment. Regarding the queries posted 
on the assignment related forum, thresholds of 1 and 2 
were used for each individual assignment. Similarly, 
regarding replies to queries posted on the forum related to 
assignments, thresholds of 1 and 2 were used for each 
individual assignment. For the discussion forum related to 
content objects, thresholds regarding visits of the forum 
were used with 2 and 4 per week. Moreover, regarding the 
posts, thresholds of 1 and 2 were considered per week. 
Similarly, 
regarding 
replies/commenting 
to 
posts, 
thresholds of 1 and 2 per week were used. For the 
assignments, thresholds regarding the number of revisions 
were set with 1 to 2 for each individual assignment. For 
stay at assignments, thresholds of 50% and 75% were used 
with respect to the expected submission time of students, 
with greater attention on that kind of learning object. 
Regarding skipping learning objects, 1% and 2% 
thresholds were used with respect to the total number of 
visited learning objects.

RELEVANT 
PATTERNS 
FOR 
IDENTIFYING 
LEARNING STYLE DIMENSIONS 
The patterns for identification of each learning style 
dimension and information regarding whether a low or 
high existence of respective patterns data is relevant, are 
presented, in this section. The research literature 
concerning the FSLSM [26] is used as a basis for the 
relevant patterns and the information about their 
occurrence. The patterns regarding active or reflective, 
sensing or intuitive, visual or verbal, and sequential or 
global dimensions are introduced in the respective 
subsections.  
 
According to FSLSM, each learning style dimension 
comprises of two opposite poles thus, when a high 
existence of respective pattern data indicates one pole of 
the dimension; a low existence of the same pattern data 
indicates opposite pole of the same dimension. Therefore, 
for the reflective, global, verbal, and intuitive dimension 
the relevant occurrences of patterns are simply opposite. 
The respective patterns indicate that the identification of 
each learning style dimension comprises of comparatively 
greater number of patterns. Considering a great number of 
patterns provides more elaborated information and is 
essential particularly for formulating an approach which 
has the capability of identifying the learning styles in the 
LMSs in general instead of in the one particular system, 
owing to the possibility that information related to some 
patterns are unavailable. Table 3 illustrates the patterns for 
each learning dimensions. 
 
a) 
a:    ACTIVE/REFLECTIVE DIMENSION 
Learners who are more active in processing information 
are categorized as active learners. In order to process the 
information, active learners usually discuss it, apply it, and 
explain it to the other. On the other hand, reflective learners 
have a great preference towards thinking about material prior 
to acting and they preferably work alone. Regarding 
discussing, participation in discussions through the 
discussion forums such as "discussion/peer rating forum" 
and "assignment forum" are used to get indications regarding 
the preference of students for active or reflective learning. 
For the purpose of discussing something, active learners are 
supposed to post a great number of times while reflective 
learners are expected to participate in a passive manner by 
reading the "assignments related forum" and the "discussion 
and peer rating forum" posts instead of posting actively in 
these forums. Therefore, the number of posts regarding the 
"discussion/peer rating forum" can be used as a pattern for 
the identification of an active or reflective learning style.  
 
In terms of applying (testing and trying things out), active 
learners are supposed to attempt a great number of 
exercises and self-assessment tests. Moreover, overall, 
active learners are expected to stay at self-assessment tests 
for less time, however, they are expected to stay at 
exercises for more time. Similarly, regarding preference of 
explaining, active learners are supposed to reply to the 
queries posted in assignment related forum. In addition, 
they are expected to comment on newly posted queries of

other students in the discussion and peer rating forum 
regarding the content objects. 
 
Reflective learners, on the other hand, have a great 
tendency towards thinking about the learning material and 
reflecting about it, therefore, they are supposed to have a 
great number of visits to the learning material such as 
content objects. Furthermore, they are expected to stay at 
outlines and content objects for a long time. Moreover, for 
the purpose of producing good results, they are expected to 
stay at exercises and self-assessment tests for a long time. 
 
  b:   SENSING/INTUITIVE DIMENSION 
Learners gravitating towards concrete material, for 
instance, facts and data are characterized as sensing 
learners. Using well-established methodologies, they 
(sensing learners) tend to solve their problems. 
Moreover, such learners are slow at working and have 
patience but cautiousness while dealing with details, and 
more often perform well when they use repetition as a 
learning tool.  Regarding learning from concrete material 
and also from existing approaches, sensing learners prefer 
examples. Thus, the total visits as well as the stay at 
examples can be used as a pattern for the identification of 
sensing or intuitive learning style. Regarding the 
preference to work cautiously but slowly, sensing learners 
are assumed to be the ones who take more time for the 
submission of exercises and self-assessment tests. With 
regard to the use of repetition as a learning tool, sensing 
learners are supposed to repeat the self-assessment test and 
are also expected to get a satisfactory score in the final 
attempt. 
 
According to FSLSM, intuitive learners, on the other 
hand, welcome challenges in learning and do not like 
details. Furthermore, they are innovative and do not like 
repetitions. 
Additionally, 
unlike 
sensing 
learners, 
intuitive learners work at a high pace. Regarding learner's 
behavior when faced with challenges, intuitive learners are 
expected to spend less time on assignments and have a 
low number of assignment revisions. Having a high 
number of content objects’ visits, spending more time; 
and having fewer examples’ visits, spending less time, 
indicates the behavior of students in terms of using 
examples exclusively as a secondary material and also 
that they are disinterested in niceties. No revision of self-
assessment tests on getting a moderate or satisfactory 
grade in the initial attempt indicates the students’ 
behavior in terms of disliking repetitions.  
 
c:    VISUAL/VERBAL DIMENSION 
Learners that learn best using graphical material such as 
images, graphics and flow charts are categorized as 
visual learners. Therefore, correctly performing a great 
number of graphical questions gives us an indication 
about the visual dimension of a learner. On the other 
hand, verbal learners are those learners which prefer input 
in the form of words, irrespective of the input being 
written or oral. 
 
Therefore, a great number of visits to and more time 
spent on content objects gives us an indication about the 
students’ verbal dimension. In addition, verbal learner 
have a great tendency to discuss and communicate with 
others. Therefore, having a high number of posting in the 
discussion forums as well as frequent replies to forum 
posts 
indicates 
students’ 
behavior 
in 
terms 
of 
verbalizing.  
 
d:    SEQUENTIAL/GLOBAL DIMENSION 
Sequential learners feel comfort while dealing with the 
details and like to be logical in problem-solving. Since 
such learners navigate through the course in a linear 
fashion, therefore, the information related to the sequential 
dimension of students can be obtained using navigation 
behavior of students. According to FSLSM, global 
learners, on the other hand, tend to get an idea/overview of 
the contents and do not go into much details. They obtain 
big picture regarding the course contents and have a high 
number of navigation skips. Therefore, frequent visits to 
course overview and chapter outlines indicate the behavior 
of students in terms of globalizing. 
 
4) 
RELEVANT PATTERNS FOR IDENTIFYING     
AFFECTIVE STATES 
This section introduces relevant patterns for the 
identification of students' affective states such as 
confidence, independence, effort, and confusion. The 
patterns and the information about their existence is based 
on the relevant research literature concerning the 
confidence [27], independence [29], effort [30]; [16]; [35], 
and confusion [16]; [36]. The patterns regarding 
confidence, independence, effort, and confusion are 
introduced in the following sub sections. Since each 
affective state consists of two opposite levels therefore, for 
one level of the affective state, indications are obtained 
using high occurrence of a specific pattern data, while for 
opposite level of the same affective state, indications are 
obtained using a low occurrence of the same pattern data. 
 
Table 4 describes a high occurrence of the relevant patterns 
data for high level of each affective state and vice versa. 
Moreover, the identification of each affective state 
comprises relatively a great number of patterns. 
Considering such a great number of patterns provides more 
elaborated information and is quite significant for the 
development of an approach with the capability of 
identifying affective states in the LMSs in general instead 
of in one particular system, owing to the unavailability of 
information with regard to some of the patterns in some

a:    CONFIDENCE 
Stankov et al., [37] highlighted the importance of academic 
confidence by describing it to be the best predictor of 
students’ achievement. Similarly, Shaukat & Bashir [28] 
conducted a study based on Paul Sander & Sanders [38] in 
order to measure the students’ academic confidence. Their 
findings indicate the different levels of academic 
confidence amongst students. In the same way, for the 
measurement of students' academic confidence, P. Sander 
& Sanders [27] conducted a study. This research study 
produced six factors namely studying, verbalizing, 
understanding, clarifying, grades, and attendance. Among 
the six factors mentioned by Sander and Sanders, we 
considered five factors for the identification of academic 
confidence. Since grades is a factor which does not 
correlate with the learning behavior of students. Therefore, 
this factor is exempted. 
 
Regarding studying, visits to the content objects, 
examples, and outlines can demonstrate the students’ 
behavior with respect to studying. Similarly, the total 
number of exercises’ and self-assessment tests’ visits, 
and as a consequence successfully attempting a great 
number of questions, indicate students’ behavior with 
regard to understanding. Regarding students behavior 
with respect to verbalizing, posting frequently over the 
discussion and peer rating forums regarding the content 
objects as well as comments on a high number of posts in 
such forums indicate students’ behavior in terms of 
verbalizing. The total number of visits to the queries 
posted in assignment related forums and also visits to 
discussion and peer rating forum posts regarding content 
objects indicate students’ behavior with respect to 
clarifying. Counting all discussion and peer rating forum 
posts regarding content-objects, comments and peer 
rating of posts, and replies to forum posts posted in the 
forums relating to queries about assignments indicate 
students’ behavior in terms of attendance. 
 
b:    INDEPENDENCE 
According to Kesten [39], independence or independent 
learning is a type of learning in which learners, with the 
help of other relevant learners, can make decisions 
essential for their own learning requirements. Many recent 
researchers, for instance, Cukurova [40], Laurillard [41] 
have accepted and used this definition of independence. 
Therefore, the definition of Kensten about independence is 
accepted for this research study. In addition, in order to 
look into students’ abilities to work independently during 
web-based learning, Singh & EMBI [29] described the 
significance of five factors namely planning, organizing, 
monitoring, evaluating, and computer abilities. Among 
five factors mentioned by Singh and Embi, we considered 
four factors for the identification of autonomous abilities.  
 
Computer abilities is a factor which has been exempted 
on the basis of an assumption that there is similarity in 
students’ abilities in terms of accessing the course 
materials as well as the related links for the 
accomplishment of different learning tasks using the 
LMSs. Planning and organizing refers to the student’s 
ability regarding the formulation of techniques and 
materials, learning objectives, and a timetable for the 
accomplishment of different learning. Therefore, visits to 
outlines, content objects, examples, and forum postings as 
well as the visits to discussion and peer rating forum posts 
regarding content objects indicate the behavior of students 
with regard to planning. Monitoring relates to the 
student’s ability for checking, verifying, and correcting 
themselves during different learning tasks. Therefore, peer 
rating of discussion and peer rating forum posts regarding 
content objects, assignment submissions, even in various 
attempts indicate the students’ behavior in terms of 
monitoring. Evaluating refers to the ability of a student

regarding judgment, evaluation, and decision making with 
respect to performance for the achievement of different 
learning tasks. Therefore, the number of attempts at the 
exercises as well as the self-assessment tests indicate the 
behavior of students with regard to evaluating. 
 
c:    EFFORT 
According to Attribution Theory, effort is not a stable 
factor, although students have a high level of control on 
it [42]. For instance, by trying hard, students can control 
their effort or students who are failing repeatedly in a 
course that is relatively tough, can succeed by registering 
to an easy one.

Students’ attribution of failure to the factors which are 
unstable, for example, luck and effort, is a preservation of 
expectations to the success in future tasks and expedites 
performance [43]. For instance, attributing failure to the 
low ability by a student, results in the expectation of 
failures in future tasks as well. Because, there is no 
immediate remedy to enhance one’s ability. Conversely, if 
students attribute their failure towards low effort, they can 
work harder in the upcoming tasks, and can gain success. 
Jiga-Boy et al., [44] also highlighted the investment of 
effort with respect to the potential success in a particular 
task. Similarly, Shanabrook et al., [45] studied the 
students’ level of effort from the log data generated 
through touch interactions with the tablet.  
 
Following the motivational theory concept Bernard Weiner 
[42], Pintrich & DeGroot [30], Qu et al., [16], and De 
Vicente [35] verified rules regarding effort, information 
regarding student's effort in LMSs is obtained with the help 
of following behavior. A great number of exercise and self-
assessment attempts indicate the students’ behavior in 
terms of exerting high effort. Moreover, a great number of 
visits to the forums as well as a high number of forum post 
replies in the discussion and peer rating indicates a high 
level of effort by student. Submitting the assignments well 
before deadline and assignment revisions in case of low 
grades in the initial submission indicates the behavior of 
student in terms of exerting high effort. 
 
d:    CONFUSION 
Arguel et al., [46] argued that confusion is an affective 
state which arises while dealing with complex learning 
material. This emotional state on the one hand, can be 
helpful since it can promote further engagement, thus 
resulting into deep understanding of the topic. On the 
other hand, if learners are not able to overcome the state of 
confusion in time, it can badly affect their learning. Such 
experiences are more concerning within web-based 
learning environments, where instructor is not physically 
present to look into the learners’ engagement. Due to this 
lacking, it becomes difficult to offer the different teaching 
strategies accordingly. Similarly, B. Lehman & Graesser 
[47] argued that the confusion can have a positive or 
negative impact. It depends on whether a learner is able to 
identify the source of confusion and also has the tendency 
to mitigate it accordingly. The resolution of confusion is 
highly significant because it can take the learner to the 
state of frustration Lehman et al., [48].  
 
Following the Arguel et al., [46], B. Lehman & Graesser 
[47], B Lehman et al., [48], Qu et al., [16] and Baker et al., 
[36], in the state of confusion, students can be divided 
into two categories 1) stuck and 2) gamer. Therefore, the 
information related to the students’ confusion in LMSs 
can be obtained using the following behavior. Solving a

low number of exercises and self-assessment tests 
indicates that the students are stuck. Furthermore, stuck 
students are those students who do not attempt most of 
the questions in the self-assessment tests as well as the 
exercises. A great number of visits to the examples as 
well as a great spending of time on each example gives 
an indication regarding stuck students. In terms of 
assignment submissions, students who post messages 
repeatedly over the discussion forums for assignment 
related queries, are considered to be the stuck students. 
Furthermore, students having a great number of 
assignment revisions are assumed to the stuck students. 
They spend much time on content objects and are 
supposed to have a great number of visits to forums for 
content objects. Moreover, students forwarding a low 
number of peer ratings regarding the content objects in 
discussion and peer rating forum are supposed to be the 
stuck students. On the other hand, misusing the available 
system is an attribute of gamer students. They tend to 
involve in gaming activities during self-assessment tests, 
for example, gamer students input answers to question 
quickly and repeatedly until they get a positive feedback. 
Information regarding students’ confusion level can be 
obtained by using these patterns of stuck and gamer 
students. 
 
B.  FROM BEHAVIOR TO LEARNING STYLES AND 
AFFECTIVE STATES 
The previous section describes relevant patterns for 
identifying learning style dimensions and affective states, 
and the classification of data related to these patterns for 
the differentiation of a high, low, or moderate existence of 
the respective patterns. The high, low or moderate 
existence of these patterns indicates a particular learning 
style preference as well as a particular affective state level. 
On the basis of this available information, data related to 
students' preferences and behavior can be used for 
calculating the hints for particular learning style 
dimension and also the particular affective state level. This 
section gives a description about the calculation of 
learning styles and affective states, beginning from the 
unrefined data related to students’ learning preferences 
and behavior in the LMS’s database.  
 
In the first step, ordered data regarding each pattern is 
calculated and arranged in a form that it can be used as 
input for both of the suggested approaches, each for the 
identification of learning styles and affective states. In the 
next subsection, an approach related to this is explained. 
Afterwards, both of the suggested approaches including 
the literature-based approach with the use of rule-base 
mechanism and the data-driven approach with the use of 
Bayesian networks, each for the identification of learning 
styles and affective states are introduced. 
 
1) 
METHOD FOR DATA PRE-PROCESSING 
Data pre-processing involves data collection, data 
cleaning, conversion of continuous data into a suitable 
shape, attribute selection, data integration, etc. The 
purpose of data pre-processing is to pre-process usage 
information of students which is gathered in the duration 
of their course usage and stored in the LMS’s database as 
well as the log files. 
 
In the first step, data about students’ learning preferences 
and behavior, as mentioned in Section III part 1 (Features 
and Pattern Selection), is required to be extracted from the 
LMSs’ database. Afterwards, on the basis of available 
information, mapping of data about students' learning 
preferences and behavior is performed on a 4-item scale. 
To be more specific, let O be the ordered data matrix 
representing rows the students and columns the available 
patterns. For the classification of each student’s 
preferences and behavior regarding each pattern, the value 
in a range of 0 to 3 is assigned, where 1, 2, and 3 represent 
a low, moderate and high occurrence respectively. The 
unavailability of information related to the respective 
pattern is specified by a zero (0).  This data mapping is 
based on the threshold values described in Section III part 2. 
 
Afterwards, the matrix LSdim was built regarding each 
learning style dimension and the matrix ASfac was   built 
regarding each affective state. The LSdim and ASfac include 
the ordered data from matrix O. Each LSdim matrix 
representing students in rows and the relevant patterns related 
to the respective learning style dimension dim in columns, as 
mentioned in Section III part 3. Similarly, each ASfac matrix 
representing students in rows and the relevant patterns for 
each affective state fac in columns, as mentioned in Section 
III part 4. In order to calculate the respective learning style 
dimension and also the respective affective state, the four 
matrices, each for the learning styles and the affective states, 
are used as input data. 
 
2) 
MINING STUDENTS' LEARNING STYLES AND 
AFFECTIVE 
STATES 
USING 
BAYESIAN 
NETWORKS (DATA DRIVEN APPROACH) 
Data mining is a process that uses one or more machine 
learning techniques such as Bayesian Networks, Neural 
Networks etc., for automatic analysis and knowledge 
extraction from the data stored in a database. Data mining 
techniques explore fundamental trends, patterns, and 
relationships concealed in the available data. (Chang & 
Chen [49] described that unexpected relationship in a 
dataset can be explored using data mining techniques, and 
declared it to be one its advantages. Moreover, Lee et al., 
[50] described that the data mining techniques can be 
classified into the two main groups namely the supervised 
and the unsupervised learning. Supervised learning deals 
with the assignment of objects to predefined classes or

categories. On the other hand, the unsupervised learning 
refers to dividing the data into groups having similar 
objects. Song et al., [51] described that for finding 
applicability of a supervised or an unsupervised learning 
technique, consideration of the known classes or categories 
is necessary. This indicates that if classes or categories are 
unknown, unsupervised learning approach should be used 
and vice versa.  
 
Since, this study aims at investigating the relationships 
between the learning styles and learning preferences of 
students as well as the affective states and learning behavior 
of students, so, there are known categories i.e. learning 
styles and affective states. Therefore, for this study, a 
supervised learning approach was adopted. 
 
The most extensively used supervised learning technique 
for extracting useful information from a dataset is 
classification [52]. Regarding the classification, one of 
the most widely used model is the Bayesian Networks 
(BNs), which is a graphical model for probability 
relationships among a set of variable (features). 
Kotsiantis [53] described that BNs’ most fascinating 
feature as opposed to other machine learning techniques 
such as neural networks and decision trees etc., is most 
probably 
the 
feasibility 
of 
considering 
previous 
information about the problem given, with respect to the 
structural connections amongst its features. Therefore, 
due to its effectives, several researchers have exploited 
BNs, 
particularly 
to 
classify 
students' 
learning 
preferences and behavior. 
 
Garcia et al., [32], for instance, used BNs for identifying 
learning styles on the basis of learning styles model 
defined by (Felder & Silverman [26]. In this regard, a 
study was conducted comprising 27 computer science 
students taking a web-based course on artificial 
intelligence. Afterwards, the results of their approach 
using BNs were compared with ILS Questionnaire, 
demonstrating the effectiveness of BNs in the prediction 
of learning styles of students with higher precision. In a 
similar manner, Graf [54] adopted a data-driven 
approach for the identification of learning styles using 
BNs and also a literature based approach for finding out 
the effectiveness of  suggested concept with the use of 
one or the other approach for the identification of 
learning styles. Furthermore, Danine [55] designed and 
developed an intelligent tutoring system that exploits 
BNs. The BNs were employed for the evaluation of 
students’ knowledge, for the perception of their 
strategies, for predicting their actions while solving a 
problem and for making a highly reliable diagnosis. 
 
BNs have been used extensively also to develop 
detectors of students' affective states. Qu et al., [16] 
presented a model for pedagogical agents to use the 
attention of learners for the detection of learners’ 
motivation 
factors 
in 
the 
interactive 
learning 
environments. In this regard, BN was employed that 
combine evidence from the learner’s interface actions 
and eye gaze, and consequently infers the focus of 
attention of a learner. After inferring the focus of 
attention, it was combined with the information’s 
inferred by the plan recognizer, about the learner’s 
activities. The purpose of this approach was to identify 
learners’ confidence level, effort, and confusion. 
Effectiveness of the model was confirmed by conducting 
an experimental study with 24 students at the University 
of California (UC). The accuracy of their model were 
reported to be 82% for confidence, 76.3% for effort, and 
76.8% for confusion. Furthermore, for the prediction of 
students’ affective states such as thinking, recalling, 
tiredness, and satisfaction during a classroom lecture, 
Abbasi et al., [56] explored the possibility of employing 
unintended hand gestures of students. They employed a 
BN model for the prediction of one, out of the four 
affective states observed in video recordings of a 
classroom lecture using five hand gestures. They 
reported that the generalization accuracy of model is 
100% over the cases in which student reported an 
affective state and 79.4% over the cases in which student 
reported no affective state. 
 
The mentioned studies indicate that BNs is a suitable 
approach and has the potential for inferring learning 
styles and affective states. In this section, therefore BNs 
was employed to analyze the results of an empirical 
study for the investigation of relationships between the 
learning styles and learning preferences of students as 
well as between students' affective states and their 
behavior in LMSs. An introduction of BNs is presented 
very briefly in the next subsection. Afterwards, BNs 
application for this study is presented in a subsection.

BAYESIAN NETWORKS AN INTRODUCTION 
Bayesian networks belong to the family of probabilistic 
graphical models, and describe the relationships between 
causes and effects. They consist of nodes and arcs. Each 
node in the graph represents a random variable, and arcs 
between the nodes represent probabilistic dependencies 
among the corresponding random variables. 
 
Moreover, BNs correspond to another graphical model 
structure known as directed acyclic graph (DAG). DAG 
consists of two sets. The two sets include the set of nodes 
and the set of directed edges. The nodes describe random 
variables and are represented as circles labelled by the 
variable names. The edges describe direct dependence 
among the variables and are represented by arrows 
between nodes. For example, an edge from node A to

node B represents a statistical dependence between the 
corresponding variables and the arrow indicates that a 
value taken by the variable B depends on the value taken 
by the variable A or in other words the variable A 
influences the variable B. Node A is then referred to as 
parent of B and, similarly, B is referred to as the child of 
A. A simple BN regarding learning styles as well as 
affective states is shown in figure 1 and 2 respectively. 
 
BN shown in figure 1 demonstrates the active/reflective 
dimension of the FSLSM. The patterns used for 
identifying the active/reflective learning style preference 
referred to as parent nodes and the preference for an 
active/reflective learning style referred to as the child 
node, influenced by all parent nodes. 
                       Figure 1. BN for Active/Reflective dimension 
 
Similarly, BN shown in figure 2 demonstrates the 
affective state such as confusion. The patterns used for 
identifying the affective state such as confusion, act as 
parent nodes and the behavior for affective state such as 
confusion is the child node, influenced by all parent 
nodes. The BN shown in figure 1 and 2 consists only of 
converging connections; however BNs can also include 
diverging, serial or a mix of these types of connections. 
 
Each node in a BN is associated with a conditional 
probability table (CPT), which quantifies the relationship 
between each respective node and its parents in the 
network (parameter learning.) For example, the CPT for 
variable 
B 
specifies 
the 
conditional 
probability 
distribution of B given its parents. The CPT is described 
mathematically by the notation (B/parent (B)) and 
specifies the probability of each possible state of the 
node given each possible combination of states of its 
parents. If a node does not have any parent then 
probabilities are not conditioned and the table consist of 
prior probabilities. 
 
 
                   Figure 2. BN for affective states such as confusion 
 
 
The task of learning a BN consists of two sub tasks such 
as the learning of the DAG structure of the network, and 
then the determination of its parameters. Probabilistic 
parameters in the form of local conditional distribution 
of a variable given its parents are encoded into a set of 
tables, one for each variable. Given the structure of the 
network and probabilistic parameters, several BN 
inference algorithms such as likelihood sampling, 
backward sampling etc, can be used for drawing 
inferences. 
 
4) 
BAYESIAN NETWORKS APPLICATION FOR THE 
CALCULATION OF LEARNING STYLES AND 
AFFECTIVE STATES 
Darwiche [57] described three main methods for generating 
BN. The first method deals with reflecting one's own 
knowledge or the knowledge of others (typically, 
perceptions about causal influences) and then capturing them 
into a BN. On the other hand, the next method is based on 
automatically synthesising the BN from some other type of 
formal knowledge. The last method deals with learning BN 
from the data. This method is usually applied for 
generating BNs, since acquiring data is cheap and also 
amount of available information growing rapidly. On the 
other hand, knowledge acquisition is an expensive 
process and often we don't have an expert. Friedman [58] 
described that learning BNs from data is a field of 
research which is growing rapidly and currently, a 
significant deal of activity can be seen in this field. 
Therefore, for this study the method that deals with 
learning BN from the data was adopted. The structure of

the BN regarding learning styles and affective states was 
deduced from literature, giving an indication about 
relevant patterns for the learning style dimensions and 
also the affective states. Based on the corresponding 
patterns, BNs were manually constructed for each 
learning style dimension and also each affective state. 
 
In the BN, parameter learning was employed for 
determining the conditional probability distribution. For 
input data regarding parameter learning, the matrix LSdim  
related to each learning styles dimension was extended 
by further inclusion of one column representing scale 
data with regard to learning style preference for each 
student. The extended matrix is known as Ddim. Similarly, 
ASfac, the corresponding matrix of each affective state 
was also extended by additional inclusion of one column 
representing the scale data about learning behavior for 
each student and the extended matrix is known as Dfac. 
The scale data approach was adopted from the ILS 
questionnaire regarding learning styles and affective 
states. For example, the strength of the learning style 
preferences in ILS questionnaire is indicated by values 
ranging from -11 to +11 in steps of 2. Since the aim of 
this student modelling approach is the identification of 
learning styles and affective states on a three-item scale, 
for instance, regarding the learning styles it distinguishes 
between an active, reflective, and balanced learning 
style. Similarly, regarding the affective states such as 
confidence; it distinguishes between low, balanced, and 
high level of confidence. Therefore, the values of ILS 
were scaled in a range of -1 and +1. Firstly, -1 specifies a 
value of ILS which is either smaller than -5 or is equal to -
5 and therefore, indicates a preference for reflective, 
global, verbal, and intuitive learning style, depending on 
the investigated learning style dimension. Secondly, the 
value 0 specifies a value of ILS ranging from -3 to +3 
and consequently, a preference for balanced learning 
style. Lastly, +1 specifies a value of ILS which is either 
greater than or equal to 5 and therefore gives an 
indication towards a preference for an active, sequential, 
visual, and sensing learning style. 
 
For parameter learning and evaluation of BN, both Ddim 
and Dfac were divided at random into four training and 
testing sets with partitions of 80, 70, 60, and 50 percent 
respectively. The training datasets were used for parameter 
learning or in other words, training aims at making 
predictions for future cases in which only the inputs to the 
network are known, and testing data set were used for 
evaluating the BN. This data division is necessary, since 
the purpose of training the network with respect to 
parameter learning, is to construct a network that can 
classify available data in a best possible way with regard to 
the reference values.  For constructing the BN and learning 
the parameters, Waikato Environment for Knowledge 
Analysis abbreviated as WEKA [59], was used. Moreover, 
a simple and very fast learning algorithm, called K2  [60] 
was used for learning BNs. 
 
5) 
A LITERATURE-BASED APPROACH FOR 
INFERRING LEARNING STYLES AND AFFECTIVE 
STATES USING A SIMPLE RULE-BASED 
METHOD 
An approach presented in the previous subsection, uses 
data for building a model to infer the learning styles and 
affective states. This section presents an approach for 
inferring learning styles and the affective states, which is 
completely derived from literature. This approach is 
developed on a concept, where each relevant pattern intro-
duced in Section III part 3 regarding learning style 
dimensions, provides a hint regarding the learning styles 
of students. On the basis of this information, and the 
information regarding whether a low or high occurrence 
of particular learning preference is supporting the 
respective learning style, the total number of matching 
hints 
can 
be 
computed, 
provided 
the 
students' 
preferences. Similarly, each relevant pattern introduced in 
Section III part 4 regarding affective states, provides a 
hint about student's affective state. This information, and 
the information regarding whether a low or high 
occurrence of particular learning behavior is indicating a 
respective affective state, the total number of matching 
hints can be computed, provided the behavior of students. 
 
The approach for calculation of hints with respect to 
learning style preferences and also the levels of 
respective affective state is founded on an approach 
developed by Graf et al., [12] for calculating learning 
styles from the behavioral patterns. Therefore, four 
values are used for denoting hints, that is, 0 to 3, where 3 
indicates that the student’s preference gives a strong 
indication 
towards 
the 
respective 
learning 
style 
dimension, and similarly, if 3 is used for affective state 
level, it gives a strong indication as well for that 
affective state. The hint value 2 gives an indication that 
the student’s preference and behavior is either average or 
balanced, and do not give a specific hint, towards the 
respective learning style dimension and affective state. 
Similarly, hint value 1 demonstrates that the student’s 
preference and behavior is in dissent with the 
corresponding learning style dimension and affective 
state. Finally, the hint value 0 demonstrate that no 
information are available. In order to classify the 
preferences and behavior of students for each pattern, 
into four values, thresholds described in Section III part 
2 are used as a basis.

A measure for the each learning style dimension and also 
the affective states are computed individually by 
summing up all the hint values initially, and then dividing it 
by the total number of the patterns giving available 
information. An equivalent mathematical notation is shown 
in formula (1), where the hint value giving available 
information for each pattern is denoted by x. The x can have 
a value ranging from 0 to 3, the total number of patterns 
giving available information is denoted by n, and a 
particular 
pattern 
number 
is 
denoted 
by 
i.  
For both the learning styles and affective states, this 
measure is normalized on a scale of 0 to 1, where 1 
indicates the strong positive preference towards a 
respective learning style and affective state. On the other 
hand, 0 indicates a strong negative preference for a 
particular learning style and affective state. However, no 
conclusion can be drawn, in case of unavailability of 
information for all patterns regarding a learning style 
dimension and affective state. 
 
IV. 
EVALUATION OF TWO APPROACHES 
The two preceding sections described the conceptual 
framework and approaches for the identification of 
learning styles and affective states from students’ 
learning preferences and behavior. This section presents 
the evaluation of suggested concept regarding automatic 
student modelling, using either a literature based or a 
data driven approach to infer the learning styles and 
affective states. 
 
The 
evaluation 
of 
proposed 
approach 
regarding 
automatic student modelling was done by tracking 
students’ learning preferences and behavior in a course 
about "Human Computer Interaction", which was offered 
through web based LMS such as Moodle. Moreover, the 
students were instructed to fill out online the ILS, ACS, 
and 
independence 
survey 
questionnaire. 
ILS 
questionnaire for the identification of students' learning 
styles, 
whereas 
ACS 
and 
independence 
survey 
questionnaire for the identification of students' affective 
states such as academic confidence and independence 
respectively. In this study, eighty one students 
participated. 
 
For tracking the data regarding students' learning 
preferences and behavior, most of the patterns based 
on certain features are either fully or partially 
supported by the LMSs. For example, the pattern 
selfassess_stay is fully supported by Moodle. Regarding 
this Moodle offers the fields starting time and closing 
time of self-assessment tests. However, to calculate the 
stay at each self-assessment test some kind of 
calculations is still needed. These kinds of calculations 
were implemented in a tool (AsLim) mentioned in the 
Section V. On the other hand, some patterns such as 
content_stay 
are partially supported by the Moodle. 
Regarding this Moodle offers a field that describe only 
the time of visit of that particular learning object and does 
not contain a field that describe the closing time of that 
object. Therefore, to calculate the stay at such kind of 
learning objects, some kind of calculation is needed. 
These kinds of calculations were also implemented in 
AsLim. 
 
The next subsection introduces the "Human Computer 
Interaction” course and its structure. The thresholds 
mentioned in Section III part 2 were maintained for the 
classification of data related to the occurrence of 
learning 
preferences 
and 
behavior, 
due 
to the 
characteristics that matches with the "Human Computer 
Interaction" course mentioned in Section IV part A. 
Afterwards, the evaluation method as well and the results 
of automatic student modelling with the use of a 
literature based and data driven approach are reported 
and discussed. 
 
A. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVESTIGATED COURSE 
For the purpose of getting data regarding the students’ 
learning preferences and behavior, a course of "Human 
Computer Interaction" is used as a basis for this study, 
which was delivered in the summer semester 2018, for 
about 10 weeks at COMSATS University Islamabad, 
Attock Campus. The course included lectures and 
assignments. The contents of the lecture were applied 
in assignments to support practical understanding of the 
material. The entire course was uploaded and managed 
through Moodle. The main purpose of using a LMS 
was to facilitate learning by presenting additional material 
and opportunities to students for learning. Moreover, the 
course also included exams. Exams were conducted into 
two parts, midterm exam and final exam. Midterm 
exam was scheduled after 4 weeks and final exam after 
9 weeks. For midterm exam the course included six 
chapters and final exam included 8 chapters. 
 
This study was conducted during the first four weeks i.e. 
before the midterm exam. The study included the course 
chapters such as 
usability 
engineering, usability 
benchmarking, 
goal 
oriented 
interaction 
design, 
prototyping, usability inspection methods, and usability 
testing methods. Moreover, the study also included the 
course features such as outlines, examples, and exercises. 
Overall, the chapters included 147 content objects. For 
all of the chapters, the outline, examples, exercises, and 
the self-assessment tests were made available. Overall, 
there were 100 questions in the self-assessment tests. 
The exercises included overall 65 questions, and were 
based on the concept that students can solve online 
exercises related to each chapter and consequently get 
feedback regarding their performance.

discussion/peer rating forum was provided for the 
course, where students' can post, reply, and view 
discussions on a specific topic for discussion. For 
examining 
the 
students’ 
knowledge, 
3 
marked 
assignments were included. Two of the assignments 
included questions which were to be answered online 
and one of the assignment answers were to be up-
loaded. Finally, the course formatting was done in 
such a way that learning everything was required by 
all the students and they were tested regarding each 
chapter content objects by a self-assessment test, 
exercise, and discussion/peer rating forum; hence the 
course had great appropriateness for investigating the 
individual learning. 
 
B. EVALUATION METHOD 
This section describes the evaluation of suggested 
concept regarding automatic student modelling, against 
the data-driven approach, in order to determine the 
suggested concept usefulness. The data gathered from the 
“Human Computer Interaction" course is used as a basis 
for this evaluation. For verifying the predicted learning 
styles and also affective states of the two approaches, the 
students were instructed to fill out online the ILS 
questionnaire for the identification of learning styles, and 
the ACS and independence survey questionnaire for 
identification of students' affective states such as 
academic confidence and independence respectively.  
 
The number of students initially willing to participate in 
the study were 125. For this study, a criteria was defined 
that contains three requirements, and data meeting those 
requirements was used as input data. Firstly, data from 
the students was not considered who either did not 
submit the concerned questionnaires online or the 
submitted questionnaires were incomplete. Secondly, 
data from only those students was considered, who 
secured out of the assignments total allotted points, at 
least 50% points, , which was required for a positive 
outcome. This was opted to exclude the data of drop out 
students. Thirdly, data from only those students was 
included who registered as well as appeared in the 
midterm exam, which was also a requirement for 
positive 
outcome. 
This 
requirement 
has 
great 
significance as it assures that students’ preparation for 
the terminal exam is incorporated in the data. Finally, for 
this study, data related to the 81 students was used. 
 
Subsequently, the two subsections describe in detail the 
evaluation of concept for automatic student modelling 
based on either of the two approaches namely the data-
driven and literature-based approach. 
 
C. EVALUATION METHOD BASED ON THE DATA 
DRIVEN APPROACH 
The use of data in certain proportion for training a model 
is the key idea of a data-driven approach. For this 
purpose the available learning preferences and behavior 
data was thus divided into the training data and test 
data respectively. For training the BN, training data-
set was used whereas for evaluating the effectiveness of 
resulting BN for the identification of learning styles and 
affective states based on students’ learning preferences 
and behavior respectively, testing data-set was used. 
Then a comparison was made between the learning 
styles predicted by the BN and the information 
regarding the learning styles identified by the ILS 
questionnaire. Similarly, the affective states such as 
confidence and independence, predicted by BN were 
then compared with the information about the affective 
states identified by the ACS and independence survey 
questionnaire respectively. Since the approach was 
developed for the identification of learning styles and the 
affective states by differentiating between three values, 
for example an active, reflective and balanced learning 
style and also low, balanced, and high affective state 
level. Therefore, both the learning styles based on 
either the values of ILS or predicted by the BN are on a 
three-item scale. Similarly, both the affective states 
reported either by the ACS and independence survey 
questionnaire or predicted by the BN are on a 3-item 
scale. 
 
For measuring the closeness of predicted learning style 
and learning style based on values of ILS, and also the 
closeness of predicted affective state and affective state 
based on either the values of ACS or independence 
survey questionnaire, the subsequent measure suggested 
by Garcia et al., [32], and also reported by Graf [54] and 
Atman et al., [61] regarding the learning styles, was used. 
 
 
 
Where LSpredicted indicate the learning style predicted 
by the BN, LSILS relates to the learning style identified by 
the ILS questionnaire, mapped to a three-item scale, and 
n denotes the total number of 
students. 
The 
comparison between the two parameters i.e., the 
learning style predicted by the BN (LSpredicted) and the 
learning style identified by the ILS questionnaire (LSILS) 
is made using the function Sim. If both the parameters 
are equal, the function returns 1, whereas if both 
parameters are opposite, the function returns 0. 
Furthermore, if the function value is 0.5, this 
demonstrate that a balanced learning style has been 
reported by one parameter, and a preference towards one 
of two poles of the learning style dimension is 
represented other parameter.

Similarly, for measuring the closeness of predicted 
affective state and the affective state based on either 
ACS or independence survey questionnaire values, the 
measure used for learning styles was adopted. 
 
 
 
Where 
 indicate the affective state predicted 
by the BN, 
 refers to the affective state identified 
by the concerned questionnaire, mapped to a three-item 
scale, and n denotes the total number of students. The 
comparison between the two parameters i.e., the 
affective state predicted by the BN (
) and 
affective state identified by the concerned questionnaire 
(ASQuest) is made using the function Sim.  If both the 
parameters i.e.  
nd 
  are equal, the 
function returns 1. If one parameter depicts a balanced 
affective state and the other parameter a behavior 
towards one of the two extreme levels of affective state, 
then the function returns 0.5. If both the parameters are 
opposite, the function returns 0. 
 
For the purpose of getting more reliable results, 4 runs 
were performed for each BN regarding the learning 
styles and affective states. 
Each run includes the 
training and the testing set with the partitions of 80 
percent, 70 percent, 60 percent, and 50 percent 
respectively. BN was built for the identification of each 
learning style dimension mentioned by FSLSM. Similarly, 
BN was also constructed for the identification of affective 
states such as confidence, and independence. For the 
respective BN, the average calculated precision of the 4 
runs was used as a result. 
 
D. EVALUATION METHOD BASED ON THE 
LITERATURE BASED APPROACH 
The model for the calculation of learning styles and 
affective states in a data driven approach is trained 
with sample data. On the other hand, model which is 
literature based, is developed without using the sample 
data. Thus, to verify literature based model, the entire 
dataset can be used.  
 
In order to make literature based model comparable to 
data-driven approach regarding each the learning styles 
and the affective states, the same measure was used. For 
example, the values of ILS questionnaire were scaled 
again to the values ranging from -1 to +1. In order to 
scale the results of literature-based approach between 0 
and 1 as described in Section 3.4, threshold values of 
0.25 and 0.75 were used. [54] is used as a basis for these 
thresholds, describing that the use of first and last quarter 
for the indication of learning style preferences for one or 
the other extreme of particular dimension and the use of 
second and third quarter for the demonstration of a 
balanced learning style produces better as well as reli-
able results than the division of range into 3 parts. 
Therefore, regarding learning styles, on the basis of 
scaled results of the literature based approach (LSpredicted) 
and scaled ILS values, the formula 2 was used and the 
results were used as a measure for literature-based 
approach. Similarly, regarding the affective states, on the 
basis of scaled results of literature-based approach 
(ASpredicted) and scaled ASQuest values, the formula 3 was 
applied. ASQuest describe either the ACS or independence 
survey questionnaire. 
 
E. EVALUATION RESULTS 
Table 5 and 6 reports the results of data driven 
approach using BNs for inferring learning styles and 
affective states respectively. The table 5 presents the 
four training and the testing set with various partitions, 
and their corresponding results. Furthermore, it describe 
the average results regarding each learning style 
dimension. The average results give an indication 
towards a moderate precision, ranging from values 
between 63.56 and 71.21.

literature-based and data-driven approach regarding the 
learning styles is presented in Table 7.  This indicates 
clearly that literature-based approach yields better 
results than data-driven approach regarding each learning 
style dimension. The results reported by the literature 
based approach indicate high precision, ranging from 
values between 74.87 and 81.25, and therefore can be 
declared as good results. A comparison of average 
results, reported by the data-driven approach and the 
literature-based approach regarding the affective states is 
presented in Table 8. The comparison indicates clearly 
that as compared to data-driven approach, literature-
based approach produces good results regarding 
affective states such as confidence and independence. 
The results reported by the literature based approach 
indicate high precision, ranging from values between 
79.05 and 82.31, and therefore can be declared as good 
results.

ASLIM – A TOOL FOR AFFECTIVE STATES 
AND LEARNING STYLES IDENTIFICATION 
AND MEASUREMENT 
AsLim stands for “Affective States and Learning Styles 
Identification and Measurement” and is developed on the 
basis of an approach for automatic identification of 
affective states and learning styles. The AsLim extends this 
approach by allowing teachers to specify the required 
information regarding learning objects more easily, and 
thus enabling them to automatically detect the affective 
states and the learning styles of their students. It is a stand-
alone tool, and based on features commonly available in 
most of the LMSs. For the identification of affective states 
and learning styles, it uses an implicit modelling 
mechanism by analyzing the interaction of students with 
web-based LMSs in the form of learning behavior and 
preferences. On the one hand, these identified affective 
states behavior and learning styles preferences provide 
teachers with more information about their students, and on 
the other hand, can act as a basis for enhancing adaptivity 
in terms of affective states and learning styles. AsLim 
implements literature-based approach for the purpose of 
inferring affective states and learning styles, since this 
approach produces better results than the data-driven 
approach. The next section describes the architecture of 
AsLim tool in more detail. Afterwards, an introduction to 
the tool is presented by displaying the necessary and the 
possible interaction of user for the ease of teachers’ use.

          Figure 4. Calculation Process 
 
Figure 3 illustrates the tool architecture. It comprises of 
two components namely the data extraction component 
and the calculation component. The data extraction 
component based on the information provided by a teacher 
or course designer extracts the patterns raw data regarding 
the learning preferences behavior and behavior from the 
database. The data extracted by the data extraction 
component is then passed on to the calculation component 
for further processing.  
 
The calculation component, initially refines the raw data 
associated with each pattern and then calculates the 
Affective states (AS) and Learning styles (LS) of each 
student. The results obtained are then visible to a teacher. 
The figure 4 gives a detailed overview of the calculation 
process (already described in section III part D) followed 
by the AsLim. 
 
B. ASLIM AND USER INTERACTION 
This section presents a brief description of AsLim’s 
features in relation to user interaction. After logging-in, a 
course selection page is displayed to the user, a page where 
teacher can select a single or multiple courses in which 
he/she wants to identify students’ learning styles and 
affective states. The next step deals with configuration of 
thresholds for the expected stay at learning objects. 
 
In this step, the teacher determines how much time a 
student should spent on content objects, outlines, course 
overviews and examples as shown in figure 6. Since the 
expected stay for self-assessment tests and exercises is 
required at the time of its creation of an exercise and self-
assessment test and this time is stored in the Moodle 
database, therefore, AsLim directly retrieves this time 
estimate from Moodle database rather than getting the time 
as input from the teacher.

Following this step, the teacher is required to configure 
threshold values for visits and stay (mentioned in section 
III part 2) for different learning objects as illustrated in 
figure 7. After this, the teacher selects one of the two 
actions which are “calculate learning styles” and 
“calculate affective states”. In the final step, results are 
displayed to the teacher about the learning styles and 
affective states of his/her students. 
 
VI. 
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented automatic approach of 
student modelling, for the identification of learning 
styles based on FSLSM, and the affective states based on 
the literature reported by (P. Sander & Sanders [27], 
Singh & EMBI [29], Pintrich & DeGroot [30], and Qu et 
al., [16]. In this regard, a simple rule based mechanism is 
applied, assuming that preferences and behavioral 
patterns can provide relevant hints for the identification 
of students’ learning styles and affective states. The 
basic idea of this approach is very similar to that of the 
questionnaire approaches, except that, this approach 
exploits preferences and behavioral data implicitly, 
instead of asking students about their preferences and 
behavior explicitly. Furthermore, our approach is 
applicable to most of the LMSs due to its generic nature. 
 
The proposed approach regarding learning styles was 
evaluated by comparing the results with the data driven 
approach using BN, and also with the two recent studies 
reported by [6] and [62]. They reported consecutively, 
the results of 70 % and 65% for the active/reflective 
dimension. Similarly, for the sensing/intuitive dimension 
results with an accuracy of 66% and 75% were reported. 
Regarding the visual/verbal dimension, marginally 
higher results (75% and 76.25%) were reported. For 
sequential/global dimension results of 80% and 77.5% 
were achieved. Comparison of results reported by the 
two studies with those of our results, demonstrate that 
our approach yields high precise results for the 
active/reflective, sensing/intuitive, and visual/verbal 
dimensions, whereas, for the sequential/global dimension 
our results are slightly lower.  
 
With regards to the results of affective states’ 
identification through behavioral patterns, there is no 
such study reported in literature (to the best of our 
knowledge) which demonstrates the results. However, by 
comparing the results of two approaches i.e. data-driven 
and literature-based that we have exploited, it can be 
seen that the literature-based approach produces good 
results for affective states such as confidence and 
independence. Regarding confidence and independence, 
literature-based approach achieved the results of 82.31% 
and 79.05% respectively, whereas the results of data-
driven approach were significantly lower which 
accounted for 67.86% and 73.92% for confidence and 
independence respectively. Owing to the unavailability 
of concerned questionnaires, the results of literature-
based approach regarding confusion and effort cannot be 
reported. However, from the reported results tendency of 
literature based approach as compared to the data driven 
approach, it can be concluded that the literature based 
approach regarding the affective states namely the 
confusion and effort may also demonstrate a high 
precision.  
The evaluation of the suggested approach showed 
promising results, demonstrating that the approach is 
appropriate for the identification of learning styles and 
affective states. Therefore, the proposed approach is 
implemented by developing a learning styles and affective 
states identification and measurement tool (AsLim), thus 
making the teachers capable to know about their students 
preferences and behavior.  
 
There are some limitations to generalizability of the 
results of our studies. Firstly, participants of the studies 
were limited to only COMSATS University Islamabad, 
Attock Campus, studying a course “Human Computer 
Interaction (HCI)”. Therefore it might be interesting to 
confirm our results with university students from other 
countries and cultures. Secondly, for the convenience of 
collecting data, results of the studies reported are based 
on HCI course, so it might also be interesting to confirm 
our results in a course other than HCI. Thirdly, all the 
participants of our studies were from the university due 
to the fact that universities are major target groups of 
using LMSs, so it would be interesting to confirm our 
results with non-university students. 
 
In the following paragraphs, possible future researches 
that can be carried out based on the presented research, 
are discussed in more detail. 
 
Regarding the identification of learning styles and 
affective states, this research proposed a static student 
modelling approach. This approach first gathers students' 
preferences and behavioral data over a period of time and 
then used that data to calculate learning styles and 
affective states. On the other hand, dynamic student 
modelling approach processes the students' preferences 
and behavioral data immediately, consequently updating 
the student model. This frequent update identifies 
transition in learning styles as well as in the affective 
states, if exist. Specifically, the affective states are not 
static but it changes over time as a result of the changing 
learning environment and the particular interpretation of 
the situation by each student. Therefore, research 
reported can be seen as the basis for the development of 
an accurate real-time assessment of student learning 
styles and affective states. AsLim, a tool for the

identification of learning styles and affective states can 
be extended by introducing a dynamic student modelling 
approach as well.  
 
Future studies can focus, more specifically with 
incorporating the information about the relationship 
between learning styles and affective states into the iden-
tification process of learning styles and affective states. 
Moreover, future studies can also focus on the 
identification of the learning style dimensions and the 
affective states that contribute more towards students' 
learning gains. 
 
Another direction of the future research is to provide 
adaptivity in LMSs, based on the identified learning 
styles and affective states. This will involve different 
learning style and affective state strategies, and the tailor 
instructional design in order to improve students' 
learning performance. Appropriate and feasible, learning 
styles and affective states based strategies need to be 
developed for different target groups. Moreover, 
facilitating teachers to define which types of learning ob-
jects they want to include in the adaptation process as 
well as defining respective adaptation features. This will 
enable teachers to adjust the adaptation mechanism to 
their courses rather than the other way around. 
Moreover, to get aware and knowing students about their 
own learning styles and affective states, and helping 
them to understand their weaknesses and strengths in a 
better way during the process of learning, the future 
work is also aimed at developing an approach of open 
learner modeling.
