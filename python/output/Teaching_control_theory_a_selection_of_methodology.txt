Abstract 
This research results from the need to establish a connection between educational methodologies and students’ learning styles so that 
students can understand concepts with a high level of abstraction, such as control concepts. For this, definitions for learning, learning styles 
and active educational methodology from an engineering perspective were proposed. Then, a review of the literature on the use of learning 
styles in engineering, specifically in the area of systems control, is also presented. Finally, a methodology with a laboratory approach, 
integrating active methodologies and a learning style model, to teach control concepts was proposed. 
 
Keywords: active methodology; control systems; engineering education; learning styles.

1. Introduction 
 
Currently, there are several educational methodologies, 
which are transformed according to the job skills in each 
profession, to teach in any subject. For example, the training 
of 
professionals 
in 
engineering 
careers 
requires 
methodologies that combine the teaching of theoretical 
concepts and practical skills [1-4]. Specifically, the topic of 
dynamic system control has a high level of abstraction, which 
complicates the understanding of concepts by students 
because of the diversity of the mathematical content, such as 
the Laplace transform, differential equations, and complex

numbers, that are used to explain the concepts. Therefore, in 
this case, it is necessary to implement methodologies that 
combine theory and practice in order to facilitate correct 
understanding by students [5-7].  
In addition, it is necessary for students to acquire not only 
technical skills but also soft skills in their training process. 
These skills, such as the skills to work in multidisciplinary 
teams, to communicate effectively, to understand the ethical 
implications of their professional performance and to develop 
long-term self-learning capacities, among others, will enable 
students to integrally practice their professions. Therefore, it 
is necessary to use teaching methodologies that facilitate the 
acquisition of human and technical skills for students [8-10].

For this reason, an adequate educational methodology 
with a theoretical-practical approach, which allows students 
to consolidate theoretical knowledge and acquire skills to 
apply their knowledge in the real world, must be proposed 
[11]. In addition, human beings have different ways of 
learning, as stated by Kolb, Felder and Silverman [12,13]. 
Then, professors must establish a connection between 
educational methodologies and the different learning styles 
of students so that everyone can understand the concepts and 
develop soft skills. 
Based on the above, the following question was asked: 
What learning styles are used in dynamic system control? 
This question was addressed using a large literature review 
of approximately two hundred studies that were classified 
in order to identify only the studies in the control area. The 
eight studies selected employ the following active 
educational methodologies: learning by doing, problem-
based learning, project-based learning, collaborative 
learning, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering 
and Mathematics) [7,14-20]. In summary, the previous 
bibliographic review concluded on the importance of 
updating the didactic and methodological strategies for 
teaching control theory due to its high level of abstraction 
and suggested establishing a relationship with the learning 
styles of students in order to effectively connect the theory 
with practice and to improve the understanding of control 
concepts. However, there is currently no review on how to 
relate learning styles with active methodologies for 
engineering education that allows improving the teaching 
of control concepts. 
Therefore, the present work addresses the selection of 
methodologies that integrate a learning style model and active 
methodology to improve the understanding of basic control 
concepts under a laboratory practice approach. In summary, the 
objective of this article is to demonstrate the use of learning 
styles in the area of control engineering and propose the 
construction of a methodology for teaching control theory. 
This article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the 
definition of the concept of learning. Section 3 presents the 
definition of active educational methodology and a literature 
review of the methodologies used in the control area. In 
Section 4, three learning style models are detailed: the Kolb 
model, the Felder and Silverman model, and the VARK 
(Visual, Auditory, Reading, Kinesthetic) model. In addition, 
the use of these models in the area of system control is 
explained. Section 5 presents the relationship between 
control concepts and laboratory control objectives using the 
learning styles of Felder and Silverman. Section 6 proposes a 
methodology 
based 
on 
three 
active 
educational 
methodologies and the Felder and Silverman learning style 
model to improve the teaching of control concepts. Finally, 
in Section 7, the conclusions are presented. 
 
2. Learning concept in engineering education 
 
First, it is necessary to define learning. The concept of 
learning is difficult to define because it is abstract. However, 
there are several theories and authors that explain it from 
different perspectives. As described in [21], there is no exact 
definition of learning, even in specialized books on the 
subject. Although learning is defined as "acquiring 
knowledge of something through study or experience" 
according to the Royal Spanish Academy [22], this definition 
falls short according to the specific needs of engineering 
training and generating a didactic strategy. Thus, it is 
necessary to understand learning concept from an 
engineering perspective.  
For that, it is necessary to consider some aspects: 
• What is the most relevant information? 
• How is the information given? 
• What is the best alternative to connect theory with the real 
world? 
Hence, in [23] presented three definitions of learning 
from three psychopedagogical paradigms: behaviorism, 
cognitivism and constructivism. For behaviorism, learning is 
a change in behavior in the face of environmental stimuli; for 
cognitivism, learning is a change in mental processes when a 
link is established between the new knowledge and the prior 
knowledge of the individual; and for constructivism learning, 
learning means building lifelong knowledge over time from 
the development of social and cognitive skills. 
However, in [24] learning is defined as “the process of 
acquiring a relatively long-lasting disposition to change 
perception or behavior as a result of an experience”. In [25] 
learning is defined as "a relatively permanent change in 
behavior generated by experience". In [12] learning is a two-
step process that involves receiving and processing 
information. Therefore, the definition of learning has 
changed in accordance with the psychopedagogical trends 
and the needs of society. Thus, the definition of the Royal 
Spanish Academy is the most recent according to the 
literature analyzed. 
Based on the definitions found in the literature and in 
accordance with the purposes of this work, a definition of 
learning is structured from a didactic approach framed in 
engineering education. Thus, learning is a process that 
consists of acquiring, processing, understanding and 
applying new information in a given context. 
 
3. Active methodology to teach control systems 
 
After learning concept was defined, it was necessary to 
define an active methodology. There are different 
educational methodologies for engineering education that 
have been used to improve the learning process. 
An analysis of the methodologies that are used in engineering 
education is presented in [3]. According to the authors, it is not 
pertinent to use a single teaching method because engineers need 
to not only learn theory but also develop their practical and social 
skills. Thus, it is necessary to establish an educational 
methodology to link a methodology with the learning process. 
This is possible through active methodologies because they are 
alternatives to solve the current requirements of our society, for 
example leadership, critical thinking and adaptability, such as 
those analyzed in [1].  
Then, what is an active methodology? According to the 
literature review conducted by [1], active methodologies are 
any instructional method that involves students in the 
learning process. Therefore, active methodologies are 
characterized 
by 
constant 
student 
intervention;

hence, they are fundamental in engineers’ education. 
Furthermore, authors agree that more than one educational 
methodology should be used for engineering education to ensure 
that students acquire both the technical and human competencies 
required by an engineer today [1,3,8-10]. 
Among the active methodologies, the most prominent in 
the area of system control are project-based learning, 
problem-based learning, learning by doing, collaborative 
learning and STEM according to [7,15-20]. The benefits 
associated with these five active methodologies are presented 
in Table 1 according to [23,26-43].  
 
4. Learning styles in control engineering 
 
Once the learning concept is defined and what are the most 
common active methodologies in the area of control systems 
are identified, it is necessary to define learning styles. 
There are different models and definitions of learning 
styles, such as those in [12,13,44-49]. Learning styles are the 
cognitive, affective and physiological traits that serve as 
indicators of the way in which individuals perceive, interact 
and respond to their learning environments [44]. [13] defines 
that learning styles are individual differences in learning 
based on a student's preference for using various phases of 
the learning cycle. And [49] establishes that learning styles 
are the methods that a person uses to learn and study. 
Based on these definitions, the following definition of 
learning styles was structured from a didactic and 
engineering 
education 
perspective: 
an 
individual's 
preferences regarding the way in which person acquires, 
processes, understands and retains information. 
With the definition of learning styles, it is necessary to 
find what learning style models are the most appropriate for 
system control. Therefore, the 26 learning style models 
described in [48] were analyzed, and a literature search was 
conducted with one criterion: the model must be used in 
control engineering. As a result, three learning style models 
are selected according to [7,14-20]: the Kolb model, the 
Felder and Silverman model, and the VARK model.

4.1 Kolb model 
 
Based on the experiential learning theory in [13,50], Kolb 
conceives learning as a four-stage process: concrete experience, 
abstract conceptualization, active experimentation and reflective 
observation. Kolb establishes four learning styles from the 
combinations of the learning cycle: diverging style, assimilating style, 
converging style and accommodating style. 
So, Table 2 was generated by relating the needs of each Kolb’s 
learning styles, the activities required for each learning style and an 
active methodology that fits with both. 
 
4.2 VARK model 
 
This model is based on the neurolinguistic programming model of 
Bandler and Grinder [45], which considers three major systems for mentally 
representing information: visual, auditory and kinesthetic. However, 
Fleming & Mills add one more system to de Bandler and Grinder model: 
the reading-writing system. Therefore, this VARK model consists of four 
learning styles: visual, auditory, reading and kinesthetic [46]. 
This learning style model focuses mainly on how a student 
receives information; thus, it is possible to establish a relationship 
between the sensory modality of the human body and the VARK 
learning styles. For sight is the visual style, hearing is the auditory 
style, motor skills are kinesthetic style, and sight with motor skills 
are reading style. Table 3 shows the activities and the most 
appropriate active methodologies for each VARK’s learning style

4.3 Felder and Silverman model 
 
Based on Kolb’s model, Felder and Silverman provide a 
vision of how students learn and how to generate material to 
easily reach each type of student in [12]. This model has four 
dimensions for learning: perception, input, processing, and 
understanding. For each dimension, two opposite categories, 
such as active and reflective, was established; thus, in this 
model, there are eight learning styles: 
Perception dimension: 
• Sensitive: Sensitive people are people who prefer to 
observe. They like practical work and activities oriented 
toward facts and procedures. 
• Intuitive: Intuitive people are conceptual people oriented 
toward theories and demonstrations. 
• Processing dimension: 
• Reflective: Reflective people are analytical and reflective 
people; therefore, they require spaces to think and 
meditate. 
• Active: Active people are people who need to apply, 
experiment on and conduct practical activities. 
Input dimension: 
• Visual: Visual people are people who better 
remember what they see. They prefer figures or 
demonstrations. 
• Verbal: Verbal people are people who prefer to receive 
information verbally or in writing. 
Understanding dimension: 
• Sequential: Sequential people are people who learn 
incrementally. 
• Global: Global people are people with a comprehensive 
vision of things. 
Additionally, four dimensions directly related to the 
learning dimensions, which are content, presentation, 
student participation and perspective, are established 
for teaching. Thus, there are two opposite styles for 
each teaching dimension, resulting in eight teaching 
styles. In Fig. 1, the relationship between the 
dimensions of learning and teaching is shown 
according to [12]. 
Considering the learning styles of Felder and Silverman, 
their activities and methodologies were analyzed according 
to the needs of the eight learning styles, as described in Table 
4.

Tables 2, 3 and 4 can be used in the design of teaching 
resources that integrate the learning style models since they 
facilitate the identification of the methodologies and 
activities that impact the learning styles of each model. Thus, 
professors can first select the learning style model and then 
generate teaching resources according to the activities 
established for each learning style. 
 
4.4 Selection of learning styles to teach control systems 
 
From the specific search on the use of learning styles in 
the area of control engineering, eight works that are described 
in Table 5 were found. Some investigations do not have 
feedback from students, as in [16-18]. In [18], only partial 
results are presented; [16,19-20] focus only on simulation 
and in theory; and [7] focuses only on the practical 
component. Conversely, only [14] shows the distribution of 
their students' learning styles. 
In Table 5, the use of four learning style models, 
including the Kolb learning style, Felder and Silverman 
learning style, Gardner multiple intelligences style and 
VARK learning style, are shown.

Given that the objective of this work is to find a learning 
style model that allows proposing an educational 
methodology for the teaching of control theory, Gardner's 
multiple intelligences model cannot be framed for the 
teaching of control concepts since it is not possible to address 
all the model’s learning styles, especially musical, 
intrapersonal, naturalistic and interpersonal intelligences. 
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the other 
learning style models are analyzed. Applications of the Kolb 
model in teaching, such as those presented in [7,14-16], are 
found in the bibliography. In addition, as evidenced in Fig. 1, 
the Felder and Silverman model includes dimensions 
associated with the didactic field and a correspondence 
between learning style and teaching style. This allows the 
Felder and Silverman model to have more direct applications 
as an educational methodology, although thus far it has not 
been used as widely as the Kolb model. However, it is 
possible to compare both models and conclude that the Felder 
and Silverman model includes the dimensions proposed in 
the Kolb model.  
Additionally, comparing the Felder and Silverman model 
with the VARK model shows that the VARK model focuses 
on a single dimension of the Felder and Silverman model: the 
input. There is also a disadvantage in the Kolb and VARK 
models that their tests are not free. 
Therefore, the model that has both a cognitive and a 
didactic perspective is the Felder and Silverman model, 
which facilitates not only the design of activities but also the 
structuring of an educational methodology by having a direct 
relationship with the way it should be taught. 
Hence, the learning styles model of Felder and Silverman 
is selected as the appropriate model for the objectives of this 
work. 
 
5. Selection of the main control concepts 
 
One of the main challenges in teaching automatic control 
is to provide an adequate balance between theory and 
practice. Theory requires a high level of abstraction on the 
part of students due to a large amount of required 
mathematical background, which makes it difficult to 
understand the concepts, creating a need to implement 
different teaching strategies and tools, such as simulations 
and experimental laboratories, that allow these concepts to be 
consolidated [51-53]. 
Although this work is focused on teaching the theory and 
practice of concepts of control systems, it is necessary to 
restrict the concepts to a limited number of concepts since the 
topics of dynamic systems control are too broad to be covered 
in a single study. To do this, the choice will be limited to the 
basic concepts of control theory. 
Two factors were considered to select the control 
concepts for this work: a review of the literature and a review 
of the topics in the Input–Output Control subject of the 
Universidad Nacional de Colombia. 
Starting from the literature search, which was limited to 
the basic concepts of control [7,11,21,51,54-57] are 
condensed into 11 control concepts, considering the concepts 
taught in the Input–Output Control subject.

Considering the learning styles model of Felder and 
Silverman, relationships were established between the most 
important control concepts and the learning style. To address 
each topic, Table 4, Fig. 1, and the activities that are proposed 
throughout the Input–Output Control subject were considered, 
resulting in the relationships presented in Table 6. 
Table 6 shows that the topics of control theory are 
beneficial to students who have visual, intuitive and 
reflective styles. This makes it difficult for students with 
other predominant learning styles to understand the concepts, 
especially those who learn naturally through active 
experiences, which agrees with [5,7]. Additionally, it is 
important to mention that the verbal style is present in all 
sessions since listening to a teacher's explanations and 
reading guiding material is necessary for this type of style. 
For this reason, an adequate educational methodology 
with a theoretical-practical approach that can allow students 
to consolidate theoretical knowledge and acquire skills to 
implement the different techniques in the real world must be 
proposed. 
To accomplish this, there are some tools that improve the 
appropriation of concepts by students, such as simulation and 
experimental practices in laboratories. Laboratories play an 
important role in engineering training since it is through 
practical experiences that students connect theory with the 
real world. Therefore, institutions such as ABET have 
proposed the inclusion of engineering laboratories in their 
criteria, which is also in agreement with what was described 
by Felder and other authors [2,8,9,58-59]. Thus, the 
connection between theory and practice using a working 
method, the laboratory, is necessary for teaching control 
issues by having a working method. 
Table 7 shows the relationship of the Felder and 
Silverman learning styles with the first six learning 
objectives for a control laboratory presented by [11].  
This relationship is established considering the activities 
outlined in Table 4 and Fig. 1 for each learning style. 
From Table 7, it is evident that the students who would 
benefit from a laboratory in the control area are those with an 
active, global, sequential, and sensitive learning style. Now, 
comparing Tables 6 and 7 shows that the practical part 
complements learning styles that are not covered in the 
theoretical part, thus covering the eight learning styles 
proposed in the Felder and Silverman model. 
Considering this analysis, there is a need to establish a 
methodology more in line with the other learning styles that 
allows the design of activities to teach the control concepts, 
considering the limitations of each concept. 
 
6. Proposed methodology 
 
Considering the conclusion of the previous section, the 
most appropriate option to meet these needs is a mix of active 
methodologies. 
Due to the inclusion of the practical part of control 
concepts, it is necessary to select an active methodology that 
adapts easily to the teaching environment in the control 
laboratory. Regarding the educational methodologies used in 
the control area, in [7,15-20], the use of learning by doing, 
project-based learning, collaborative learning and STEM 
methodologies are illustrated. In this case, the STEM 
methodology is discarded as it is a methodology focused on 
K-12 education, and it is supported by learning by doing 
methodology; thus, the other three active educational 
methodologies are selected. 
These three methodologies, learning by doing, project-
based learning and collaborative learning, are appropriate for 
generating teaching material in a laboratory environment, as 
seen in [21,60-66]. In addition, although problem-based 
learning contains elements of collaborative learning, each 
concept was considered separately since this method allows 
for greater flexibility when preparing teaching materials for 
each particular concept, thus having the possibility of 
elaborating the material with one, two or all three 
methodologies as required. 
For the selected educational methodologies, an analysis 
was based on the dimensions for teaching presented by Felder 
and Silverman according to the learning styles, as presented 
in Fig. 1, and the activities associated with each style 
described in Table 4 was conducted. The result of this 
analysis is shown in Fig. 2, which represents the relationships 
between the selected educational methodologies and the 
Felder and Silverman learning styles model. 
The learning by doing methodology focuses on activities 
in which a student is the main actor and encourages self-
learning through clear instructions for the student to conduct 
activities that can strengthen the concepts to be learned. This 
type of educational methodology is considered pertinent for 
sensitive, visual, active, and sequential learning styles. 
Conversely, the problem-based learning methodology 
focuses more on problem solving. One of its main activities 
is the case study, allowing the student to analyze the problem 
and generate solutions. Therefore, the activities within this 
methodology are suitable for sensitive, intuitive, reflective 
and global learning styles. 
The collaborative learning methodology allows for 
communication between students, teamwork, developing 
communication and reflection skills, which is ideal for active, 
verbal and global learning styles. 
Therefore, the combined use of these three educational 
methodologies, 
combining 
theoretical 
classes 
with 
laboratories, will allow for the generation of activities that 
impact the eight learning styles of the Felder and Silverman

model. Laboratory practices favor the connection between 
theory and practice, that is, the association of concepts with 
a real case study, such as laboratory plants, allowing students 
to directly appropriate and apply the theoretical concepts that 
were taught in a lecture. 
 
7. Conclusions 
 
In this work, the inclusion of learning styles as a central 
component in designing a methodology to teach control 
theory and practice was addressed. To accomplish this, it was 
necessary to analyze how students learn in order to facilitate 
the acquisition of skills related to being and doing for 
students. 
The definitions of learning, learning styles and active 
methodology were adapted with the aim of applying them to 
research in engineering education under a didactic approach. 
These definitions can be used in any type of engineering. 
The specific characteristics of each learning style model 
were detailed, and then matrices in which the activities and 
methodology were presented according to the learning styles 
of each model were constructed. These tables can be used in 
the design of teaching resources in any engineering context 
as they facilitate the identification of activities that impact the 
different styles of each learning style model. Therefore, 
professors can select a learning style model and teaching 
resources to use according to the activities for each learning 
style. 
In this work, the Felder and Silverman model was 
selected considering the practical considerations, advantages 
and disadvantages of each learning style model presented. 
This model includes dimensions associated with the didactic 
field and a correspondence between learning style and 
teaching style, which facilitated its direct application for the 
design of a methodology for teaching not only control system 
theory but also any engineering subject. 
Finally, it is concluded that the proposed methodology is 
relevant for the teaching of control concepts and is a novel 
tool to address control systems topics considering the 
learning styles of the students.
