MORE ADVANCE NOISE FOR QUIET
“An intriguing and potentially life-
altering examination of the human
psyche that is sure to benefit both
introverts and extroverts alike.”
—Kirkus Reviews (starred review)
“Gentle is powerful … Solitude is so-
cially
productive … These
important
counterintuitive ideas are among the
many reasons to take Quiet to a quiet
corner
and
absorb
its
brilliant,
thought-provoking message.”
—ROSABETH MOSS KANTER, profess-
or at Harvard Business School, author
of Confidence and SuperCorp
“An
informative,
well-researched
book on the power of quietness and the
virtues of having a rich inner life. It dis-
pels the myth that you have to be ex-
troverted to be happy and successful.”
—JUDITH ORLOFF, M.D., author of
Emotional Freedom
“In
this
engaging
and
beautifully
written book, Susan Cain makes a
powerful case for the wisdom of intro-
spection. She also warns us ably about
the downside to our culture’s noisiness,
including all that it risks drowning out.
Above the din, Susan’s own voice re-
mains
a
compelling
pres-
ence—thoughtful,
generous,
calm,
and eloquent. Quiet deserves a very
large readership.”
—CHRISTOPHER LANE, author of Shy-
ness: How Normal Behavior Became a
Sickness
3/929
“Susan Cain’s quest to understand intro-
version, a beautifully wrought jour-
ney from the lab bench to the motiv-
ational speaker’s hall, offers convin-
cing evidence for valuing substance
over style, steak over sizzle, and qualit-
ies that are, in America, often derided.
This book is brilliant, profound, full
of
feeling
and
brimming
with
insights.”
—SHERI FINK, M.D., author of War
Hospital
“Brilliant,
illuminating,
empower-
ing! Quiet gives not only a voice, but a
path
to
homecoming
for
so
many
who’ve walked through the better part
of their lives thinking the way they en-
gage with the world is something in
need of fixing.”
4/929
—JONATHAN FIELDS, author of Uncer-
tainty: Turning Fear and Doubt into Fuel
for Brilliance
“Once in a blue moon, a book comes
along that gives us startling new in-
sights. Quiet is that book: it’s part page-
turner, part cutting-edge science. The
implications for business are especially
valuable: Quiet offers tips on how intro-
verts can lead effectively, give winning
speeches, avoid burnout, and choose
the right roles. This charming, grace-
fully written, thoroughly researched
book is simply masterful.”
—ADAM M. GRANT, PH.D., associate
professor of management, the Wharton
School of Business
5/929
STILL MORE ADVANCE NOISE FOR
QUIET
“Shatters misconceptions … Cain con-
sistently holds the reader’s interest by
presenting individual profiles … and re-
porting on the latest studies. Her dili-
gence, research, and passion for this
important topic has richly paid off.”
—Publishers Weekly
“Quiet elevates the conversation about
introverts in our outwardly oriented so-
ciety to new heights. I think that
many introverts will discover that,
even though they didn’t know it,
they have been waiting for this book
all their lives.”
—ADAM S. MCHUGH, author of Intro-
verts in the Church
6/929
“Susan Cain’s Quiet is wonderfully in-
formative about the culture of the ex-
travert ideal and the psychology of a
sensitive temperament, and she is help-
fully perceptive about how introverts
can make the most of their personality
preferences in all aspects of life. Soci-
ety needs introverts, so everyone can
benefit from the insights in this im-
portant book.”
—JONATHAN M. CHEEK, professor of
psychology at Wellesley College, co-ed-
itor of Shyness: Perspectives on Research
and Treatment
“A brilliant, important, and person-
ally affecting book. Cain shows that,
for all its virtue, America’s Extrovert
Ideal takes up way too much oxygen.
Cain herself is the perfect person to
make this case—with winning grace
and clarity she shows us what it
7/929
looks
like
to
think
outside
the
group.”
—CHRISTINE KENNEALLY, author of
The First Word
“What
Susan
Cain
understands—and
readers of this fascinating volume will
soon appreciate—is something that psy-
chology and our fast-moving and fast-
talking society have been all too slow
to realize: Not only is there really
nothing wrong with being quiet, re-
flective, shy, and introverted, but
there are distinct advantages to be-
ing this way.
—JAY BELSKY, Robert M. and Natalie
Reid Dorn Professor, Human and Com-
munity Development, University of
California, Davis
“Author Susan Cain exemplifies her
own quiet power in this exquisitely
8/929
written and highly readable page-
turner. She brings important research
and the introvert experience.”
—JENNIFER B. KAHNWEILER, PH.D.,
author of The Introverted Leader
“Several aspects of Quiet are remark-
able. First, it is well informed by the re-
search literature but not held captive
by it. Second, it is exceptionally well
written, and ‘reader friendly.’ Third,
it is insightful. I am sure many people
wonder why brash, impulsive behavior
seems to be rewarded, whereas reflect-
ive, thoughtful behavior is overlooked.
This book goes beyond such superficial
impressions
to
a
more
penetrating
analysis.”
—WILLIAM GRAZIANO, professor, De-
partment of Psychological Sciences,
Purdue University

To my childhood family
A species in which everyone was General
Patton would not succeed, any more than
would a race in which everyone was Vin-
cent van Gogh. I prefer to think that the
planet needs athletes, philosophers, sex
symbols, painters, scientists; it needs the
warmhearted, the hardhearted, the cold-
hearted, and the weakhearted. It needs
those who can devote their lives to study-
ing how many droplets of water are
secreted by the salivary glands of dogs un-
der which circumstances, and it needs
those who can capture the passing impres-
sion of cherry blossoms in a fourteen-syl-
lable poem or devote twenty-five pages to
the dissection of a small boy’s feelings as
he lies in bed in the dark waiting for his
mother to kiss him goodnight.… Indeed
the
presence
of
outstanding
strengths
presupposes that energy needed in other
areas has been channeled away from
them.

Author’s Note
I have been working on this book offi-
cially since 2005, and unofficially for
my entire adult life. I have spoken and
written
to
hundreds,
perhaps
thou-
sands,
of
people
about
the
topics
covered inside, and have read as many
books,
scholarly
papers,
magazine
articles,
chat-room
discussions,
and
blog posts. Some of these I mention in
the book; others informed almost every
sentence I wrote. Quiet stands on many
shoulders, especially the scholars and
researchers whose work taught me so
much. In a perfect world, I would have
named every one of my sources, ment-
ors, and interviewees. But for the sake
of readability, some names appear only
in the Notes or Acknowledgments.
For similar reasons, I did not use el-
lipses or brackets in certain quotations
but made sure that the extra or missing
words did not change the speaker’s or
writer’s meaning. If you would like to
quote these written sources from the
original, the citations directing you to
the full quotations appear in the Notes.
I’ve changed the names and identify-
ing details of some of the people whose
stories I tell, and in the stories of my
own work as a lawyer and consultant.
To protect the privacy of the parti-
cipants in Charles di Cagno’s public
speaking workshop, who did not plan
to be included in a book when they
signed up for the class, the story of my
first evening in class is a composite
based on several sessions; so is the
story of Greg and Emily, which is based
on
many
interviews
with
similar
couples. Subject to the limitations of
21/929
memory, all other stories are recounted
as they happened or were told to me. I
did not fact-check the stories people
told me about themselves, but only in-
cluded those I believed to be true.

INTRODUCTION
The North and South of
Temperament
Montgomery,
Alabama.
December
1,
1955. Early evening. A public bus pulls
to a stop and a sensibly dressed woman
in her forties gets on. She carries her-
self erectly, despite having spent the
day bent over an ironing board in a
dingy
basement
tailor
shop
at
the
Montgomery Fair department store. Her
feet are swollen, her shoulders ache.
She sits in the first row of the Colored
section and watches quietly as the bus
fills with riders. Until the driver orders
her
to
give
her
seat
to
a
white
passenger.
The woman utters a single word that
ignites one of the most important civil
rights protests of the twentieth century,
one word that helps America find its
better self.
The word is “No.”
The driver threatens to have her
arrested.
“You may do that,” says Rosa Parks.
A police officer arrives. He asks Parks
why she won’t move.
“Why do you all push us around?”
she answers simply.
“I don’t know,” he says. “But the law
is the law, and you’re under arrest.”
On the afternoon of her trial and con-
viction
for
disorderly
conduct,
the
Montgomery Improvement Association
holds a rally for Parks at the Holt Street
Baptist Church, in the poorest section
of town. Five thousand gather to sup-
port Parks’s lonely act of courage. They
24/929
squeeze inside the church until its pews
can hold no more. The rest wait pa-
tiently outside, listening through loud-
speakers. The Reverend Martin Luther
King Jr. addresses the crowd. “There
comes a time that people get tired of
being trampled over by the iron feet of
oppression,”
he
tells
them.
“There
comes a time when people get tired of
being pushed out of the glittering sun-
light of life’s July and left standing
amidst the piercing chill of an Alpine
November.”
He praises Parks’s bravery and hugs
her. She stands silently, her mere pres-
ence enough to galvanize the crowd.
The association launches a city-wide
bus boycott that lasts 381 days. The
people trudge miles to work. They car-
pool with strangers. They change the
course of American history.
25/929
I had always imagined Rosa Parks as
a stately woman with a bold tempera-
ment, someone who could easily stand
up to a busload of glowering passen-
gers. But when she died in 2005 at the
age of ninety-two, the flood of obituar-
ies recalled her as soft-spoken, sweet,
and small in stature. They said she was
“timid and shy” but had “the courage
of a lion.” They were full of phrases
like “radical humility” and “quiet forti-
tude.” What does it mean to be quiet
and have fortitude? these descriptions
asked implicitly. How could you be shy
and courageous?
Parks herself seemed aware of this
paradox,
calling
her
autobiography
Quiet Strength—a title that challenges us
to
question
our
assumptions.
Why
shouldn’t quiet be strong? And what
else can quiet do that we don’t give it
credit for?
26/929
Our lives are shaped as profoundly by
personality as by gender or race. And
the single most important aspect of per-
sonality—the “north and south of tem-
perament,” as one scientist puts it—is
where we fall on the introvert-extrovert
spectrum. Our place on this continuum
influences our choice of friends and
mates, and how we make conversation,
resolve differences, and show love. It
affects
the
careers
we
choose
and
whether or not we succeed at them. It
governs how likely we are to exercise,
commit adultery, function well without
sleep, learn from our mistakes, place
big bets in the stock market, delay grat-
ification, be a good leader, and ask
“what if.”* It’s reflected in our brain
pathways,
neurotransmitters,
and
27/929
remote corners of our nervous systems.
Today
introversion
and
extroversion
are two of the most exhaustively re-
searched subjects in personality psycho-
logy, arousing the curiosity of hundreds
of scientists.
These researchers have made exciting
discoveries aided by the latest techno-
logy, but they’re part of a long and
storied tradition. Poets and philosoph-
ers have been thinking about introverts
and extroverts since the dawn of recor-
ded time. Both personality types appear
in the Bible and in the writings of
Greek and Roman physicians, and some
evolutionary psychologists say that the
history of these types reaches back even
farther than that: the animal kingdom
also
boasts
“introverts”
and
“extroverts,” as we’ll see, from fruit
flies to pumpkinseed fish to rhesus
monkeys. As with other complementary
28/929
pairings—masculinity
and
femininity,
East and West, liberal and conservat-
ive—humanity would be unrecogniz-
able, and vastly diminished, without
both personality styles.
Take the partnership of Rosa Parks
and Martin Luther King Jr.: a formid-
able orator refusing to give up his seat
on a segregated bus wouldn’t have had
the same effect as a modest woman
who’d clearly prefer to keep silent but
for the exigencies of the situation. And
Parks didn’t have the stuff to thrill a
crowd if she’d tried to stand up and an-
nounce that she had a dream. But with
King’s help, she didn’t have to.
Yet today we make room for a re-
markably narrow range of personality
styles. We’re told that to be great is to
be bold, to be happy is to be sociable.
We see ourselves as a nation of extro-
verts—which
means
that
we’ve
lost
29/929
sight of who we really are. Depending
on which study you consult, one third
to one half of Americans are intro-
verts—in other words, one out of every
two or three people you know. (Given
that the United States is among the
most extroverted of nations, the num-
ber must be at least as high in other
parts of the world.) If you’re not an in-
trovert yourself, you are surely raising,
managing, married to, or coupled with
one.
If these statistics surprise you, that’s
probably because so many people pre-
tend to be extroverts. Closet introverts
pass
undetected
on
playgrounds,
in
high school locker rooms, and in the
corridors of corporate America. Some
fool even themselves, until some life
event—a layoff, an empty nest, an in-
heritance that frees them to spend time
as they like—jolts them into taking
30/929
stock of their true natures. You have
only to raise the subject of this book
with your friends and acquaintances to
find that the most unlikely people con-
sider themselves introverts.
It makes sense that so many intro-
verts hide even from themselves. We
live with a value system that I call the
Extrovert Ideal—the omnipresent belief
that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha,
and comfortable in the spotlight. The
archetypal extrovert prefers action to
contemplation, risk-taking to heed-tak-
ing, certainty to doubt. He favors quick
decisions, even at the risk of being
wrong. She works well in teams and so-
cializes in groups. We like to think that
we value individuality, but all too often
we admire one type of individual—the
kind who’s comfortable “putting him-
self out there.” Sure, we allow techno-
logically
gifted
loners
who
launch
31/929
companies in garages to have any per-
sonality they please, but they are the
exceptions, not the rule, and our toler-
ance extends mainly to those who get
fabulously wealthy or hold the promise
of doing so.
Introversion—along with its cousins
sensitivity, seriousness, and shyness—is
now a second-class personality trait,
somewhere between a disappointment
and a pathology. Introverts living under
the Extrovert Ideal are like women in a
man’s world, discounted because of a
trait that goes to the core of who they
are. Extroversion is an enormously ap-
pealing
personality
style,
but
we’ve
turned it into an oppressive standard to
which most of us feel we must conform.
The Extrovert Ideal has been docu-
mented in many studies, though this re-
search has never been grouped under a
single
name.
Talkative
people,
for
32/929
example, are rated as smarter, better-
looking, more interesting, and more de-
sirable as friends. Velocity of speech
counts as well as volume: we rank fast
talkers as more competent and likable
than slow ones. The same dynamics ap-
ply in groups, where research shows
that the voluble are considered smarter
than the reticent—even though there’s
zero correlation between the gift of gab
and good ideas. Even the word introvert
is stigmatized—one informal study, by
psychologist Laurie Helgoe, found that
introverts described their own physical
appearance in vivid language (“green-
blue
eyes,”
“exotic,”
“high
cheekbones”), but when asked to de-
scribe generic introverts they drew a
bland
and
distasteful
picture
(“ungainly,”
“neutral
colors,”
“skin
problems”).
33/929
But we make a grave mistake to em-
brace the Extrovert Ideal so unthink-
ingly. Some of our greatest ideas, art,
and
inventions—from
the
theory
of
evolution to van Gogh’s sunflowers to
the
personal
computer—came
from
quiet and cerebral people who knew
how to tune in to their inner worlds
and the treasures to be found there.
Without introverts, the world would be
devoid of:

the theory of relativity

As the science journalist Winifred
Gallagher writes: “The glory of the dis-
position that stops to consider stimuli
rather than rushing to engage with
them is its long association with intel-
lectual
and
artistic
achievement.
Neither E=mc2 nor Paradise Lost was
dashed off by a party animal.” Even in
less obviously introverted occupations,
like
finance,
politics,
and
activism,
some of the greatest leaps forward were
made by introverts. In this book we’ll
see how figures like Eleanor Roosevelt,
Al Gore, Warren Buffett, Gandhi—and
35/929
Rosa Parks—achieved what they did
not in spite of but because of their
introversion.
Yet, as Quiet will explore, many of
the most important institutions of con-
temporary life are designed for those
who enjoy group projects and high
levels of stimulation. As children, our
classroom desks are increasingly ar-
ranged in pods, the better to foster
group learning, and research suggests
that the vast majority of teachers be-
lieve that the ideal student is an extro-
vert. We watch TV shows whose prot-
agonists are not the “children next
door,”
like
the
Cindy
Bradys
and
Beaver Cleavers of yesteryear, but rock
stars and webcast hostesses with out-
sized
personalities,
like
Hannah
Montana and Carly Shay of iCarly. Even
Sid the Science Kid, a PBS-sponsored
role model for the preschool set, kicks
36/929
off
each
school
day
by
performing
dance moves with his pals. (“Check out
my moves! I’m a rock star!”)
As adults, many of us work for organ-
izations that insist we work in teams, in
offices without walls, for supervisors
who value “people skills” above all. To
advance our careers, we’re expected to
promote
ourselves
unabashedly.
The
scientists whose research gets funded
often have confident, perhaps overcon-
fident, personalities. The artists whose
work adorns the walls of contemporary
museums strike impressive poses at gal-
lery openings. The authors whose books
get published—once accepted as a re-
clusive breed—are now vetted by publi-
cists to make sure they’re talk-show
ready. (You wouldn’t be reading this
book if I hadn’t convinced my publisher
that I was enough of a pseudo-extrovert
to promote it.)
37/929
If you’re an introvert, you also know
that the bias against quiet can cause
deep psychic pain. As a child you might
have overheard your parents apologize
for your shyness. (“Why can’t you be
more
like
the
Kennedy
boys?”
the
Camelot-besotted parents of one man I
interviewed repeatedly asked him.) Or
at school you might have been prodded
to come “out of your shell”—that nox-
ious expression which fails to appreci-
ate that some animals naturally carry
shelter everywhere they go, and that
some humans are just the same. “All
the comments from childhood still ring
in my ears, that I was lazy, stupid,
slow, boring,” writes a member of an e-
mail list called Introvert Retreat. “By
the time I was old enough to figure out
that I was simply introverted, it was a
part of my being, the assumption that
there is something inherently wrong
38/929
with me. I wish I could find that little
vestige of doubt and remove it.”
Now that you’re an adult, you might
still feel a pang of guilt when you de-
cline a dinner invitation in favor of a
good book. Or maybe you like to eat
alone
in
restaurants
and
could
do
without the pitying looks from fellow
diners. Or you’re told that you’re “in
your head too much,” a phrase that’s
often deployed against the quiet and
cerebral.
Of course, there’s another word for
such people: thinkers.
I have seen firsthand how difficult it is
for introverts to take stock of their own
talents, and how powerful it is when fi-
nally they do. For more than ten years I
39/929
trained people of all stripes—corporate
lawyers and college students, hedge-
fund managers and married couples—in
negotiation
skills.
Of
course,
we
covered the basics: how to prepare for a
negotiation, when to make the first of-
fer, and what to do when the other per-
son says “take it or leave it.” But I also
helped clients figure out their natural
personalities and how to make the most
of them.
My very first client was a young wo-
man named Laura. She was a Wall
Street lawyer, but a quiet and day-
dreamy one who dreaded the spotlight
and disliked aggression. She had man-
aged somehow to make it through the
crucible
of
Harvard
Law
School—a
place where classes are conducted in
huge, gladiatorial amphitheaters, and
where she once got so nervous that she
threw up on the way to class. Now that
40/929
she was in the real world, she wasn’t
sure she could represent her clients as
forcefully as they expected.
For the first three years on the job,
Laura was so junior that she never had
to test this premise. But one day the
senior lawyer she’d been working with
went on vacation, leaving her in charge
of an important negotiation. The client
was a South American manufacturing
company that was about to default on a
bank loan and hoped to renegotiate its
terms;
a
syndicate
of
bankers
that
owned the endangered loan sat on the
other side of the negotiating table.
Laura would have preferred to hide
under said table, but she was accus-
tomed
to
fighting
such
impulses.
Gamely but nervously, she took her
spot in the lead chair, flanked by her
clients: general counsel on one side and
senior financial officer on the other.
41/929
These happened to be Laura’s favorite
clients: gracious and soft-spoken, very
different
from
the
master-of-the-uni-
verse types her firm usually represen-
ted. In the past, Laura had taken the
general counsel to a Yankees game and
the financial officer shopping for a
handbag for her sister. But now these
cozy outings—just the kind of socializ-
ing Laura enjoyed—seemed a world
away. Across the table sat nine dis-
gruntled investment bankers in tailored
suits and expensive shoes, accompanied
by their lawyer, a square-jawed woman
with a hearty manner. Clearly not the
self-doubting
type,
this
woman
launched into an impressive speech on
how Laura’s clients would be lucky
simply to accept the bankers’ terms. It
was, she said, a very magnanimous
offer.
42/929
Everyone waited for Laura to reply,
but she couldn’t think of anything to
say. So she just sat there. Blinking. All
eyes on her. Her clients shifting uneas-
ily in their seats. Her thoughts running
in a familiar loop: I’m too quiet for this
kind of thing, too unassuming, too cereb-
ral.
She
imagined
the
person
who
would be better equipped to save the
day: someone bold, smooth, ready to
pound the table. In middle school this
person, unlike Laura, would have been
called “outgoing,” the highest accolade
her
seventh-grade
classmates
knew,
higher even than “pretty,” for a girl, or
“athletic,” for a guy. Laura promised
herself that she only had to make it
through the day. Tomorrow she would
go look for another career.
Then she remembered what I’d told
her again and again: she was an intro-
vert,
and
as
such
she
had
unique
43/929
powers in negotiation—perhaps less ob-
vious but no less formidable. She’d
probably prepared more than everyone
else. She had a quiet but firm speaking
style. She rarely spoke without think-
ing. Being mild-mannered, she could
take strong, even aggressive, positions
while coming across as perfectly reas-
onable. And she tended to ask ques-
tions—lots of them—and actually listen
to the answers, which, no matter what
your personality, is crucial to strong
negotiation.
So Laura finally started doing what
came naturally.
“Let’s go back a step. What are your
numbers based on?” she asked.
“What if we structured the loan this
way, do you think it might work?”
“That way?”
“Some other way?”
44/929
At first her questions were tentative.
She picked up steam as she went along,
posing them more forcefully and mak-
ing it clear that she’d done her home-
work and wouldn’t concede the facts.
But she also stayed true to her own
style, never raising her voice or losing
her decorum. Every time the bankers
made an assertion that seemed un-
budgeable, Laura tried to be construct-
ive. “Are you saying that’s the only way
to go? What if we took a different
approach?”
Eventually her simple queries shifted
the mood in the room, just as the nego-
tiation textbooks say they will. The
bankers
stopped
speechifying
and
dominance-posing, activities for which
Laura felt hopelessly ill-equipped, and
they
started
having
an
actual
conversation.
45/929
More discussion. Still no agreement.
One of the bankers revved up again,
throwing his papers down and storming
out of the room. Laura ignored this dis-
play, mostly because she didn’t know
what else to do. Later on someone told
her that at that pivotal moment she’d
played
a
good
game
of
something
called
“negotiation
jujitsu”;
but
she
knew that she was just doing what you
learn to do naturally as a quiet person
in a loudmouth world.
Finally the two sides struck a deal.
The bankers left the building, Laura’s
favorite clients headed for the airport,
and Laura went home, curled up with a
book, and tried to forget the day’s
tensions.
But the next morning, the lead law-
yer for the bankers—the vigorous wo-
man with the strong jaw—called to of-
fer her a job. “I’ve never seen anyone
46/929
so nice and so tough at the same time,”
she said. And the day after that, the
lead banker called Laura, asking if her
law firm would represent his company
in the future. “We need someone who
can help us put deals together without
letting ego get in the way,” he said.
By sticking to her own gentle way of
doing things, Laura had reeled in new
business for her firm and a job offer for
herself. Raising her voice and pounding
the table was unnecessary.
Today Laura understands that her in-
troversion is an essential part of who
she is, and she embraces her reflective
nature. The loop inside her head that
accused her of being too quiet and un-
assuming plays much less often. Laura
knows that she can hold her own when
she needs to.
47/929
What exactly do I mean when I say that
Laura is an introvert? When I started
writing this book, the first thing I
wanted to find out was precisely how
researchers define introversion and ex-
troversion. I knew that in 1921 the in-
fluential psychologist Carl Jung had
published a bombshell of a book, Psy-
chological Types, popularizing the terms
introvert and extrovert as the central
building blocks of personality. Intro-
verts are drawn to the inner world of
thought and feeling, said Jung, extro-
verts to the external life of people and
activities. Introverts focus on the mean-
ing they make of the events swirling
around them; extroverts plunge into the
events themselves. Introverts recharge
their
batteries
by
being
alone;
48/929
extroverts need to recharge when they
don’t socialize enough. If you’ve ever
taken a Myers-Briggs personality test,
which is based on Jung’s thinking and
used by the majority of universities and
Fortune 100 companies, then you may
already be familiar with these ideas.
But what do contemporary research-
ers have to say? I soon discovered that
there is no all-purpose definition of in-
troversion or extroversion; these are
not
unitary
categories,
like
“curly-
haired” or “sixteen-year-old,” in which
everyone can agree on who qualifies for
inclusion. For example, adherents of
the Big Five school of personality psy-
chology (which argues that human per-
sonality can be boiled down to five
primary traits) define introversion not
in terms of a rich inner life but as a
lack of qualities such as assertiveness
and sociability. There are almost as
49/929
many definitions of introvert and extro-
vert as there are personality psycholo-
gists, who spend a great deal of time ar-
guing over which meaning is most ac-
curate. Some think that Jung’s ideas are
outdated; others swear that he’s the
only one who got it right.
Still, today’s psychologists tend to
agree on several important points: for
example, that introverts and extroverts
differ in the level of outside stimulation
that they need to function well. Intro-
verts feel “just right” with less stimula-
tion, as when they sip wine with a close
friend, solve a crossword puzzle, or
read a book. Extroverts enjoy the extra
bang that comes from activities like
meeting new people, skiing slippery
slopes, and cranking up the stereo.
“Other people are very arousing,” says
the
personality
psychologist
David
Winter, explaining why your typical
50/929
introvert would rather spend her vaca-
tion reading on the beach than partying
on a cruise ship. “They arouse threat,
fear, flight, and love. A hundred people
are very stimulating compared to a
hundred books or a hundred grains of
sand.”
Many psychologists would also agree
that introverts and extroverts work dif-
ferently. Extroverts tend to tackle as-
signments
quickly.
They
make
fast
(sometimes rash) decisions, and are
comfortable multitasking and risk-tak-
ing. They enjoy “the thrill of the chase”
for rewards like money and status.
Introverts often work more slowly
and deliberately. They like to focus on
one task at a time and can have mighty
powers of concentration. They’re relat-
ively immune to the lures of wealth and
fame.
51/929
Our personalities also shape our so-
cial styles. Extroverts are the people
who will add life to your dinner party
and laugh generously at your jokes.
They tend to be assertive, dominant,
and in great need of company. Extro-
verts think out loud and on their feet;
they prefer talking to listening, rarely
find themselves at a loss for words, and
occasionally blurt out things they never
meant to say. They’re comfortable with
conflict, but not with solitude.
Introverts,
in
contrast,
may
have
strong social skills and enjoy parties
and
business
meetings,
but
after
a
while wish they were home in their pa-
jamas. They prefer to devote their so-
cial
energies
to
close
friends,
col-
leagues, and family. They listen more
than they talk, think before they speak,
and often feel as if they express them-
selves
better
in
writing
than
in
52/929
conversation. They tend to dislike con-
flict. Many have a horror of small talk,
but enjoy deep discussions.
A few things introverts are not: The
word introvert is not a synonym for her-
mit or misanthrope. Introverts can be
these things, but most are perfectly
friendly.
One
of
the
most
humane
phrases in the English language—“Only
connect!”—was
written
by
the
dis-
tinctly introverted E. M. Forster in a
novel exploring the question of how to
achieve “human love at its height.”
Nor are introverts necessarily shy.
Shyness is the fear of social disapproval
or humiliation, while introversion is a
preference for environments that are
not overstimulating. Shyness is inher-
ently painful; introversion is not. One
reason that people confuse the two con-
cepts is that they sometimes overlap
(though psychologists debate to what
53/929
degree). Some psychologists map the
two tendencies on vertical and hori-
zontal axes, with the introvert-extrovert
spectrum on the horizontal axis, and
the anxious-stable spectrum on the ver-
tical. With this model, you end up with
four quadrants of personality types:
calm extroverts, anxious (or impulsive)
extroverts, calm introverts, and anxious
introverts. In other words, you can be a
shy extrovert, like Barbra Streisand,
who has a larger-than-life personality
and paralyzing stage fright; or a non-
shy introvert, like Bill Gates, who by all
accounts keeps to himself but is un-
fazed by the opinions of others.
You can also, of course, be both shy
and an introvert: T. S. Eliot was a fam-
ously private soul who wrote in “The
Waste Land” that he could “show you
fear in a handful of dust.” Many shy
people turn inward, partly as a refuge
54/929
from the socializing that causes them
such anxiety. And many introverts are
shy, partly as a result of receiving the
message that there’s something wrong
with their preference for reflection, and
partly because their physiologies, as
we’ll see, compel them to withdraw
from high-stimulation environments.
But for all their differences, shyness
and
introversion
have
in
common
something profound. The mental state
of a shy extrovert sitting quietly in a
business meeting may be very different
from that of a calm introvert—the shy
person is afraid to speak up, while the
introvert is simply overstimulated—but
to the outside world, the two appear to
be the same. This can give both types
insight into how our reverence for al-
pha status blinds us to things that are
good and smart and wise. For very dif-
ferent
reasons,
shy
and
introverted
55/929
people might choose to spend their
days in behind-the-scenes pursuits like
inventing, or researching, or holding
the hands of the gravely ill—or in lead-
ership positions they execute with quiet
competence. These are not alpha roles,
but the people who play them are role
models all the same.
If you’re still not sure where you fall on
the introvert-extrovert spectrum, you
can assess yourself here. Answer each
question “true” or “false,” choosing the
answer that applies to you more often
than not.*
1. _______ I prefer one-on-one conversa-
tions to group activities.
56/929
2. _______ I often prefer to express my-
self in writing.
3. _______ I enjoy solitude.
4. _______ I seem to care less than my
peers about wealth, fame,
and status.
5. _______ I dislike small talk, but I en-
joy talking in depth about
topics that matter to me.
6. _______ People tell me that I’m a
good listener.
7. _______ I’m not a big risk-taker.
8. _______ I enjoy work that allows me
to
“dive
in”
with
few
interruptions.
9. _______ I like to celebrate birthdays
on a small scale, with only
one or two close friends or
family members.
57/929
10. _______ People describe me as “soft-
spoken” or “mellow.”
11. _______ I prefer not to show or dis-
cuss my work with others
until it’s finished.
12. _______ I dislike conflict.
13. _______ I do my best work on my
own.
14. _______ I tend to think before I speak.
15. _______ I feel drained after being out
and about, even if I’ve en-
joyed myself.
16. _______ I often let calls go through to
voice mail.
17. _______ If I had to choose, I’d prefer a
weekend
with
absolutely
nothing to do to one with
too many things scheduled.
18. _______ I don’t enjoy multitasking.
19. _______ I can concentrate easily.
58/929
20. _______ In classroom situations, I
prefer lectures to seminars.
The more often you answered “true,”
the more introverted you probably are.
If you found yourself with a roughly
equal number of “true” and “false” an-
swers,
then
you
may
be
an
ambi-
vert—yes, there really is such a word.
But
even
if
you
answered
every
single question as an introvert or extro-
vert, that doesn’t mean that your beha-
vior is predictable across all circum-
stances. We can’t say that every intro-
vert is a bookworm or every extrovert
wears lampshades at parties any more
than we can say that every woman is a
natural
consensus-builder
and
every
man loves contact sports. As Jung feli-
citously put it, “There is no such thing
as a pure extrovert or a pure introvert.
59/929
Such a man would be in the lunatic
asylum.”
This is partly because we are all glor-
iously complex individuals, but also be-
cause there are so many different kinds
of introverts and extroverts. Introver-
sion and extroversion interact with our
other personality traits and personal
histories,
producing
wildly
different
kinds of people. So if you’re an artistic
American
guy
whose
father
wished
you’d try out for the football team like
your rough-and-tumble brothers, you’ll
be a very different kind of introvert
from, say, a Finnish businesswoman
whose parents were lighthouse keepers.
(Finland is a famously introverted na-
tion. Finnish joke: How can you tell if a
Finn likes you? He’s staring at your
shoes instead of his own.)
Many
introverts
are
also
“highly
sensitive,” which sounds poetic, but is
60/929
actually a technical term in psychology.
If you are a sensitive sort, then you’re
more apt than the average person to
feel pleasantly overwhelmed by Beeth-
oven’s “Moonlight Sonata” or a well-
turned phrase or an act of extraordin-
ary kindness. You may be quicker than
others to feel sickened by violence and
ugliness, and you likely have a very
strong conscience. When you were a
child you were probably called “shy,”
and to this day feel nervous when
you’re being evaluated, for example
when giving a speech or on a first date.
Later we’ll examine why this seemingly
unrelated collection of attributes tends
to belong to the same person and why
this person is often introverted. (No one
knows exactly how many introverts are
highly sensitive, but we know that 70
percent of sensitives are introverts, and
61/929
the other 30 percent tend to report
needing a lot of “down time.”)
All of this complexity means that not
everything you read in Quiet will apply
to you, even if you consider yourself a
true-blue introvert. For one thing, we’ll
spend some time talking about shyness
and sensitivity, while you might have
neither of these traits. That’s OK. Take
what applies to you, and use the rest to
improve your relationships with others.
Having said all this, in Quiet we’ll try
not to get too hung up on definitions.
Strictly defining terms is vital for re-
searchers whose studies depend on pin-
pointing
exactly
where
introversion
stops and other traits, like shyness,
start.
But
in
Quiet
we’ll
concern
ourselves more with the fruit of that re-
search. Today’s psychologists, joined by
neuroscientists with their brain-scan-
ning
machines,
have
unearthed
62/929
illuminating insights that are changing
the
way
we
see
the
world—and
ourselves. They are answering ques-
tions such as: Why are some people
talkative while others measure their
words? Why do some people burrow in-
to their work and others organize office
birthday parties? Why are some people
comfortable wielding authority while
others prefer neither to lead nor to be
led? Can introverts be leaders? Is our
cultural preference for extroversion in
the natural order of things, or is it so-
cially determined? From an evolution-
ary perspective, introversion must have
survived as a personality trait for a
reason—so what might the reason be?
If you’re an introvert, should you de-
vote your energies to activities that
come naturally, or should you stretch
yourself, as Laura did that day at the
negotiation table?
63/929
The answers might surprise you.
If there is only one insight you take
away from this book, though, I hope it’s
a newfound sense of entitlement to be
yourself. I can vouch personally for the
life-transforming effects of this outlook.
Remember that first client I told you
about, the one I called Laura in order to
protect her identity?
That was a story about me. I was my
own first client.

THE EXTROVERT IDEAL

THE RISE OF THE “MIGHTY
LIKEABLE FELLOW”
How Extroversion Became the Cultural
Ideal
Strangers’ eyes, keen and critical.
Can you meet them
proudly—confidently—without fear?
—PRINT ADVERTISEMENT FOR
WOODBURY’S SOAP, 1922
The date: 1902. The place: Harmony
Church, Missouri, a tiny, dot-on-the-
map town located on a floodplain a
hundred miles from Kansas City. Our
young protagonist: a good-natured but
insecure high school student named
Dale.
Skinny, unathletic, and fretful, Dale
is the son of a morally upright but per-
petually bankrupt pig farmer. He re-
spects his parents but dreads following
in their poverty-stricken footsteps. Dale
worries about other things, too: thun-
der and lightning, going to hell, and
being tongue-tied at crucial moments.
He even fears his wedding day: What if
he can’t think of anything to say to his
future bride?
One
day
a
Chautauqua
speaker
comes to town. The Chautauqua move-
ment, born in 1873 and based in up-
state New York, sends gifted speakers
across the country to lecture on literat-
ure, science, and religion. Rural Amer-
icans prize these presenters for the
whiff of glamour they bring from the
outside
world—and
their
power
to
68/929
mesmerize an audience. This particular
speaker captivates the young Dale with
his own rags-to-riches tale: once he’d
been a lowly farm boy with a bleak fu-
ture, but he developed a charismatic
speaking style and took the stage at
Chautauqua. Dale hangs on his every
word.
A few years later, Dale is again im-
pressed by the value of public speaking.
His family moves to a farm three miles
outside of Warrensburg, Missouri, so he
can attend college there without paying
room and board. Dale observes that the
students
who
win
campus
speaking
contests are seen as leaders, and he re-
solves to be one of them. He signs up
for every contest and rushes home at
night to practice. Again and again he
loses; Dale is dogged, but not much of
an orator. Eventually, though, his ef-
forts begin to pay off. He transforms
69/929
himself into a speaking champion and
campus hero. Other students turn to
him for speech lessons; he trains them
and they start winning, too.
By the time Dale leaves college in
1908, his parents are still poor, but cor-
porate America is booming. Henry Ford
is selling Model Ts like griddle cakes,
using the slogan “for business and for
pleasure.” J.C. Penney, Woolworth, and
Sears Roebuck have become household
names. Electricity lights up the homes
of the middle class; indoor plumbing
spares
them
midnight
trips
to
the
outhouse.
The new economy calls for a new
kind of man—a salesman, a social oper-
ator, someone with a ready smile, a
masterful handshake, and the ability to
get along with colleagues while simul-
taneously outshining them. Dale joins
the swelling ranks of salesmen, heading
70/929
out on the road with few possessions
but his silver tongue.
Dale’s
last
name
is
Carnegie
(Carnagey,
actually;
he changes
the
spelling later, likely to evoke Andrew,
the great industrialist). After a few
grueling years selling beef for Armour
and Company, he sets up shop as a
public-speaking teacher. Carnegie holds
his first class at a YMCA night school
on 125th Street in New York City. He
asks for the usual two-dollars-per-ses-
sion salary for night school teachers.
The Y’s director, doubting that a public-
speaking class will generate much in-
terest,
refuses
to
pay
that
kind
of
money.
But the class is an overnight sensa-
tion, and Carnegie goes on to found the
Dale Carnegie Institute, dedicated to
helping businessmen root out the very
insecurities that had held him back as a
71/929
young man. In 1913 he publishes his
first book, Public Speaking and Influen-
cing Men in Business. “In the days when
pianos and bathrooms were luxuries,”
Carnegie writes, “men regarded ability
in speaking as a peculiar gift, needed
only
by
the
lawyer,
clergyman,
or
statesman. Today we have come to
realize
that
it
is
the
indispensable
weapon
of
those
who
would
forge
ahead
in
the
keen
competition
of
business.”
Carnegie’s metamorphosis from farm-
boy to salesman to public-speaking icon
is also the story of the rise of the Extro-
vert Ideal. Carnegie’s journey reflected
a cultural evolution that reached a tip-
ping
point
around
the
turn
of
the
72/929
twentieth
century,
changing
forever
who we are and whom we admire, how
we act at job interviews and what we
look for in an employee, how we court
our mates and raise our children. Amer-
ica had shifted from what the influen-
tial cultural historian Warren Susman
called a Culture of Character to a Cul-
ture of Personality—and opened up a
Pandora’s
Box
of
personal
anxieties
from
which
we
would
never
quite
recover.
In the Culture of Character, the ideal
self was serious, disciplined, and honor-
able. What counted was not so much
the impression one made in public as
how one behaved in private. The word
personality didn’t exist in English until
the eighteenth century, and the idea of
“having a good personality” was not
widespread until the twentieth.
73/929
But when they embraced the Culture
of Personality, Americans started to fo-
cus on how others perceived them.
They became captivated by people who
were bold and entertaining. “The social
role demanded of all in the new Culture
of Personality was that of a performer,”
Susman famously wrote. “Every Amer-
ican was to become a performing self.”
The rise of industrial America was a
major force behind this cultural evolu-
tion.
The
nation
quickly
developed
from an agricultural society of little
houses on the prairie to an urbanized,
“the business of America is business”
powerhouse.
In
the
country’s
early
days, most Americans lived like Dale
Carnegie’s family, on farms or in small
towns, interacting with people they’d
known since childhood. But when the
twentieth century arrived, a perfect
storm of big business, urbanization, and
74/929
mass immigration blew the population
into the cities. In 1790, only 3 percent
of Americans lived in cities; in 1840,
only 8 percent did; by 1920, more than
a third of the country were urbanites.
“We cannot all live in cities,” wrote the
news editor Horace Greeley in 1867,
“yet nearly all seem determined to do
so.”
Americans found themselves working
no
longer
with
neighbors
but
with
strangers. “Citizens” morphed into “em-
ployees,” facing the question of how to
make a good impression on people to
whom they had no civic or family ties.
“The reasons why one man gained a
promotion or one woman suffered a so-
cial snub,” writes the historian Roland
Marchand, “had become less explicable
on grounds of long-standing favoritism
or old family feuds. In the increasingly
anonymous
business
and
social
75/929
relationships of the age, one might sus-
pect that anything—including a first
impression—had made the crucial dif-
ference.” Americans responded to these
pressures by trying to become salesmen
who could sell not only their company’s
latest gizmo but also themselves.
One
of the most
powerful
lenses
through which to view the transforma-
tion from Character to Personality is
the self-help tradition in which Dale
Carnegie played such a prominent role.
Self-help books have always loomed
large in the American psyche. Many of
the earliest conduct guides were reli-
gious parables, like The Pilgrim’s Pro-
gress, published in 1678, which warned
readers to behave with restraint if they
wanted to make it into heaven. The ad-
vice manuals of the nineteenth century
were less religious but still preached
the value of a noble character. They
76/929
featured case studies of historical her-
oes like Abraham Lincoln, revered not
only as a gifted communicator but also
as a modest man who did not, as Ralph
Waldo Emerson put it, “offend by su-
periority.” They also celebrated regular
people who lived highly moral lives. A
popular 1899 manual called Character:
The Grandest Thing in the World featured
a timid shop girl who gave away her
meager earnings to a freezing beggar,
then rushed off before anyone could see
what she’d done. Her virtue, the reader
understood, derived not only from her
generosity but also from her wish to re-
main anonymous.
But by 1920, popular self-help guides
had changed their focus from inner vir-
tue to outer charm—“to know what to
say and how to say it,” as one manual
put
it.
“To
create
a
personality
is
power,” advised another. “Try in every
77/929
way to have a ready command of the
manners which make people think ‘he’s
a mighty likeable fellow,’ ” said a third.
“That is the beginning of a reputation
for personality.” Success magazine and
The Saturday Evening Post introduced
departments instructing readers on the
art of conversation. The same author,
Orison Swett Marden, who wrote Char-
acter: The Grandest Thing in the World in
1899, produced another popular title in
1921.
It
was
called
Masterful
Personality.
Many of these guides were written
for businessmen, but women were also
urged to work on a mysterious quality
called “fascination.” Coming of age in
the 1920s was such a competitive busi-
ness compared to what their grand-
mothers had experienced, warned one
beauty guide, that they had to be vis-
ibly charismatic: “People who pass us
78/929
on the street can’t know that we’re
clever and charming unless we look it.”
Such advice—ostensibly meant to im-
prove people’s lives—must have made
even reasonably confident people un-
easy. Susman counted the words that
appeared
most
frequently
in
the
personality-driven advice manuals of
the early twentieth century and com-
pared them to the character guides of
the
nineteenth
century.
The
earlier
guides emphasized attributes that any-
one
could
work
on
improving,
de-
scribed by words like
Citizenship
Duty
Work
Golden deeds
Honor
Reputation
Morals
79/929
Manners
Integrity
But the new guides celebrated qualit-
ies that were—no matter how easy Dale
Carnegie made it sound—trickier to ac-
quire. Either you embodied these qual-
ities or you didn’t:
Magnetic
Fascinating
Stunning
Attractive
Glowing
Dominant
Forceful
Energetic
It was no coincidence that in the
1920s and the 1930s, Americans be-
came obsessed with movie stars. Who
80/929
better than a matinee idol to model
personal magnetism?
Americans also received advice on self-
presentation—whether they liked it or
not—from
the
advertising
industry.
While early print ads were straightfor-
ward product announcements (“EATON’S
HIGHLAND LINEN: THE FRESHEST AND CLEANEST
WRITING
PAPER”), the new personality-
driven
ads
cast
consumers
as
per-
formers with stage fright from which
only the advertiser’s product might res-
cue them. These ads focused obsess-
ively on the hostile glare of the public
spotlight. “ALL AROUND
YOU PEOPLE ARE
JUDGING YOU SILENTLY,” warned a 1922 ad
for Woodbury’s soap. “CRITICAL EYES ARE
81/929
SIZING YOU UP RIGHT NOW,” advised the
Williams Shaving Cream company.
Madison Avenue spoke directly to the
anxieties of male salesmen and middle
managers. In one ad for Dr. West’s
toothbrushes, a prosperous-looking fel-
low sat behind a desk, his arm cocked
confidently
behind
his
hip,
asking
whether
you’ve
“EVER
TRIED
SELLING
YOURSELF
TO
YOU?
A
FAVORABLE
FIRST
IMPRESSION IS THE GREATEST SINGLE FACTOR IN
BUSINESS OR SOCIAL SUCCESS.” The Williams
Shaving Cream ad featured a slick-
haired, mustachioed man urging read-
ers to “LET YOUR FACE REFLECT CONFIDENCE,
NOT WORRY! IT’S THE ‘LOOK’ OF YOU BY WHICH
YOU ARE JUDGED MOST OFTEN.”
Other ads reminded women that their
success in the dating game depended
not only on looks but also on personal-
ity. In 1921 a Woodbury’s soap ad
82/929
showed a crestfallen young woman,
home alone after a disappointing even-
ing out. She had “longed to be success-
ful, gay, triumphant,” the text sympath-
ized. But without the help of the right
soap, the woman was a social failure.
Ten years later, Lux laundry deter-
gent ran a print ad featuring a plaintive
letter written to Dorothy Dix, the Dear
Abby of her day. “Dear Miss Dix,” read
the letter, “How can I make myself
more popular? I am fairly pretty and
not a dumbbell, but I am so timid and
self-conscious with people. I’m always
sure they’re not going to like me.…
—Joan G.”
Miss Dix’s answer came back clear
and firm. If only Joan would use Lux
detergent on her lingerie, curtains, and
sofa cushions, she would soon gain a
“deep, sure, inner conviction of being
charming.”
83/929
This portrayal of courtship as a high-
stakes performance reflected the bold
new mores of the Culture of Personal-
ity. Under the restrictive (in some cases
repressive) social codes of the Culture
of Character, both genders displayed
some reserve when it came to the mat-
ing dance. Women who were too loud
or made inappropriate eye contact with
strangers
were
considered
brazen.
Upper-class women had more license to
speak than did their lower-class coun-
terparts, and indeed were judged partly
on their talent for witty repartee, but
even
they
were
advised
to
display
blushes and downcast eyes. They were
warned by conduct manuals that “the
coldest reserve” was “more admirable
in a woman a man wishe[d] to make
his wife than the least approach to un-
due familiarity.” Men could adopt a
quiet
demeanor
that
implied
self-
84/929
possession and a power that didn’t need
to flaunt itself. Though shyness per se
was unacceptable, reserve was a mark
of good breeding.
But with the advent of the Culture of
Personality,
the
value
of
formality
began to crumble, for women and men
alike.
Instead
of
paying
ceremonial
calls on women and making serious de-
clarations of intention, men were now
expected to launch verbally sophistic-
ated courtships in which they threw
women “a line” of elaborate flirtatious-
ness. Men who were too quiet around
women risked being thought gay; as a
popular 1926 sex guide observed, “ho-
mosexuals are invariably timid, shy, re-
tiring.” Women, too, were expected to
walk a fine line between propriety and
boldness. If they responded too shyly to
romantic overtures, they were some-
times called “frigid.”
85/929
The field of psychology also began to
grapple with the pressure to project
confidence. In the 1920s an influential
psychologist named Gordon Allport cre-
ated a diagnostic test of “Ascendance-
Submission” to measure social domin-
ance. “Our current civilization,” ob-
served Allport, who was himself shy
and reserved, “seems to place a premi-
um upon the aggressive person, the ‘go-
getter.’ ” In 1921, Carl Jung noted the
newly precarious status of introversion.
Jung himself saw introverts as “educat-
ors and promoters of culture” who
showed the value of “the interior life
which is so painfully wanting in our
civilization.” But he acknowledged that
their “reserve and apparently ground-
less embarrassment naturally arouse all
the
current
prejudices
against
this
type.”
86/929
But nowhere was the need to appear
self-assured more apparent than in a
new concept in psychology called the
inferiority complex. The IC, as it be-
came known in the popular press, was
developed in the 1920s by a Viennese
psychologist named Alfred Adler to de-
scribe feelings of inadequacy and their
consequences. “Do you feel insecure?”
inquired
the
cover
of
Adler’s
best-
selling
book,
Understanding
Human
Nature. “Are you fainthearted? Are you
submissive?” Adler explained that all
infants and small children feel inferior,
living as they do in a world of adults
and older siblings. In the normal pro-
cess of growing up they learn to direct
these feelings into pursuing their goals.
But if things go awry as they mature,
they might be saddled with the dreaded
IC—a grave liability in an increasingly
competitive society.
87/929
The idea of wrapping their social
anxieties in the neat package of a psy-
chological complex appealed to many
Americans. The Inferiority Complex be-
came an all-purpose explanation for
problems in many areas of life, ranging
from love to parenting to career. In
1924, Collier’s ran a story about a wo-
man who was afraid to marry the man
she loved for fear that he had an IC and
would
never
amount
to
anything.
Another popular magazine ran an art-
icle called “Your Child and That Fash-
ionable Complex,” explaining to moms
what could cause an IC in kids and how
to prevent or cure one. Everyone had an
IC, it seemed; to some it was, paradox-
ically enough, a mark of distinction.
Lincoln,
Napoleon,
Teddy
Roosevelt,
Edison,
and
Shakespeare—all
had
suffered from ICs, according to a 1939
Collier’s article. “So,” concluded the
88/929
magazine, “if you have a big, husky, in-
growing
inferiority
complex
you’re
about as lucky as you could hope to be,
provided you have the backbone along
with it.”
Despite
the
hopeful
tone
of
this
piece, child guidance experts of the
1920s set about helping children to de-
velop winning personalities. Until then,
these professionals had worried mainly
about sexually precocious girls and de-
linquent boys, but now psychologists,
social workers, and doctors focused on
the everyday child with the “maladjus-
ted personality”—particularly shy chil-
dren. Shyness could lead to dire out-
comes, they warned, from alcoholism to
suicide, while an outgoing personality
would bring social and financial suc-
cess. The experts advised parents to so-
cialize their children well and schools
to change their emphasis from book-
89/929
learning to “assisting and guiding the
developing personality.” Educators took
up
this
mantle
enthusiastically.
By
1950 the slogan of the Mid-Century
White House Conference on Children
and Youth was “A healthy personality
for every child.”
Well-meaning parents of the midcen-
tury agreed that quiet was unacceptable
and gregariousness ideal for both girls
and boys. Some discouraged their chil-
dren from solitary and serious hobbies,
like classical music, that could make
them unpopular. They sent their kids to
school
at
increasingly
young
ages,
where the main assignment was learn-
ing to socialize. Introverted children
were often singled out as problem cases
(a situation familiar to anyone with an
introverted child today).
William
Whyte’s
The
Organization
Man, a 1956 best-seller, describes how
90/929
parents and teachers conspired to over-
haul the personalities of quiet children.
“Johnny
wasn’t
doing
so
well
at
school,” Whyte recalls a mother telling
him. “The teacher explained to me that
he was doing fine on his lessons but
that his social adjustment was not as
good as it might be. He would pick just
one or two friends to play with, and
sometimes he was happy to remain by
himself.” Parents welcomed such inter-
ventions, said Whyte. “Save for a few
odd parents, most are grateful that the
schools work so hard to offset tenden-
cies to introversion and other suburban
abnormalities.”
Parents caught up in this value sys-
tem were not unkind, or even obtuse;
they were only preparing their kids for
the “real world.” When these children
grew older and applied to college and
later for their first jobs, they faced the
91/929
same
standards
of
gregariousness.
University admissions officers looked
not for the most exceptional candidates,
but for the most extroverted. Harvard’s
provost Paul Buck declared in the late
1940s that Harvard should reject the
“sensitive,
neurotic”
type
and
the
“intellectually over-stimulated” in favor
of boys of the “healthy extrovert kind.”
In 1950, Yale’s president, Alfred Whit-
ney Griswold, declared that the ideal
Yalie was not a “beetle-browed, highly
specialized
intellectual,
but
a
well-
rounded
man.”
Another
dean
told
Whyte that “in screening applications
from secondary schools he felt it was
only common sense to take into ac-
count
not
only
what
the
college
wanted, but what, four years later, cor-
porations’ recruiters would want. ‘They
like a pretty gregarious, active type,’ he
said. ‘So we find that the best man is
92/929
the one who’s had an 80 or 85 average
in school and plenty of extracurricular
activity. We see little use for the “bril-
liant” introvert.’ ”
This college dean grasped very well
that the model employee of the midcen-
tury—even one whose job rarely in-
volved dealing with the public, like a
research
scientist
in
a
corporate
lab—was not a deep thinker but a
hearty extrovert with a salesman’s per-
sonality. “Customarily, whenever the
word brilliant is used,” explains Whyte,
“it either precedes the word ‘but’ (e.g.,
‘We are all for brilliance, but …’) or is
coupled with such words as erratic, ec-
centric,
introvert,
screwball,
etc.”
“These fellows will be having contact
with other people in the organization,”
said one 1950s executive about the
hapless scientists in his employ, “and it
helps if they make a good impression.”
93/929
The scientist’s job was not only to do
the research but also to help sell it, and
that required a hail-fellow-well-met de-
meanor. At IBM, a corporation that em-
bodied the ideal of the company man,
the sales force gathered each morning
to belt out the company anthem, “Ever
Onward,” and to harmonize on the
“Selling IBM” song, set to the tune of
“Singin’ in the Rain.” “Selling IBM,” it
began, “we’re selling IBM. What a glori-
ous feeling, the world is our friend.”
The
ditty
built
to
a
stirring
close:
“We’re always in trim, we work with a
vim. We’re selling, just selling, IBM.”
Then they went off to pay their sales
calls,
proving
that
the
admissions
people at Harvard and Yale were prob-
ably right: only a certain type of fellow
could possibly have been interested in
kicking off his mornings this way.
94/929
The rest of the organization men
would have to manage as best they
could. And if the history of pharma-
ceutical consumption is any indication,
many buckled under such pressures. In
1955 a drug company named Carter-
Wallace released the anti-anxiety drug
Miltown, reframing anxiety as the nat-
ural product of a society that was both
dog-eat-dog
and
relentlessly
social.
Miltown was marketed to men and im-
mediately
became
the
fastest-selling
pharmaceutical in American history, ac-
cording to the social historian Andrea
Tone. By 1956 one of every twenty
Americans had tried it; by 1960 a third
of all prescriptions from U.S. doctors
were for Miltown or a similar drug
called Equanil. “ANXIETY AND TENSION ARE
THE COMMONPLACE OF THE AGE,” read the
Equanil ad. The 1960s tranquilizer Ser-
entil followed with an ad campaign
95/929
even more direct in its appeal to im-
prove
social
performance.
“FOR
THE
ANXIETY THAT COMES FROM NOT FITTING IN,”
it empathized.
Of course, the Extrovert Ideal is not a
modern invention. Extroversion is in
our DNA—literally, according to some
psychologists. The trait has been found
to be less prevalent in Asia and Africa
than in Europe and America, whose
populations descend largely from the
migrants of the world. It makes sense,
say these researchers, that world travel-
ers were more extroverted than those
who
stayed
home—and
that
they
passed on their traits to their children
and
their
children’s
children.
“As
96/929
personality traits are genetically trans-
mitted,” writes the psychologist Ken-
neth Olson, “each succeeding wave of
emigrants to a new continent would
give rise over time to a population of
more engaged individuals than reside
in the emigrants’ continent of origin.”
We can also trace our admiration of
extroverts to the Greeks, for whom
oratory was an exalted skill, and to the
Romans, for whom the worst possible
punishment was banishment from the
city, with its teeming social life. Simil-
arly, we revere our founding fathers
precisely
because
they
were
loud-
mouths on the subject of freedom: Give
me liberty or give me death! Even the
Christianity of early American religious
revivals, dating back to the First Great
Awakening of the eighteenth century,
depended on the showmanship of min-
isters who were considered successful if
97/929
they caused crowds of normally re-
served people to weep and shout and
generally lose their decorum. “Nothing
gives me more pain and distress than to
see a minister standing almost motion-
less, coldly plodding on as a mathem-
atician would calculate the distance of
the Moon from the Earth,” complained
a religious newspaper in 1837.
As this disdain suggests, early Amer-
icans revered action and were suspi-
cious of intellect, associating the life of
the mind with the languid, ineffectual
European aristocracy they had left be-
hind. The 1828 presidential campaign
pitted a former Harvard professor, John
Quincy Adams, against Andrew Jack-
son, a forceful military hero. A Jackson
campaign slogan tellingly distinguished
the two: “John Quincy Adams who can
write / And Andrew Jackson who can
fight.”
98/929
The victor of that campaign? The
fighter beat the writer, as the cultural
historian Neal Gabler puts it. (John
Quincy
Adams,
incidentally,
is
con-
sidered by political psychologists to be
one of the few introverts in presidential
history.)
But the rise of the Culture of Person-
ality intensified such biases, and ap-
plied them not only to political and re-
ligious
leaders,
but
also
to
regular
people. And though soap manufacturers
may have profited from the new em-
phasis on charm and charisma, not
everyone was pleased with this devel-
opment. “Respect for individual human
personality has with us reached its low-
est point,” observed one intellectual in
1921, “and it is delightfully ironical
that no nation is so constantly talking
about personality as we are. We actu-
ally have schools for ‘self-expression’
99/929
and
‘self-development,’
although
we
seem usually to mean the expression
and development of the personality of a
successful real estate agent.”
Another critic bemoaned the slavish
attention Americans were starting to
pay to entertainers: “It is remarkable
how
much
attention
the
stage
and
things pertaining to it are receiving
nowadays
from
the
magazines,”
he
grumbled.
Only
twenty
years
earli-
er—during the Culture of Character,
that is—such topics would have been
considered indecorous; now they had
become “such a large part of the life of
society that it has become a topic of
conversation among all classes.”
Even T. S. Eliot’s famous 1915 poem
The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock—in
which he laments the need to “prepare
a face to meet the faces that you
meet”—seems a cri de coeur about the
100/929
new
demands
of
self-presentation.
While poets of the previous century had
wandered lonely as a cloud through the
countryside (Wordsworth, in 1802) or
repaired in solitude to Walden Pond
(Thoreau, in 1845), Eliot’s Prufrock
mostly worries about being looked at
by “eyes that fix you in a formulated
phrase” and pin you, wriggling, to a
wall.
Fast-forward nearly a hundred years,
and Prufrock’s protest is enshrined in
high school syllabi, where it’s dutifully
memorized, then quickly forgotten, by
teens increasingly skilled at shaping
their own online and offline personae.
These students inhabit a world in which
status, income, and self-esteem depend
101/929
more than ever on the ability to meet
the demands of the Culture of Personal-
ity. The pressure to entertain, to sell
ourselves,
and
never
to
be
visibly
anxious keeps ratcheting up. The num-
ber of Americans who considered them-
selves shy increased from 40 percent in
the 1970s to 50 percent in the 1990s,
probably
because
we
measured
ourselves against ever higher standards
of
fearless
self-presentation.
“Social
anxiety
disorder”—which
essentially
means
pathological
shyness—is
now
thought to afflict nearly one in five of
us. The most recent version of the Dia-
gnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV),
the psychiatrist’s bible of mental dis-
orders, considers the fear of public
speaking to be a pathology—not an an-
noyance, not a disadvantage, but a dis-
ease—if it interferes with the sufferer’s
job performance. “It’s not enough,” one
102/929
senior manager at Eastman Kodak told
the author Daniel Goleman, “to be able
to sit at your computer excited about a
fantastic regression analysis if you’re
squeamish about presenting those res-
ults to an executive group.” (Appar-
ently it’s OK to be squeamish about do-
ing a regression analysis if you’re ex-
cited about giving speeches.)
But perhaps the best way to take the
measure of the twenty-first-century Cul-
ture of Personality is to return to the
self-help arena. Today, a full century
after Dale Carnegie launched that first
public-speaking
workshop
at
the
YMCA, his best-selling book How to Win
Friends and Influence People is a staple
of
airport
bookshelves
and
business
best-seller lists. The Dale Carnegie Insti-
tute still offers updated versions of
Carnegie’s original classes, and the abil-
ity to communicate fluidly remains a
103/929
core feature of the curriculum. Toast-
masters, the nonprofit organization es-
tablished in 1924 whose members meet
weekly to practice public speaking and
whose founder declared that “all talk-
ing is selling and all selling involves
talking,” is still thriving, with more
than 12,500 chapters in 113 countries.
The promotional video on Toastmas-
ters’ website features a skit in which
two colleagues, Eduardo and Sheila, sit
in the audience at the “Sixth Annual
Global
Business
Conference”
as
a
nervous speaker stumbles through a pi-
tiful presentation.
“I’m so glad I’m not him,” whispers
Eduardo.
“You’re joking, right?” replies Sheila
with a satisfied smile. “Don’t you re-
member last month’s sales presentation
to those new clients? I thought you
were going to faint.”
104/929
“I wasn’t that bad, was I?”
“Oh, you were that bad. Really bad.
Worse, even.”
Eduardo
looks
suitably
ashamed,
while
the
rather
insensitive
Sheila
seems oblivious.
“But,” says Sheila, “you can fix it.
You can do better.… Have you ever
heard of Toastmasters?”
Sheila, a young and attractive bru-
nette, hauls Eduardo to a Toastmasters
meeting. There she volunteers to per-
form an exercise called “Truth or Lie,”
in which she’s supposed to tell the
group of fifteen-odd participants a story
about her life, after which they decide
whether or not to believe her.
“I bet I can fool everyone,” she whis-
pers to Eduardo
sotto voce as she
marches to the podium. She spins an
elaborate tale about her years as an op-
era
singer,
concluding
with
her
105/929
poignant decision to give it all up to
spend more time with her family. When
she’s finished, the toastmaster of the
evening asks the group whether they
believe Sheila’s story. All hands in the
room go up. The toastmaster turns to
Sheila and asks whether it was true.
“I can’t
even carry a tune!”
she
beams triumphantly.
Sheila comes across as disingenuous,
but also oddly sympathetic. Like the
anxious readers of the 1920s personal-
ity guides, she’s only trying to get
ahead at the office. “There’s so much
competition in my work environment,”
she confides to the camera, “that it
makes it more important than ever to
keep my skills sharp.”
But what do “sharp skills” look like?
Should we become so proficient at self-
presentation
that
we
can
dissemble
without anyone suspecting? Must we
106/929
learn to stage-manage our voices, ges-
tures, and body language until we can
tell—sell—any story we want? These
seem venal aspirations, a marker of
how far we’ve come—and not in a good
way—since the days of Dale Carnegie’s
childhood.
Dale’s parents had high moral stand-
ards; they wanted their son to pursue a
career in religion or education, not
sales. It seems unlikely that they would
have approved of a self-improvement
technique called “Truth or Lie.” Or, for
that matter, of Carnegie’s best-selling
advice on how to get people to admire
you and do your bidding. How to Win
Friends and Influence People is full of
chapter titles like “Making People Glad
to Do What You Want” and “How to
Make People Like You Instantly.”
All of which raises the question, how
did we go from Character to Personality
107/929
without realizing that we had sacrificed
something meaningful along the way?

THE MYTH OF CHARISMATIC
LEADERSHIP
The Culture of Personality, a Hundred
Years Later
Society is itself an education in the extro-
vert values, and rarely has there been a
society that has preached them so hard.
No man is an island, but how John
Donne would writhe to hear how often,
and for what reasons, the thought is so
tiresomely repeated.
—WILLIAM WHYTE
Salesmanship as a Virtue: Live with
Tony Robbins
“Are you excited?” cries a young wo-
man named Stacy as I hand her my re-
gistration forms. Her honeyed voice
rises into one big exclamation point. I
nod and smile as brightly as I can.
Across the lobby of the Atlanta Conven-
tion Center, I hear people shrieking.
“What’s that noise?” I ask.
“They’re getting everyone pumped up
to go inside!” Stacy enthuses. “That’s
part of the whole UPW experience.”
She hands me a purple spiral binder
and
a
laminated
nametag
to
wear
around
my
neck.
UNLEASH
THE
POWER WITHIN, proclaims the binder
in big block letters. Welcome to Tony
Robbins’s entry-level seminar.
I’ve paid $895 in exchange, accord-
ing to the promotional materials, for
110/929
learning how to be more energetic, gain
momentum in my life, and conquer my
fears. But the truth is that I’m not here
to
unleash
the
power
within
me
(though I’m always happy to pick up a
few pointers); I’m here because this
seminar is the first stop on my journey
to understand the Extrovert Ideal.
I’ve seen Tony Robbins’s infomer-
cials—he claims that there’s always one
airing at any given moment—and he
strikes me as one of the more extrover-
ted people on earth. But he’s not just
any extrovert. He’s the king of self-help,
with a client roster that has included
President Clinton, Tiger Woods, Nelson
Mandela, Margaret Thatcher, Princess
Diana,
Mikhail
Gorbachev,
Mother
Teresa,
Serena
Williams,
Donna
Karan—and 50 million other people.
And the self-help industry, into which
hundreds of thousands of Americans
111/929
pour their hearts, souls, and some $11
billion a year, by definition reveals our
conception of the ideal self, the one we
aspire to become if only we follow the
seven principles of this and the three
laws of that. I want to know what this
ideal self looks like.
Stacy asks if I’ve brought my meals
with me. It seems a strange question:
Who carries supper with them from
New York City to Atlanta? She explains
that I’ll want to refuel at my seat; for
the
next
four
days,
Friday
through
Monday, we’ll be working fifteen hours
a day, 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., with
only one short afternoon break. Tony
will be onstage the entire time and I
won’t want to miss a moment.
I look around the lobby. Other people
seem to have come prepared—they’re
strolling toward the hall, cheerfully lug-
ging
grocery
bags
stuffed
with
112/929
PowerBars, bananas, and corn chips. I
pick up a couple of bruised apples from
the snack bar and make my way to the
auditorium. Greeters wearing UPW T-
shirts and ecstatic smiles line the en-
trance, springing up and down, fists
pumping. You can’t get inside without
slapping them five. I know, because I
try.
Inside the vast hall, a phalanx of dan-
cers is warming up the crowd to the
Billy Idol song “Mony Mony,” amplified
by a world-class sound system, magni-
fied on giant Megatron screens flanking
the stage.
They move in sync like
backup dancers in a Britney Spears
video, but are dressed like middle man-
agers. The lead performer is a fortyso-
mething balding fellow wearing a white
button-down
shirt,
conservative
tie,
rolled-up sleeves, and a great-to-meet-
you smile. The message seems to be
113/929
that we can all learn to be this exuber-
ant
when
we
get
to
work
every
morning.
Indeed, the dance moves are simple
enough for us to imitate at our seats:
jump and clap twice; clap to the left;
clap
to
the
right.
When
the
song
changes
to
“Gimme
Some
Lovin’,”
many in the audience climb atop their
metal folding chairs, where they contin-
ue to whoop and clap. I stand some-
what peevishly with arms crossed until
I decide that there’s nothing to be done
but join in and hop up and down along
with my seatmates.
Eventually
the
moment
we’ve
all
been waiting for arrives: Tony Robbins
bounds onstage. Already gigantic at six
feet seven inches, he looks a hundred
feet tall on the Megatron screen. He’s
movie-star handsome, with a head of
thick brown hair, a Pepsodent smile,
114/929
and
impossibly
defined
cheekbones.
EXPERIENCE TONY ROBBINS LIVE! the
seminar advertisement had promised,
and now here he is, dancing with the
euphoric crowd.
It’s about fifty degrees in the hall, but
Tony is wearing a short-sleeved polo
shirt and shorts. Many in the audience
have brought blankets with them, hav-
ing somehow known that the auditori-
um would be kept refrigerator-cold,
presumably
to
accommodate
Tony’s
high-octane metabolism. It would take
another Ice Age to cool this man off.
He’s leaping and beaming and man-
aging, somehow, to make eye contact
with all 3,800 of us. The greeters jump
rapturously in the aisles. Tony opens
his arms wide, embracing us all. If Je-
sus returned to Earth and made his first
stop at the Atlanta Convention Center,
115/929
it would be hard to imagine a more ju-
bilant reception.
This is true even in the back row
where I’m sitting with others who spent
only $895 for “general admission,” as
opposed to $2,500 for a “Diamond
Premiere Membership,” which gets you
a seat up front, as close to Tony as pos-
sible. When I bought my ticket over the
phone, the account rep advised me that
the people in the front rows—where
“you’re looking directly at Tony for
sure” instead of relying on the Megat-
ron—are generally “more successful in
life.” “Those are the people who have
more energy,” she advised. “Those are
the people who are screaming.” I have
no way of judging how successful the
people next to me are, but they cer-
tainly seem thrilled to be here. At the
sight of Tony, exquisitely stage-lit to set
116/929
off his expressive face, they cry out and
pour into the aisles rock-concert style.
Soon enough, I join them. I’ve always
loved to dance, and I have to admit
that gyrating en masse to Top 40 clas-
sics is an excellent way to pass the
time.
Unleashed
power
comes
from
high energy, according to Tony, and I
can see his point. No wonder people
travel from far and wide to see him in
person (there’s a lovely young woman
from
Ukraine
sitting—no,
leap-
ing—next
to
me
with
a
delighted
smile). I really must start doing aer-
obics again when I get back to New
York, I decide.
When the music finally stops, Tony ad-
dresses
us
in
a
raspy
voice,
half
117/929
Muppet, half bedroom-sexy, introdu-
cing his theory of “Practical Psycho-
logy.” The gist of it is that knowledge is
useless until it’s coupled with action.
He has a seductive, fast-talking delivery
that Willy Loman would have sighed
over. Demonstrating practical psycho-
logy in action, Tony instructs us to find
a partner and to greet each other as if
we feel inferior and scared of social re-
jection. I team up with a construction
worker from downtown Atlanta, and
we extend tentative handshakes, look-
ing bashfully at the ground as the song
“I Want You to Want Me” plays in the
background.
Then Tony calls out a series of art-
fully phrased questions:
“Was your breath full or shallow?”
“SHALLOW!” yells the audience in
unison.
118/929
“Did you hesitate or go straight to-
ward them?”
“HESITATE!”
“Was there tension in your body or
were you relaxed?”
“TENSION!”
Tony asks us to repeat the exercise,
but this time to greet our partners as if
the impression we make in the first
three to five seconds determines wheth-
er they’ll do business with us. If they
don’t, “everyone you care about will
die like pigs in hell.”
I’m startled by Tony’s emphasis on
business
success—this
is
a
seminar
about personal power, not sales. Then I
remember that Tony is not only a life
coach
but
also
a
businessman
ex-
traordinaire; he started his career in
sales and today serves as chairman of
seven privately held companies. Busi-
nessWeek once estimated his income at
119/929
$80 million a year. Now he seems to be
trying, with all the force of his mighty
personality, to impart his salesman’s
touch. He wants us not only to feel
great but to radiate waves of energy,
not just to be liked, but to be well liked;
he wants us to know how to sell
ourselves. I’ve already been advised by
the Anthony Robbins Companies, via a
personalized forty-five-page report gen-
erated by an online personality test that
I took in preparation for this weekend,
that “Susan” should work on her tend-
ency to tell, not sell, her ideas. (The re-
port was written in the third person, as
if it was to be reviewed by some ima-
ginary manager evaluating my people
skills.)
The
audience
divides
into
pairs
again,
enthusiastically
introducing
themselves and pumping their partners’
120/929
hands. When we’re finished, the ques-
tions repeat.
“Did that feel better, yes or no?”
“YES!”
“Did you use your body differently,
yes or no?”
“YES!”
“Did you use more muscles in your
face, yes or no?”
“YES!”
“Did you move straight toward them,
yes or no?”
“YES!”
This exercise seems designed to show
how our physiological state influences
our behavior and emotions, but it also
suggests
that
salesmanship
governs
even the most neutral interactions. It
implies that every encounter is a high-
stakes game in which we win or lose
the other person’s favor. It urges us to
meet social fear in as extroverted a
121/929
manner as possible. We must be vibrant
and confident, we must not seem hesit-
ant, we must smile so that our inter-
locutors will smile upon us. Taking
these steps will make us feel good—and
the better we feel, the better we can
sell ourselves.
Tony seems the perfect person to
demonstrate such skills. He strikes me
as having a “hyperthymic” tempera-
ment—a kind of extroversion-on-ster-
oids characterized, in the words of one
psychiatrist,
by
“exuberant,
upbeat,
overenergetic,
and
overconfident
lifelong traits” that have been recog-
nized as an asset in business, especially
sales. People with these traits often
make
wonderful
company,
as
Tony
does onstage.
But what if you admire the hyper-
thymic among us, but also like your
calm and thoughtful self? What if you
122/929
love knowledge for its own sake, not
necessarily as a blueprint to action?
What if you wish there were more, not
fewer, reflective types in the world?
Tony seems to have anticipated such
questions. “But I’m not an extrovert,
you say!” he told us at the start of the
seminar. “So? You don’t have to be an
extrovert to feel alive!”
True enough. But it seems, according
to Tony, that you’d better act like one if
you don’t want to flub the sales call and
watch your family die like pigs in hell.
The evening culminates with the Fire-
walk, one of the flagship moments of
the UPW seminar, in which we’re chal-
lenged to walk across a ten-foot bed of
coals without burning our feet. Many
123/929
people attend UPW because they’ve
heard about the Firewalk and want to
try it themselves. The idea is to propel
yourself into such a fearless state of
mind
that
you
can
withstand
even
1,200-degree heat.
Leading
up
to
that
moment,
we
spend
hours
practicing
Tony’s
tech-
niques—exercises, dance moves, visual-
izations. I notice that people in the
audience are starting to mimic Tony’s
every movement and facial expression,
including
his
signature
gesture
of
pumping his arm as if he were pitching
a baseball. The evening crescendoes un-
til finally, just before midnight, we
march to the parking lot in a torchlit
procession,
nearly
four
thousand
strong, chanting YES! YES! YES! to the
thump of a tribal beat. This seems to
electrify my fellow UPWers, but to me
this
drum-accompanied
chant—YES!
124/929
Ba-da-da-da,
YES!
Dum-dum-dum-
DUM, YES! Ba-da-da-da—sounds like
the sort of thing a Roman general
would stage to announce his arrival in
the city he’s about to sack. The greeters
who manned the gates to the auditori-
um earlier in the day with high fives
and bright smiles have morphed into
gatekeepers of the Firewalk, arms beck-
oning toward the bridge of flames.
As best I can tell, a successful Fire-
walk depends not so much on your
state of mind as on how thick the soles
of your feet happen to be, so I watch
from a safe distance. But I seem to be
the only one hanging back. Most of the
UPWers make it across, whooping as
they go.
“I did it!” they cry when they get to
the other side of the firepit. “I did it!”
125/929
They’ve entered a Tony Robbins state
of mind. But what exactly does this
consist of?
It is, first and foremost, a superior
mind—the antidote to Alfred Adler’s in-
feriority complex. Tony uses the word
power rather than superior (we’re too
sophisticated nowadays to frame our
quests for self-improvement in terms of
naked social positioning, the way we
did at the dawn of the Culture of Per-
sonality), but everything about him is
an exercise in superiority, from the way
he occasionally addresses the audience
as “girls and boys,” to the stories he
tells about his big houses and powerful
friends,
to
the
way
he
towers—literally—over the crowd. His
superhuman physical size is an import-
ant part of his brand; the title of his
best-selling
book,
Awaken
the
Giant
Within, says it all.
126/929
His
intellect
is
impressive,
too.
Though he believes university educa-
tions are overrated (because they don’t
teach you about your emotions and
your body, he says) and has been slow
to write his next book (because no one
reads anymore, according to Tony),
he’s managed to assimilate the work of
academic psychologists and package it
into one hell of a show, with genuine
insights the audience can make their
own.
Part of Tony’s genius lies in the un-
stated promise that he’ll let the audi-
ence share his own journey from inferi-
ority to superiority. He wasn’t always
so grand, he tells us. As a kid, he was a
shrimp. Before he got in shape, he was
overweight. And before he lived in a
castle in Del Mar, California, he rented
an apartment so small that he kept his
dishes in the bathtub. The implication
127/929
is that we can all get over whatever’s
keeping us down, that even introverts
can learn to walk on coals while belting
out a lusty YES.
The second part of the Tony state of
mind is good-heartedness. He wouldn’t
inspire so many people if he didn’t
make them feel that he truly cared
about
unleashing
the
power
within
each of them. When Tony’s onstage,
you get the sense that he’s singing, dan-
cing, and emoting with every ounce of
his energy and heart. There are mo-
ments, when the crowd is on its feet,
singing and dancing in unison, that you
can’t help but love him, the way many
people loved Barack Obama with a kind
of
shocked
delight
when
they
first
heard him talk about transcending red
and blue. At one point, Tony talks
about
the
different
needs
people
have—for love, certainty, variety, and
128/929
so on. He is motivated by love, he tells
us, and we believe him.
But there’s also this: throughout the
seminar, he constantly tries to “upsell”
us. He and his sales team use the UPW
event, whose attendees have already
paid a goodly sum, to market multi-day
seminars
with
even
more
alluring
names and stiffer price tags: Date with
Destiny,
about
$5,000;
Mastery
University,
about
$10,000;
and
the
Platinum Partnership, which, for a cool
$45,000 a year, buys you and eleven
other Platinum Partners the right to go
on exotic vacations with Tony.
During the afternoon break, Tony
lingers
onstage
with
his
blond
and
sweetly beautiful wife, Sage, gazing in-
to her eyes, caressing her hair, murmur-
ing into her ear. I’m happily married,
but right now Ken is in New York and
I’m here in Atlanta, and even I feel
129/929
lonely as I watch this spectacle. What
would it be like if I were single or un-
happily partnered? It would “arouse an
eager want” in me, just as Dale Carne-
gie advised salesmen to do with their
prospects so many years ago. And sure
enough, when the break is over, a
lengthy
video
comes
on
the
mega-
screen,
pitching
Tony’s
relationship-
building seminar.
In another brilliantly conceived seg-
ment, Tony devotes part of the seminar
to explaining the financial and emo-
tional benefits of surrounding oneself
with
the
right
“peer
group”—after
which a staffer begins a sales pitch for
the $45,000 Platinum program. Those
who purchase one of the twelve spots
will join the “ultimate peer group,” we
are told—the “cream of the crop,” the
“elite of the elite of the elite.”
130/929
I can’t help but wonder why none of
the other UPWers seem to mind, or
even to notice, these upselling tech-
niques. By now many of them have
shopping bags at their feet, full of stuff
they bought out in the lobby—DVDs,
books,
even
eight-by-ten
glossies
of
Tony himself, ready for framing.
But the thing about Tony—and what
draws people to buy his products—is
that like any good salesman, he believes
in what he’s pitching. He apparently
sees no contradiction between wanting
the best for people and wanting to live
in a mansion. He persuades us that he’s
using his sales skills not only for per-
sonal gain but also to help as many of
us as he can reach. Indeed, one very
thoughtful introvert I know, a success-
ful salesman who gives sales training
seminars of his own, swears that Tony
Robbins not only improved his business
131/929
but also made him a better person.
When he started attending events like
UPW, he says, he focused on who he
wanted to become, and now, when he
delivers his own seminars, he is that
person. “Tony gives me energy,” he
says, “and now I can create energy for
other people when I’m onstage.”
At the onset of the Culture of Personal-
ity, we were urged to develop an extro-
verted personality for frankly selfish
reasons—as a way of outshining the
crowd in a newly anonymous and com-
petitive society. But nowadays we tend
to think that becoming more extrover-
ted not only makes us more successful,
but also makes us better people. We see
132/929
salesmanship as a way of sharing one’s
gifts with the world.
This is why Tony’s zeal to sell to and
be adulated by thousands of people at
once is seen not as narcissism or huck-
sterism, but as leadership of the highest
order. If Abraham Lincoln was the em-
bodiment of virtue during the Culture
of Character, then Tony Robbins is his
counterpart during the Culture of Per-
sonality. Indeed, when Tony mentions
that he once thought of running for
president of the United States, the audi-
ence erupts in loud cheers.
But does it always make sense to
equate leadership with hyper-extrover-
sion? To find out, I visited Harvard
Business
School,
an
institution
that
prides itself on its ability to identify
and train some of the most prominent
business and political leaders of our
time.
133/929
The Myth of Charismatic Leadership:
Harvard Business School and Beyond
The first thing I notice about the Har-
vard Business School campus is the way
people walk. No one ambles, strolls, or
lingers. They stride, full of forward mo-
mentum. It’s crisp and autumnal the
week I visit, and the students’ bodies
seem to vibrate with September electri-
city as they advance across campus.
When they cross each other’s paths
they don’t merely nod—they exchange
animated
greetings,
inquiring
about
this one’s summer with J. P. Morgan or
that one’s trek in the Himalayas.
They behave the same way inside the
social hothouse of the Spangler Center,
the sumptuously decorated student cen-
ter. Spangler has floor-to-ceiling silk
curtains in sea-foam green, rich leather
sofas,
giant
Samsung
high-definition
134/929
TVs silently broadcasting campus news,
and
soaring
ceilings
festooned
with
high-wattage
chandeliers.
The
tables
and sofas are clustered mostly on the
perimeter
of
the
room,
forming
a
brightly lit center catwalk down which
the students breezily parade, seemingly
unaware that all eyes are on them. I ad-
mire their nonchalance.
The students are even better turned
out than their surroundings, if such a
thing is possible. No one is more than
five pounds overweight or has bad skin
or wears odd accessories. The women
are a cross between Head Cheerleader
and Most Likely to Succeed. They wear
fitted jeans, filmy blouses, and high-
heeled peekaboo-toed shoes that make
a pleasing clickety–clack on Spangler’s
polished wood floors. Some parade like
fashion models, except that they’re so-
cial and beaming instead of aloof and
135/929
impassive. The men are clean-cut and
athletic; they look like people who ex-
pect to be in charge, but in a friendly,
Eagle Scout sort of way. I have the feel-
ing that if you asked one of them for
driving directions, he’d greet you with
a can-do smile and throw himself into
the task of helping you to your destina-
tion—whether or not he knew the way.
I sit down next to a couple of stu-
dents who are in the middle of plan-
ning a road trip—HBS students are
forever coordinating pub crawls and
parties, or describing an extreme-travel
junket they’ve just come back from.
When they ask what brings me to cam-
pus, I say that I’m conducting inter-
views for a book about introversion and
extroversion. I don’t tell them that a
friend of mine, himself an HBS grad,
once called the place the “Spiritual
136/929
Capital of Extroversion.” But it turns
out that I don’t have to tell them.
“Good
luck
finding
an
introvert
around here,” says one.
“This school is predicated on extro-
version,” adds the other. “Your grades
and social status depend on it. It’s just
the norm here. Everyone around you is
speaking up and being social and going
out.”
“Isn’t there anyone on the quieter
side?” I ask.
They look at me curiously.
“I couldn’t tell you,” says the first
student dismissively.
Harvard Business School is not, by any
measure, an ordinary place. Founded in
1908, just when Dale Carnegie hit the
137/929
road as a traveling salesman and only
three years before he taught his first
class in public speaking, the school sees
itself as “educating leaders who make a
difference in the world.” President Ge-
orge W. Bush is a graduate, as are an
impressive collection of World Bank
presidents,
U.S. Treasury
secretaries,
New York City mayors, CEOs of com-
panies like General Electric, Goldman
Sachs, Procter & Gamble, and, more no-
toriously, Jeffrey Skilling, the villain of
the Enron scandal. Between 2004 and
2006, 20 percent of the top three exec-
utives at the Fortune 500 companies
were HBS grads.
HBS
grads
likely
have
influenced
your life in ways you’re not aware of.
They have decided who should go to
war and when; they have resolved the
fate of Detroit’s auto industry; they play
leading roles in just about every crisis
138/929
to shake Wall Street, Main Street, and
Pennsylvania Avenue. If you work in
corporate
America,
there’s
a
good
chance that Harvard Business School
grads have shaped your everyday life,
too, weighing in on how much privacy
you need in your workspace, how many
team-building sessions you need to at-
tend per year, and whether creativity is
best achieved through brainstorming or
solitude. Given the scope of their influ-
ence, it’s worth taking a look at who
enrolls here—and what they value by
the time they graduate.
The student who wishes me luck in
finding an introvert at HBS no doubt
believes that there are none to be
found. But clearly he doesn’t know his
first-year classmate Don Chen. I first
meet
Don
in
Spangler,
where
he’s
seated only a few couches away from
the road-trip planners. He comes across
139/929
as a typical HBS student, tall, with gra-
cious manners, prominent cheekbones,
a winsome smile, and a fashionably
choppy, surfer-dude haircut. He’d like
to find a job in private equity when he
graduates. But talk to Don for a while
and you’ll notice that his voice is softer
than those of his classmates, his head
ever so slightly cocked, his grin a little
tentative. Don is “a bitter introvert,” as
he cheerfully puts it—bitter because the
more time he spends at HBS, the more
convinced he becomes that he’d better
change his ways.
Don likes having a lot of time to him-
self, but that’s not much of an option at
HBS. His day begins early in the morn-
ing, when he meets for an hour and a
half with his “Learning Team”—a pre-
assigned study group in which particip-
ation is mandatory (students at HBS
practically
go
to
the
bathroom
in
140/929
teams). He spends the rest of the morn-
ing in class, where ninety students sit
together in a wood-paneled, U-shaped
amphitheater with stadium seating. The
professor usually kicks off by directing
a student to describe the case study of
the day, which is based on a real-life
business scenario—say, a CEO who’s
considering
changing
her
company’s
salary structure. The figure at the heart
of the case study, in this case the CEO,
is referred to as the “protagonist.” If
you were the protagonist, the professor
asks—and soon you will be, is the im-
plication—what would you do?
The essence of the HBS education is
that leaders have to act confidently and
make decisions in the face of incom-
plete information. The teaching method
plays with an age-old question: If you
don’t have all the facts—and often you
won’t—should you wait to act until
141/929
you’ve collected as much data as pos-
sible? Or, by hesitating, do you risk los-
ing others’ trust and your own mo-
mentum? The answer isn’t obvious. If
you speak firmly on the basis of bad in-
formation, you can lead your people in-
to disaster. But if you exude uncer-
tainty,
then
morale
suffers,
funders
won’t invest, and your organization can
collapse.
The HBS teaching method implicitly
comes down on the side of certainty.
The CEO may not know the best way
forward, but she has to act anyway.
The HBS students, in turn, are expected
to opine. Ideally, the student who was
just cold-called has already discussed
the case study with his Learning Team,
so he’s ready to hold forth on the prot-
agonist’s best moves. After he finishes,
the professor encourages other students
to offer their own views. Half of the
142/929
students’ grade, and a much larger per-
centage of their social status, is based
on whether they throw themselves into
this fray. If a student talks often and
forcefully, then he’s a player; if he
doesn’t, he’s on the margins.
Many of the students adapt easily to
this
system.
But
not
Don.
He
has
trouble elbowing his way into class dis-
cussions; in some classes he barely
speaks at all. He prefers to contribute
only
when
he
believes
he
has
something insightful to add, or honest-
to-God disagrees with someone. This
sounds reasonable, but Don feels as if
he should be more comfortable talking
just so he can fill up his share of avail-
able airtime.
Don’s HBS friends, who tend to be
thoughtful, reflective types like him,
spend a lot of time talking about talk-
ing
in
class.
How
much
class
143/929
participation is too much? How little is
too little? When does publicly disagree-
ing with a classmate constitute healthy
debate, and when does it seem compet-
itive and judgmental? One of Don’s
friends is worried because her professor
sent around an e-mail saying that any-
one with real-world experience on the
day’s case study should let him know in
advance. She’s sure that the professor’s
announcement was an effort to limit
stupid remarks like the one she made in
class last week. Another worries that
he’s not loud enough. “I just have a nat-
urally soft voice,” he says, “so when my
voice sounds normal to others, I feel
like I’m shouting. I have to work on it.”
The school also tries hard to turn
quiet students into talkers. The profess-
ors have their own “Learning Teams,”
in which they egg each other on with
techniques
to
draw
out
reticent
144/929
students. When students fail to speak
up in class, it’s seen not only as their
own deficit but also as their professor’s.
“If someone doesn’t speak by the end of
the semester, it’s problematic,” Profess-
or Michel Anteby told me. “It means I
didn’t do a good job.”
The school even hosts live informa-
tional sessions and web pages on how
to be a good class participator. Don’s
friends earnestly reel off the tips they
remember best.
“Speak with conviction. Even if you
believe something only fifty-five per-
cent, say it as if you believe it a hun-
dred percent.”
“If you’re preparing alone for class,
then you’re doing it wrong. Nothing at
HBS is intended to be done alone.”
“Don’t think about the perfect an-
swer. It’s better to get out there and say
145/929
something than to never get your voice
in.”
The school newspaper, The Harbus,
also dispenses advice, featuring articles
with titles like “How to Think and
Speak Well—On the Spot!,” “Develop-
ing Your Stage Presence,” and “Arrog-
ant or Simply Confident?”
These imperatives extend beyond the
classroom. After class, most people eat
lunch
at
the
Spangler
dining
hall,
which one grad describes as “more like
high school than high school.” And
every day, Don wrestles with himself.
Should he go back to his apartment and
recharge over a quiet lunch, as he longs
to do, or join his classmates? Even if he
forces himself to go to Spangler, it’s not
as if the social pressure will end there.
As the day wears on, there will be more
such dilemmas. Attend the late-after-
noon happy hours? Head out for a late,
146/929
rowdy evening? Students at HBS go out
in big groups several nights a week,
says Don. Participation isn’t mandatory,
but it feels as if it is to those who don’t
thrive on group activities.
“Socializing
here
is
an
extreme
sport,” one of Don’s friends tells me.
“People go out all the time. If you don’t
go out one night, the next day people
will ask, ‘Where were you?’ I go out at
night like it’s my job.” Don has noticed
that the people who organize social
events—happy hours, dinners, drinking
fests—are at the top of the social hier-
archy. “The professors tell us that our
classmates are the people who will go
to our weddings,” says Don. “If you
leave HBS without having built an ex-
tensive social network, it’s like you
failed your HBS experience.”
By the time Don falls into bed at
night, he’s exhausted. And sometimes
147/929
he wonders why, exactly, he should
have to work so hard at being outgoing.
Don is Chinese-American, and recently
he worked a summer job in China. He
was struck by how different the social
norms were, and how much more com-
fortable he felt. In China there was
more emphasis on listening, on asking
questions rather than holding forth, on
putting others’ needs first. In the United
States, he feels, conversation is about
how effective you are at turning your
experiences
into
stories,
whereas
a
Chinese
person
might
be
concerned
with taking up too much of the other
person’s
time
with
inconsequential
information.
“That summer, I said to myself, ‘Now
I know why these are my people,’ ” he
says.
But that was China, this is Cam-
bridge,
Massachusetts.
And
if
one
148/929
judges HBS by how well it prepares stu-
dents for the “real world,” it seems to
be doing an excellent job. After all, Don
Chen will graduate into a business cul-
ture in which verbal fluency and soci-
ability are the two most important pre-
dictors of success, according to a Stan-
ford Business School study. It’s a world
in which a middle manager at GE once
told me that “people here don’t even
want to meet with you if you don’t
have a PowerPoint and a ‘pitch’ for
them. Even if you’re just making a re-
commendation to your colleague, you
can’t sit down in someone’s office and
tell them what you think. You have to
make a presentation, with pros and
cons and a ‘takeaway box.’ ”
Unless they’re self-employed or able
to telecommute, many adults work in
offices where they must take care to
glide down the corridors greeting their
149/929
colleagues
warmly
and
confidently.
“The business world,” says a 2006 art-
icle from the Wharton Program for
Working Professionals, “is filled with
office environments similar to one de-
scribed by an Atlanta area corporate
trainer: ‘Here everyone knows that it’s
important
to
be
an
extrovert
and
troublesome
to
be
an
introvert.
So
people work real hard at looking like
extroverts, whether that’s comfortable
or not. It’s like making sure you drink
the same single-malt scotch the CEO
drinks and that you work out at the
right health club.’ ”
Even businesses that employ many
artists, designers, and other imaginative
types often display a preference for ex-
troversion. “We want to attract creative
people,”
the
director
of
human
re-
sources at a major media company told
me. When I asked what she meant by
150/929
“creative,” she answered without miss-
ing a beat. “You have to be outgoing,
fun, and jazzed up to work here.”
Contemporary
ads
aimed
at

nesspeople would give the Williams
Luxury
Shaving

ads
of
yes-
teryear a run for their money. One line
of TV commercials that ran on CNBC,
the cable business channel, featured an
office worker losing out on a plum
assignment.
BOSS TO TED AND ALICE. Ted, I’m
sending Alice to the sales confer-
ence because she thinks faster on
her feet than you.
TED. (speechless) …
BOSS. So, Alice, we’ll send you on
Thursday—
TED. She does not!
151/929
Other
ads
explicitly
sell
their
products as extroversion-enhancers. In
2000, Amtrak encouraged travelers to
“DEPART FROM YOUR INHIBITIONS.” Nike be-
came a prominent brand partly on the
strength of its “Just Do It” campaign.
And in 1999 and 2000, a series of ads
for the psychotropic drug Paxil prom-
ised to cure the extreme shyness known
as “social anxiety disorder” by offering
Cinderella stories of personality trans-
formation. One Paxil ad showed a well-
dressed executive shaking hands over a
business deal. “I can taste success,”
read the caption. Another showed what
happens without the drug: a business-
man alone in his office, his forehead
resting dejectedly on a clenched fist. “I
should have joined in more often,” it
read.
152/929
Yet even at Harvard Business School
there are signs that something might be
wrong with a leadership style that val-
ues quick and assertive answers over
quiet, slow decision-making.
Every autumn the incoming class par-
ticipates in an elaborate role-playing
game called the Subarctic Survival Situ-
ation. “It is approximately 2:30 p.m.,
October 5,” the students are told, “and
you have just crash-landed in a float
plane on the east shore of Laura Lake in
the subarctic region of the northern
Quebec-Newfoundland
border.”
The
students are divided into small groups
and asked to imagine that their group
has salvaged fifteen items from the
plane—a compass, sleeping bag, axe,
and so on. Then they’re told to rank
153/929
them in order of importance to the
group’s survival. First the students rank
the items individually; then they do so
as a team. Next they score those rank-
ings against an expert’s to see how well
they did. Finally they watch a video-
tape of their team’s discussions to see
what went right—or wrong.
The point of the exercise is to teach
group
synergy.
Successful
synergy
means a higher ranking for the team
than for its individual members. The
group fails when any of its members
has a better ranking than the overall
team. And failure is exactly what can
happen when students prize assertive-
ness too highly.
One of Don’s classmates was in a
group lucky to include a young man
with extensive experience in the north-
ern backwoods. He had a lot of good
ideas about how to rank the fifteen
154/929
salvaged items. But his group didn’t
listen, because he expressed his views
too quietly.
“Our action plan hinged on what the
most vocal people suggested,” recalls
the classmate. “When the less vocal
people put out ideas, those ideas were
discarded. The ideas that were rejected
would have kept us alive and out of
trouble, but they were dismissed be-
cause of the conviction with which the
more
vocal
people
suggested
their
ideas. Afterwards they played us back
the
videotape,
and
it
was
so
embarrassing.”
The Subarctic Survival Situation may
sound like a harmless game played in-
side the ivory tower, but if you think of
meetings
you’ve
attended,
you
can
probably
recall
a
time—plenty
of
times—when the opinion of the most
dynamic or talkative person prevailed
155/929
to the detriment of all. Perhaps it was a
low-stakes
situation—your
PTA,
say,
deciding whether to meet on Monday
or Tuesday nights. But maybe it was
important: an emergency meeting of
Enron’s top brass, considering whether
or not to disclose questionable account-
ing practices. (See chapter 7 for more
on
Enron.)
Or
a
jury
deliberating
whether or not to send a single mother
to jail.
I discussed the Subarctic Survival
Situation with HBS professor Quinn
Mills, an expert on leadership styles.
Mills is a courteous man dressed, on the
day we met, in a pinstriped suit and
yellow polka-dot tie. He has a sonorous
voice, and uses it skillfully. The HBS
method “presumes that leaders should
be vocal,” he told me flat out, “and in
my view that’s part of reality.”
156/929
But Mills also pointed to the common
phenomenon known as the “winner’s
curse,” in which two companies bid
competitively to acquire a third, until
the price climbs so high that it becomes
less an economic activity than a war of
egos.
The
winning
bidders
will
be
damned if they’ll let their opponents
get the prize, so they buy the target
company at an inflated price. “It tends
to be the assertive people who carry the
day in these kinds of things,” says Mills.
“You see this all the time. People ask,
‘How did this happen, how did we pay
so much?’ Usually it’s said that they
were carried away by the situation, but
that’s not right. Usually they’re carried
away by people who are assertive and
domineering. The risk with our stu-
dents is that they’re very good at get-
ting their way. But that doesn’t mean
they’re going the right way.”
157/929
If we assume that quiet and loud
people have roughly the same number
of
good
(and
bad)
ideas,
then
we
should worry if the louder and more
forceful people always carry the day.
This would mean that an awful lot of
bad ideas prevail while good ones get
squashed. Yet studies in group dynam-
ics suggest that this is exactly what
happens. We perceive talkers as smarter
than quiet types—even though grade-
point averages and SAT and intelli-
gence test scores reveal this perception
to be inaccurate. In one experiment in
which
two
strangers
met
over
the
phone, those who spoke more were
considered
more
intelligent,
better
looking, and more likable. We also see
talkers as leaders. The more a person
talks, the more other group members
direct their attention to him, which
means that he becomes increasingly
158/929
powerful as a meeting goes on. It also
helps to speak fast; we rate quick talk-
ers as more capable and appealing than
slow talkers.
All of this would be fine if more talk-
ing were correlated with greater in-
sight, but research suggests that there’s
no such link. In one study, groups of
college students were asked to solve
math problems together and then to
rate
one
another’s
intelligence
and
judgment. The students who spoke first
and most often were consistently given
the highest ratings, even though their
suggestions
(and
math
SAT
scores)
were no better than those of the less
talkative students. These same students
were given similarly high ratings for
their creativity and analytical powers
during a separate exercise to develop a
business
strategy
for
a
start-up
company.
159/929
A well-known study out of UC Berke-
ley by organizational behavior profess-
or Philip Tetlock found that television
pundits—that is, people who earn their
livings by holding forth confidently on
the basis of limited information—make
worse predictions about political and
economic trends than they would by
random chance. And the very worst
prognosticators tend to be the most
famous and the most confident—the
very ones who would be considered
natural leaders in an HBS classroom.
The U.S. Army has a name for a sim-
ilar phenomenon: “the Bus to Abilene.”
“Any army officer can tell you what
that means,” Colonel (Ret.) Stephen J.
Gerras, a professor of behavioral sci-
ences at the U.S. Army War College,
told Yale Alumni Magazine in 2008. “It’s
about a family sitting on a porch in
Texas
on
a
hot
summer
day,
and
160/929
somebody says, ‘I’m bored. Why don’t
we go to Abilene?’ When they get to
Abilene, somebody says, ‘You know, I
didn’t really want to go.’ And the next
person says, ‘I didn’t want to go—I
thought you wanted to go,’ and so on.
Whenever you’re in an army group and
somebody says, ‘I think we’re all get-
ting on the bus to Abilene here,’ that is
a red flag. You can stop a conversation
with it. It is a very powerful artifact of
our culture.”
The “Bus to Abilene” anecdote re-
veals our tendency to follow those who
initiate action—any action. We are sim-
ilarly inclined to empower dynamic
speakers. One highly successful venture
capitalist who is regularly pitched by
young entrepreneurs told me how frus-
trated he is by his colleagues’ failure to
distinguish between good presentation
skills and true leadership ability. “I
161/929
worry that there are people who are
put in positions of authority because
they’re good talkers, but they don’t
have good ideas,” he said. “It’s so easy
to confuse schmoozing ability with tal-
ent.
Someone
seems
like
a
good
presenter, easy to get along with, and
those traits are rewarded. Well, why is
that? They’re valuable traits, but we
put too much of a premium on present-
ing and not enough on substance and
critical thinking.”
In his book Iconoclast, the neuroe-
conomist Gregory Berns explores what
happens when companies rely too heav-
ily on presentation skills to weed out
good ideas from nonstarters. He de-
scribes a software company called Rite-
Solutions that successfully asks employ-
ees to share ideas through an online
“idea market,” as a way of focusing on
substance rather than style. Joe Marino,
162/929
president of Rite-Solutions, and Jim La-
voie, CEO of the company, created this
system as a reaction to problems they’d
experienced elsewhere. “In my old com-
pany,” Lavoie told Berns, “if you had a
great idea, we would tell you, ‘OK,
we’ll make an appointment for you to
address the murder board’ ”—a group
of people charged with vetting new
ideas. Marino described what happened
next:
Some technical guy comes in with a
good idea. Of course questions are
asked of that person that they don’t
know. Like, “How big’s the market?
What’s your marketing approach?
What’s your business plan for this?
What’s the product going to cost?”
It’s embarrassing. Most people can’t
answer those kinds of questions. The
people who made it through these
163/929
boards were not the people with the
best
ideas.
They
were
the
best
presenters.
Contrary
to
the
Harvard
Business
School model of vocal leadership, the
ranks of effective CEOs turn out to be
filled with introverts, including Charles
Schwab; Bill Gates; Brenda Barnes, CEO
of
Sara
Lee;
and
James
Copeland,
former
CEO
of
Deloitte
Touche
Tohmatsu. “Among the most effective
leaders I have encountered and worked
with in half a century,” the manage-
ment guru Peter Drucker has written,
“some locked themselves into their of-
fice and others were ultra-gregarious.
Some were quick and impulsive, while
others studied the situation and took
forever to come to a decision.… The
one and only personality trait the ef-
fective ones I have encountered did
164/929
have in common was something they
did not have: they had little or no ‘cha-
risma’ and little use either for the term
or what it signifies.” Supporting Druck-
er’s claim, Brigham Young University
management
professor
Bradley
Agle
studied the CEOs of 128 major compan-
ies and found that those considered
charismatic by their top executives had
bigger salaries but not better corporate
performance.
We tend to overestimate how outgo-
ing leaders need to be. “Most leading in
a corporation is done in small meetings
and it’s done at a distance, through
written
and
video
communications,”
Professor Mills told me. “It’s not done
in front of big groups. You have to be
able to do some of that; you can’t be a
leader of a corporation and walk into a
room full of analysts and turn white
with fear and leave. But you don’t have
165/929
to do a whole lot of it. I’ve known a lot
of
leaders
of
corporations
who
are
highly
introspective
and
who
really
have to make themselves work to do
the public stuff.”
Mills points to Lou Gerstner, the le-
gendary chairman of IBM. “He went to
school here,” he says. “I don’t know
how he’d characterize himself. He has
to give big speeches, and he does, and
he looks calm. But my sense is that he’s
dramatically more comfortable in small
groups. Many of these guys are, actu-
ally. Not all of them. But an awful lot of
them.”
Indeed, according to a famous study
by the influential management theorist
Jim Collins, many of the best-perform-
ing companies of the late twentieth
century were run by what he calls
“Level 5 Leaders.” These exceptional
CEOs were known not for their flash or
166/929
charisma
but
for
extreme
humility
coupled with intense professional will.
In his influential book Good to Great,
Collins tells the story of Darwin Smith,
who in his twenty years as head of
Kimberly-Clark turned it into the lead-
ing paper company in the world and
generated stock returns more than four
times higher than the market average.
Smith was a shy and mild-mannered
man who wore J.C. Penney suits and
nerdy black-rimmed glasses, and spent
his vacations puttering around his Wis-
consin farm by himself. Asked by a
Wall Street Journal reporter to describe
his
management
style,
Smith
stared
back for an uncomfortably long time
and answered with a single word: “Ec-
centric.” But his soft demeanor con-
cealed a fierce resolve. Soon after being
appointed CEO, Smith made a dramatic
decision to sell the mills that produced
167/929
the company’s core business of coated
paper
and
invest
instead
in
the
consumer-paper-products
industry,
which he believed had better econom-
ics and a brighter future. Everyone said
this was a huge mistake, and Wall
Street
downgraded
Kimberly-Clark’s
stock.
But
Smith,
unmoved
by
the
crowd, did what he thought was right.
As a result, the company grew stronger
and soon outpaced its rivals. Asked
later about his strategy, Smith replied
that he never stopped trying to become
qualified for the job.
Collins hadn’t set out to make a point
about quiet leadership. When he started
his research, all he wanted to know was
what characteristics made a company
outperform its competition. He selected
eleven standout companies to research
in depth. Initially he ignored the ques-
tion of leadership altogether, because
168/929
he wanted to avoid simplistic answers.
But
when
he
analyzed
what
the
highest-performing companies had in
common,
the
nature
of
their
CEOs
jumped out at him. Every single one of
them was led by an unassuming man like
Darwin Smith. Those who worked with
these leaders tended to describe them
with
the
following
words:
quiet,
humble,
modest,
reserved,
shy,
gracious, mild-mannered, self-effacing,
understated.
The lesson, says Collins, is clear. We
don’t need giant personalities to trans-
form companies. We need leaders who
build not their own egos but the institu-
tions they run.
169/929
So what do introverted leaders do dif-
ferently from—and sometimes better
than—extroverts?
One answer comes from the work of
Wharton management professor Adam
Grant, who has spent considerable time
consulting with Fortune 500 executives
and military leaders—from Google to
the U.S. Army and Navy. When we first
spoke, Grant was teaching at the Ross
School of Business at the University of
Michigan,
where
he’d
become
con-
vinced that the existing research, which
showed a correlation between extrover-
sion
and
leadership,
didn’t
tell
the
whole story.
Grant told me about a wing com-
mander in the U.S. Air Force—one rank
below general, in command of thou-
sands of people, charged with protect-
ing a high-security missile base—who
was
one
of
the
most
classically
170/929
introverted people, as well as one of the
finest leaders, Grant had ever met. This
man lost focus when he interacted too
much with people, so he carved out
time for thinking and recharging. He
spoke quietly, without much variation
in his vocal inflections or facial expres-
sions. He was more interested in listen-
ing and gathering information than in
asserting his opinion or dominating a
conversation.
He was also widely admired; when
he spoke, everyone listened. This was
not necessarily remarkable—if you’re at
the
top
of
the
military
hierarchy,
people are supposed to listen to you.
But in the case of this commander, says
Grant, people respected not just his
formal authority, but also the way he
led: by supporting his employees’ ef-
forts to take the initiative. He gave sub-
ordinates
input
into
key
decisions,
171/929
implementing
the
ideas
that
made
sense, while making it clear that he had
the
final
authority.
He
wasn’t
con-
cerned with getting credit or even with
being in charge; he simply assigned
work to those who could perform it
best. This meant delegating some of his
most interesting, meaningful, and im-
portant tasks—work that other leaders
would have kept for themselves.
Why did the research not reflect the
talents of people like the wing com-
mander? Grant thought he knew what
the problem was. First, when he looked
closely at the existing studies on per-
sonality and leadership, he found that
the correlation between extroversion
and leadership was modest. Second,
these
studies
were
often
based
on
people’s perceptions of who made a
good
leader,
as
opposed
to
actual
172/929
results. And personal opinions are often
a simple reflection of cultural bias.
But most intriguing to Grant was that
the existing research didn’t differentiate
among the various kinds of situations a
leader might face. It might be that cer-
tain organizations or contexts were bet-
ter
suited
to
introverted
leadership
styles, he thought, and others to extro-
verted
approaches,
but
the
studies
didn’t make such distinctions.
Grant
had
a
theory
about
which
kinds of circumstances would call for
introverted leadership. His hypothesis
was that extroverted leaders enhance
group
performance
when
employees
are passive, but that introverted leaders
are more effective with proactive em-
ployees. To test his idea, he and two
colleagues, professors Francesca Gino
of Harvard Business School and David
Hofman of the Kenan-Flagler Business
173/929
School at the University of North Caro-
lina, carried out a pair of studies of
their own.
In the first study, Grant and his col-
leagues analyzed data from one of the
five biggest pizza chains in the United
States. They discovered that the weekly
profits of the stores managed by extro-
verts were 16 percent higher than the
profits of those led by introverts—but
only when the employees were passive
types
who
tended
to
do
their
job
without exercising initiative. Introverted
leaders had the exact opposite results.
When
they
worked
with
employees
who actively tried to improve work
procedures, their stores outperformed
those led by extroverts by more than 14
percent.
In the second study, Grant’s team di-
vided 163 college students into compet-
ing teams charged with folding as many
174/929
T-shirts as possible in ten minutes. Un-
beknownst to the participants, each
team
included
two
actors.
In
some
teams, the two actors acted passively,
following the leader’s instructions. In
other teams, one of the actors said, “I
wonder if there’s a more efficient way
to do this.” The other actor replied that
he had a friend from Japan who had a
faster way to fold shirts. “It might take
a minute or two to teach you,” the act-
or told the leader, “but do we want to
try it?”
The results were striking. The intro-
verted leaders were 20 percent more
likely to follow the suggestion—and
their teams had 24 percent better res-
ults than the teams of the extroverted
leaders. When the followers were not
proactive, though—when they simply
did as the leader instructed without
suggesting
their
own
shirt-folding
175/929
methods—the teams led by extroverts
outperformed those led by the intro-
verts by 22 percent.
Why did these leaders’ effectiveness
turn on whether their employees were
passive
or
proactive?
Grant
says
it
makes
sense
that
introverts
are
uniquely
good
at
leading
initiative-
takers. Because of their inclination to
listen to others and lack of interest in
dominating social situations, introverts
are more likely to hear and implement
suggestions. Having benefited from the
talents of their followers, they are then
likely to motivate them to be even
more proactive. Introverted leaders cre-
ate a virtuous circle of proactivity, in
other
words.
In
the
T-shirt-folding
study, the team members reported per-
ceiving the introverted leaders as more
open
and
receptive
to
their
ideas,
176/929
which motivated them to work harder
and to fold more shirts.
Extroverts, on the other hand, can be
so intent on putting their own stamp on
events that they risk losing others’ good
ideas along the way and allowing work-
ers to lapse into passivity. “Often the
leaders end up doing a lot of the talk-
ing,” says Francesca Gino, “and not
listening to any of the ideas that the
followers are trying to provide.” But
with their natural ability to inspire, ex-
troverted leaders are better at getting
results from more passive workers.
This line of research is still in its in-
fancy.
But
under
the
auspices
of
Grant—an especially proactive fellow
himself—it may grow quickly. (One of
his colleagues has described Grant as
the kind of person who “can make
things happen twenty-eight minutes be-
fore they’re scheduled to begin.”) Grant
177/929
is especially excited about the implica-
tions of these findings because proact-
ive employees who take advantage of
opportunities in a fast-moving, 24/7
business environment, without waiting
for a leader to tell them what to do, are
increasingly vital to organizational suc-
cess. To understand how to maximize
these employees’ contributions is an
important tool for all leaders. It’s also
important
for
companies
to
groom
listeners as well as talkers for leader-
ship roles.
The popular press, says Grant, is full
of suggestions that introverted leaders
practice their public speaking skills and
smile more. But Grant’s research sug-
gests that in at least one important re-
gard—encouraging employees to take
initiative—introverted
leaders
would
do well to go on doing what they do
naturally. Extroverted leaders, on the
178/929
other hand, “may wish to adopt a more
reserved,
quiet
style,”
Grant
writes.
They may want to learn to sit down so
that others might stand up.
Which is just what a woman named
Rosa Parks did naturally.
For years before the day in December
1955 when Rosa Parks refused to give
up her seat on a Montgomery bus, she
worked
behind
the
scenes
for
the
NAACP, even receiving training in non-
violent resistance. Many things had in-
spired her political commitment. The
time the Ku Klux Klan marched in front
of her childhood house. The time her
brother, a private in the U.S. Army
who’d saved the lives of white soldiers,
came home from World War II only to
179/929
be
spat
upon.
The
time
a
black
eighteen-year-old
delivery
boy
was
framed for rape and sent to the electric
chair. Parks organized NAACP records,
kept track of membership payments,
read to little kids in her neighborhood.
She was diligent and honorable, but no
one thought of her as a leader. Parks, it
seemed, was more of a foot soldier.
Not many people know that twelve
years before her showdown with the
Montgomery bus driver, she’d had an-
other encounter with the same man,
possibly on the very same bus. It was a
November afternoon in 1943, and Parks
had entered through the front door of
the
bus
because
the
back
was
too
crowded. The driver, a well-known big-
ot named James Blake, told her to use
the rear and started to push her off the
bus. Parks asked him not to touch her.
She would leave on her own, she said
180/929
quietly.
“Get
off
my
bus,”
Blake
sputtered in response.
Parks complied, but not before delib-
erately dropping her purse on her way
out and sitting on a “white” seat as she
picked it up. “Intuitively, she had en-
gaged in an act of passive resistance, a
precept named by Leo Tolstoy and em-
braced by Mahatma Gandhi,” writes the
historian Douglas Brinkley in a wonder-
ful biography of Parks. It was more
than a decade before King popularized
the idea of nonviolence and long before
Parks’s own training in civil disobedi-
ence, but, Brinkley writes, “such prin-
ciples were a perfect match for her own
personality.”
Parks was so disgusted by Blake that
she refused to ride his bus for the next
twelve years. On the day she finally
did, the day that turned her into the
“Mother of the Civil Rights Movement,”
181/929
she got back on that bus, according to
Brinkley,
only
out
of
sheer
absentmindedness.
Parks’s actions that day were brave
and singular, but it was in the legal fal-
lout that her quiet strength truly shone.
Local civil rights leaders sought her out
as a test case to challenge the city’s bus
laws, pressing her to file a lawsuit. This
was no small decision. Parks had a
sickly mother who depended on her; to
sue would mean losing her job and her
husband’s. It would mean running the
very real risk of being lynched from
“the tallest telephone pole in town,” as
her husband and mother put it. “Rosa,
the white folks will kill you,” pleaded
her husband. “It was one thing to be ar-
rested for an isolated bus incident,”
writes Brinkley; “it was quite another,
as historian Taylor Branch would put it,
182/929
to
‘reenter
that
forbidden
zone
by
choice.’ ”
But because of her nature, Parks was
the perfect plaintiff. Not only because
she was a devout Christian, not only
because she was an upstanding citizen,
but
also
because
she
was
gentle.
“They’ve messed with the wrong one
now!” the boycotters would declare as
they traipsed miles to work and school.
The phrase became a rallying cry. Its
power lay in how paradoxical it was.
Usually
such
a
phrase
implies
that
you’ve messed with a local heavy, with
some bullying giant. But it was Parks’s
quiet strength that made her unassail-
able. “The slogan served as a reminder
that the woman who had inspired the
boycott was the sort of soft-spoken
martyr God would not abandon,” writes

Parks took her time coming to a de-
cision, but ultimately agreed to sue. She
also lent her presence at a rally held on
the evening of her trial, the night when
a young Martin Luther King Jr., the
head of the brand-new Montgomery Im-
provement Association, roused all of
Montgomery’s black community to boy-
cott the buses. “Since it had to hap-
pen,” King told the crowd, “I’m happy
it happened to a person like Rosa Parks,
for nobody can doubt the boundless
outreach of her integrity. Nobody can
doubt the height of her character. Mrs.
Parks is unassuming, and yet there is
integrity and character there.”
Later that year Parks agreed to go on
a fund-raising speaking tour with King
and
other
civil
rights
leaders.
She
suffered insomnia, ulcers, and home-
sickness along the way. She met her
idol, Eleanor Roosevelt, who wrote of
184/929
their
encounter
in
her
newspaper
column: “She is a very quiet, gentle
person and it is difficult to imagine
how she ever could take such a positive
and independent stand.” When the boy-
cott finally ended, over a year later, the
buses integrated by decree of the Su-
preme Court, Parks was overlooked by
the press. The New York Times ran two
front-page stories that celebrated King
but didn’t mention her. Other papers
photographed the boycott leaders sit-
ting in front of buses, but Parks was not
invited to sit for these pictures. She
didn’t mind. On the day the buses were
integrated, she preferred to stay home
and take care of her mother.
185/929
Parks’s story is a vivid reminder that
we have been graced with limelight-
avoiding
leaders
throughout
history.
Moses, for example, was not, according
to some interpretations of his story, the
brash, talkative type who would organ-
ize road trips and hold forth in a
classroom at Harvard Business School.
On the contrary, by today’s standards
he was dreadfully timid. He spoke with
a stutter and considered himself inartic-
ulate. The book of Numbers describes
him as “very meek, above all the men
which were upon the face of the earth.”
When God first appeared to him in
the form of a burning bush, Moses was
employed as a shepherd by his father-
in-law;
he
wasn’t
even
ambitious
enough to own his own sheep. And
when God revealed to Moses his role as
liberator of the Jews, did Moses leap at
the opportunity? Send someone else to
186/929
do it, he said. “Who am I, that I should
go to Pharaoh?” he pleaded. “I have
never been eloquent. I am slow of
speech and tongue.”
It was only when God paired him up
with his extroverted brother Aaron that
Moses agreed to take on the assign-
ment.
Moses
would
be
the
speech-
writer, the behind-the-scenes guy, the
Cyrano de Bergerac; Aaron would be
the public face of the operation. “It will
be as if he were your mouth,” said God,
“and as if you were God to him.”
Complemented by Aaron, Moses led
the Jews from Egypt, provided for them
in the desert for the next forty years,
and brought the Ten Commandments
down from Mount Sinai. And he did all
this using strengths that are classically
associated with introversion: climbing a
mountain in search of wisdom and
187/929
writing down carefully, on two stone
tablets, everything he learned there.
We tend to write Moses’ true person-
ality out of the Exodus story. (Cecil B.
DeMille’s classic, The Ten Command-
ments, portrays him as a swashbuckling
figure who does all the talking, with no
help from Aaron.) We don’t ask why
God chose as his prophet a stutterer
with a public speaking phobia. But we
should. The book of Exodus is short on
explication, but its stories suggest that
introversion plays yin to the yang of ex-
troversion; that the medium is not al-
ways the message; and that people fol-
lowed Moses because his words were
thoughtful, not because he spoke them
well.
188/929
If Parks spoke through her actions, and
if Moses spoke through his brother
Aaron, today another type of introver-
ted leader speaks using the Internet.
In his book The Tipping Point, Mal-
colm Gladwell explores the influence of
“Connectors”—people who have a “spe-
cial gift for bringing the world togeth-
er” and “an instinctive and natural gift
for making social connections.” He de-
scribes a “classic Connector” named Ro-
ger Horchow, a charming and success-
ful businessman and backer of Broad-
way hits such as Les Misérables, who
“collects people the same way others
collect stamps.” “If you sat next to Ro-
ger Horchow on a plane ride across the
Atlantic,” writes Gladwell, “he would
start talking as the plane taxied to the
runway, you would be laughing by the
time the seatbelt sign was turned off,
189/929
and when you landed at the other end
you’d wonder where the time went.”
We generally think of Connectors in
just the way that Gladwell describes
Horchow: chatty, outgoing, spellbind-
ing even. But consider for a moment a
modest,
cerebral
man
named
Craig
Newmark. Short, balding, and bespec-
tacled, Newmark was a systems engin-
eer for seventeen years at IBM. Before
that, he had consuming interests in di-
nosaurs, chess, and physics. If you sat
next to him on a plane, he’d probably
keep his nose buried in a book.
Yet Newmark also happens to be the
founder
and
majority
owner
of
Craigslist,
the
eponymous
website
that—well—connects people with each
other. As of May 28, 2011, Craigslist
was the seventh-largest English lan-
guage website in the world. Its users in
over 700 cities in seventy countries find
190/929
jobs, dates, and even kidney donors on
Newmark’s
site.
They
join
singing
groups. They read one another’s haikus.
They confess their affairs. Newmark de-
scribes the site not as a business but as
a public commons.
“Connecting people to fix the world
over time is the deepest spiritual value
you can have,” Newmark has said.
After
Hurricane
Katrina,
Craigslist
helped
stranded
families
find
new
homes. During the New York City trans-
it strike of 2005, Craigslist was the go-
to place for ride-share listings. “Yet an-
other crisis, and Craigslist commands
the community,” wrote one blogger
about Craigslist’s role in the strike.
“How come Craig organically can touch
lives on so many personal levels—and
Craig’s users can touch each other’s
lives on so many levels?”
191/929
Here’s one answer: social media has
made new forms of leadership possible
for scores of people who don’t fit the
Harvard Business School mold.
On August 10, 2008, Guy Kawasaki,
the best-selling author, speaker, serial
entrepreneur,
and
Silicon
Valley
le-
gend, tweeted, “You may find this hard
to believe, but I am an introvert. I have
a ‘role’ to play, but I fundamentally am
a loner.” Kawasaki’s tweet set the world
of social media buzzing. “At the time,”
wrote one blogger, “Guy’s avatar fea-
tured him wearing a pink boa from a
large party he threw at his house. Guy
Kawasaki
an
introvert?
Does
not
compute.”
On August 15, 2008, Pete Cashmore,
the founder of Mashable, the online
guide
to
social
media,
weighed
in.
“Wouldn’t it be a great irony,” he
asked, “if the leading proponents of the
192/929
‘it’s about people’ mantra weren’t so
enamored with meeting large groups of
people in real life? Perhaps social me-
dia affords us the control we lack in
real life socializing: the screen as a bar-
rier between us and the world.” Then
Cashmore outed himself. “Throw me
firmly in the ‘introverts’ camp with
Guy,” he posted.
Studies have shown that, indeed, in-
troverts are more likely than extroverts
to express intimate facts about them-
selves
online
that
their
family
and
friends would be surprised to read, to
say that they can express the “real me”
online, and to spend more time in cer-
tain kinds of online discussions. They
welcome the chance to communicate
digitally. The same person who would
never raise his hand in a lecture hall of
two hundred people might blog to two
thousand,
or
two
million,
without
193/929
thinking twice. The same person who
finds it difficult to introduce himself to
strangers might establish a presence on-
line and then extend these relationships
into the real world.
What
would
have
happened
if
the
Subarctic Survival Situation had been
conducted online, with the benefit of
all the voices in the room—the Rosa
Parkses and the Craig Newmarks and
the Darwin Smiths? What if it had been
a group of proactive castaways led by
an introvert with a gift for calmly en-
couraging them to contribute? What if
there had been an introvert and an ex-
trovert sharing the helm, like Rosa
Parks
and
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.?
194/929
Might
they
have
reached
the
right
result?
It’s impossible to say. No one has
ever run these studies, as far as I
know—which is a shame. It’s under-
standable that the HBS model of leader-
ship places such a high premium on
confidence and quick decision-making.
If assertive people tend to get their
way, then it’s a useful skill for leaders
whose work depends on influencing
others.
Decisiveness
inspires
confid-
ence, while wavering (or even appear-
ing to waver) can threaten morale.
But one can take these truths too far;
in some circumstances quiet, modest
styles of leadership may be equally or
more effective. As I left the HBS cam-
pus, I stopped by a display of notable
Wall
Street
Journal
cartoons
in
the
Baker Library lobby. One showed a
195/929
haggard executive looking at a chart of
steeply falling profits.
“It’s all because of Fradkin,” the ex-
ecutive tells his colleague. “He has ter-
rible business sense but great leader-
ship skills, and everyone is following
him down the road to ruin.”
Does God Love Introverts? An
Evangelical’s Dilemma
If Harvard Business School is an East
Coast enclave for the global elite, my
next stop was an institution that’s much
the opposite. It sits on a sprawling,
120-acre campus in the former desert
and current exurb of Lake Forest, Cali-
fornia. Unlike Harvard Business School,
it admits anyone who wants to join.
Families
stroll
the
palm-tree-lined
plazas and walkways in good-natured
196/929
clumps. Children frolic in man-made
streams and waterfalls. Staff wave ami-
ably as they cruise by in golf carts.
Wear whatever you want: sneakers and
flip-flops are perfectly fine. This cam-
pus is presided over not by nattily at-
tired professors wielding words like
protagonist and case method, but by a
benign Santa Claus–like figure in a
Hawaiian
shirt
and
sandy-haired
goatee.
With an average weekly attendance
of 22,000 and counting, Saddleback
Church is one of the largest and most
influential evangelical churches in the
nation. Its leader is Rick Warren, au-
thor of The Purpose Driven Life, one of
the best-selling books of all time, and
the man who delivered the invocation
at
President
Obama’s
inauguration.
Saddleback doesn’t cater to world-fam-
ous leaders the way HBS does, but it
197/929
plays no less mighty a role in society.
Evangelical leaders have the ear of
presidents;
dominate
thousands
of
hours of TV time; and run multimillion-
dollar businesses, with the most prom-
inent boasting their own production
companies, recording studios, and dis-
tribution deals with media giants like
Time Warner.
Saddleback also has one more thing
in
common
with
Harvard
Business
School: its debt to—and propagation
of—the Culture of Personality.
It’s
a
Sunday
morning
in
August
2006, and I’m standing at the center of
a dense hub of sidewalks on Saddle-
back’s campus. I consult a signpost, the
kind you see at Walt Disney World,
with cheerful arrows pointing every
which
way:
Worship
Center,
Plaza
Room, Terrace Café, Beach Café. A
nearby poster features a beaming young
198/929
man in bright red polo shirt and sneak-
ers: “Looking for a new direction? Give
traffic ministry a try!”
I’m searching for the open-air book-
store,
where
I’ll
be
meeting
Adam
McHugh,
a
local
evangelical
pastor
with whom I’ve been corresponding.
McHugh is an avowed introvert, and
we’ve been having a cross-country con-
versation about what it feels like to be
a quiet and cerebral type in the evan-
gelical movement—especially as a lead-
er. Like HBS, evangelical churches of-
ten make extroversion a prerequisite for
leadership, sometimes explicitly. “The
priest must be … an extrovert who en-
thusiastically
engages
members
and
newcomers, a team player,” reads an ad
for a position as associate rector of a
1,400-member parish. A senior priest at
another church confesses online that he
has advised parishes recruiting a new
199/929
rector to ask what his or her Myers-
Briggs score is. “If the first letter isn’t
an ‘E’ [for extrovert],” he tells them,
“think twice … I’m sure our Lord was
[an extrovert].”
McHugh doesn’t fit this description.
He discovered his introversion as a ju-
nior at Claremont McKenna College,
when he realized he was getting up
early in the morning just to savor time
alone with a steaming cup of coffee. He
enjoyed parties, but found himself leav-
ing early. “Other people would get
louder and louder, and I would get
quieter and quieter,” he told me. He
took a Myers-Briggs personality test
and found out that there was a word,
introvert, that described the type of per-
son who likes to spend time as he did.
At
first
McHugh
felt
good
about
carving out more time for himself. But
then he got active in evangelicalism
200/929
and began to feel guilty about all that
solitude. He even believed that God dis-
approved of his choices and, by exten-
sion, of him.
“The evangelical culture ties together
faithfulness
with
extroversion,”
McHugh explained. “The emphasis is
on
community,
on
participating
in
more and more programs and events,
on meeting more and more people. It’s
a constant tension for many introverts
that they’re not living that out. And in
a religious world, there’s more at stake
when you feel that tension. It doesn’t
feel like ‘I’m not doing as well as I’d
like.’ It feels like ‘God isn’t pleased with
me.’ ”
From outside the evangelical com-
munity, this seems an astonishing con-
fession. Since when is solitude one of
the Seven Deadly Sins? But to a fellow
evangelical, McHugh’s sense of spiritual
201/929
failure would make perfect sense. Con-
temporary
evangelicalism
says
that
every person you fail to meet and pros-
elytize is another soul you might have
saved. It also emphasizes building com-
munity
among
confirmed
believers,
with many churches encouraging (or
even requiring) their members to join
extracurricular
groups
organized
around
every
conceivable
sub-
ject—cooking,
real-estate
investing,
skateboarding. So every social event
McHugh left early, every morning he
spent alone, every group he failed to
join, meant wasted chances to connect
with others.
But, ironically, if there was one thing
McHugh knew, it was that he wasn’t
alone. He looked around and saw a vast
number of people in the evangelical
community who felt just as conflicted
as he did. He became ordained as a
202/929
Presbyterian minister and worked with
a team of student leaders at Claremont
College, many of whom were intro-
verts. The team became a kind of labor-
atory for experimenting with introver-
ted forms of leadership and ministry.
They focused on one-on-one and small
group interactions rather than on large
groups, and McHugh helped the stu-
dents find rhythms in their lives that al-
lowed them to claim the solitude they
needed and enjoyed, and to have social
energy left over for leading others. He
urged them to find the courage to speak
up
and
take
risks
in
meeting
new
people.
A few years later, when social media
exploded and evangelical bloggers star-
ted posting about their experiences,
written evidence of the schism between
introverts and extroverts within the
evangelical
church
finally
emerged.
203/929
One blogger wrote about his “cry from
the heart wondering how to fit in as an
introvert in a church that prides itself
on extroverted evangelism. There are
probably quite a few [of you] out there
who are put on guilt trips each time
[you] get a personal evangelism push at
church. There’s a place in God’s king-
dom for sensitive, reflective types. It’s
not
easy
to
claim,
but
it’s
there.”
Another wrote about his simple desire
“to serve the Lord but not serve on a
parish
committee.
In
a
universal
church, there should be room for the
un-gregarious.”
McHugh added his own voice to this
chorus, first with a blog calling for
greater emphasis on religious practices
of
solitude
and
contemplation,
and
later with a book called Introverts in the
Church: Finding Our Place in an Extrover-
ted Culture. He argues that evangelism
204/929
means listening as well as talking, that
evangelical churches should incorpor-
ate silence and mystery into religious
worship, and that they should make
room for introverted leaders who might
be able to demonstrate a quieter path
to God. After all, hasn’t prayer always
been about contemplation as well as
community? Religious leaders from Je-
sus to Buddha, as well as the lesser-
known saints, monks, shamans, and
prophets, have always gone off alone to
experience the revelations they later
shared with the rest of us.
When finally I find my way to the
bookstore, McHugh is waiting with a
serene expression on his face. He’s in
his
early
thirties,
tall
and
broad-
205/929
shouldered, dressed in jeans, a black
polo shirt, and black flip-flops. With his
short brown hair, reddish goatee, and
sideburns, McHugh looks like a typical
Gen Xer, but he speaks in the soothing,
considered tones of a college professor.
McHugh doesn’t preach or worship at
Saddleback, but we’ve chosen to meet
here because it’s such an important
symbol of evangelical culture.
Since services are just about to start,
there’s little time to chat. Saddleback
offers six different “worship venues,”
each housed in its own building or tent
and
set
to
its
own
beat:
Worship
Center, Traditional, OverDrive Rock,
Gospel, Family, and something called
Ohana Island Style Worship. We head
to the main Worship Center, where
Pastor Warren is about to preach. With
its sky-high ceiling crisscrossed with
klieg lights, the auditorium looks like a
206/929
rock concert venue, save for the unob-
trusive wooden cross hanging on the
side of the room.
A man named Skip is warming up the
congregation with a song. The lyrics
are
broadcast
on
five
Jumbotron
screens, interspersed with photos of
shimmering
lakes
and
Caribbean
sunsets. Miked-up tech guys sit on a
thronelike dais at the center of the
room, training their video cameras on
the audience. The cameras linger on a
teenage girl—long, silky blond hair,
electric
smile,
and
shining
blue
eyes—who’s singing her heart out. I
can’t help but think of Tony Robbins’s
“Unleash the Power Within” seminar.
Did Tony base his program on megach-
urches like Saddleback, I wonder, or is
it the other way around?
“Good morning, everybody!” beams
Skip,
then
urges
us
to
greet
those
207/929
seated near us. Most people oblige with
wide smiles and glad hands, including
McHugh, but there’s a hint of strain be-
neath his smile.
Pastor Warren takes the stage. He’s
wearing a short-sleeved polo shirt and
his famous goatee. Today’s sermon will
be based on the book of Jeremiah, he
tells us. “It would be foolish to start a
business without a business plan,” War-
ren says, “but most people have no life
plan. If you’re a business leader, you
need to read the book of Jeremiah over
and over, because he was a genius
CEO.” There are no Bibles at our seats,
only pencils and note cards, with the
key points from the sermon preprinted,
and blanks to fill in as Warren goes
along.
Like Tony Robbins, Pastor Warren
seems truly well-meaning; he’s created
this vast Saddleback ecosystem out of
208/929
nothing, and he’s done good works
around the world. But at the same time
I can see how hard it must be, inside
this world of Luau worship and Jum-
botron prayer, for Saddleback’s intro-
verts to feel good about themselves. As
the service wears on, I feel the same
sense of alienation that McHugh has de-
scribed. Events like this don’t give me
the sense of oneness others seem to en-
joy; it’s always been private occasions
that make me feel connected to the joys
and sorrows of the world, often in the
form of communion with writers and
musicians I’ll never meet in person.
Proust called these moments of unity
between writer and reader “that fruitful
miracle of a communication in the
midst of solitude.” His use of religious
language was surely no accident.
McHugh, as if reading my mind,
turns to me when the service is over.
209/929
“Everything
in
the
service
involved
communication,” he says with gentle
exasperation.
“Greeting
people,
the
lengthy sermon, the singing. There was
no emphasis on quiet, liturgy, ritual,
things
that
give
you
space
for
contemplation.”
McHugh’s discomfort is all the more
poignant because he genuinely admires
Saddleback and all that it stands for.
“Saddleback is doing amazing things
around the world and in its own com-
munity,” he says. “It’s a friendly, hos-
pitable place that genuinely seeks to
connect with newcomers. That’s an im-
pressive mission given how colossal the
church is, and how easy it would be for
people to remain completely disconnec-
ted from others. Greeters, the informal
atmosphere,
meeting
people
around
you—these are all motivated by good
desires.”
210/929
Yet McHugh finds practices like the
mandatory smile-and-good-morning at
the start of the service to be pain-
ful—and though he personally is will-
ing to endure it, even sees the value in
it, he worries about how many other in-
troverts will not.
“It sets up an extroverted atmosphere
that can be difficult for introverts like
me,” he explains. “Sometimes I feel like
I’m going through the motions. The
outward enthusiasm and passion that
seems to be part and parcel of Saddle-
back’s culture doesn’t feel natural. Not
that introverts can’t be eager and en-
thusiastic, but we’re not as overtly ex-
pressive as extroverts. At a place like
Saddleback, you can start questioning
your own experience of God. Is it really
as strong as that of other people who
look the part of the devout believer?”
211/929
Evangelicalism has taken the Extro-
vert
Ideal
to
its
logical
extreme,
McHugh is telling us. If you don’t love
Jesus out loud, then it must not be real
love. It’s not enough to forge your own
spiritual connection to the divine; it
must be displayed publicly. Is it any won-
der that introverts like Pastor McHugh
start to question their own hearts?
It’s brave of McHugh, whose spiritual
and professional calling depends on his
connection to God, to confess his self-
doubt. He does so because he wants to
spare others the inner conflict he has
struggled with, and because he loves
evangelicalism and wants it to grow by
learning
from
the
introverts
in
its
midst.
But he knows that meaningful change
will come slowly to a religious culture
that sees extroversion not only as a per-
sonality trait but also as an indicator of
212/929
virtue. Righteous behavior is not so
much the good we do behind closed
doors when no one is there to praise us;
it is what we “put out into the world.”
Just as Tony Robbins’s aggressive up-
selling is OK with his fans because
spreading helpful ideas is part of being
a good person, and just as HBS expects
its students to be talkers because this is
seen as a prerequisite of leadership, so
have many evangelicals come to associ-
ate godliness with sociability.

WHEN COLLABORATION KILLS
CREATIVITY
The Rise of the New Groupthink and the
Power of Working Alone
I am a horse for a single harness, not cut
out for tandem or teamwork … for well I
know that in order to attain any definite
goal, it is imperative that one person do
the thinking and the commanding.
—ALBERT EINSTEIN
March 5, 1975. A cold and drizzly
evening
in
Menlo
Park,
California.
Thirty unprepossessing-looking engin-
eers gather in the garage of an unem-
ployed
colleague
named
Gordon
French.
They
call
themselves
the
Homebrew Computer Club, and this is
their first meeting. Their mission: to
make computers accessible to regular
people—no small task at a time when
most
computers
are
temperamental
SUV-sized machines that only universit-
ies and corporations can afford.
The garage is drafty, but the engin-
eers leave the doors open to the damp
night air so people can wander inside.
In walks an uncertain young man of
twenty-four, a calculator designer for
Hewlett-Packard. Serious and bespec-
tacled, he has shoulder-length hair and
a brown beard. He takes a chair and
listens quietly as the others marvel over
a new build-it-yourself computer called
the Altair 8800, which recently made
the cover of Popular Electronics. The
Altair isn’t a true personal computer;
it’s hard to use, and appeals only to the
215/929
type of person who shows up at a gar-
age on a rainy Wednesday night to talk
about microchips. But it’s an important
first step.
The
young
man,
whose
name
is
Stephen Wozniak, is thrilled to hear of
the Altair. He’s been obsessed with
electronics since the age of three. When
he
was
eleven
he
came
across
a
magazine article about the first com-
puter, the ENIAC, or Electronic Numer-
ical Integrator and Computer, and ever
since, his dream has been to build a
machine so small and easy to use that
you could keep it at home. And now,
inside this garage, here is news that
The Dream—he thinks of it with capital
letters—might one day materialize.
As he’ll later recall in his memoir,
iWoz, where most of this story appears,
Wozniak is also excited to be surroun-
ded
by
kindred
spirits.
To
the
216/929
Homebrew crowd, computers are a tool
for social justice, and he feels the same
way. Not that he talks to anyone at this
first meeting—he’s way too shy for
that. But that night he goes home and
sketches his first design for a personal
computer,
with
a
keyboard
and
a
screen just like the kind we use today.
Three months later he builds a proto-
type of that machine. And ten months
after that, he and Steve Jobs cofound
Apple Computer.
Today Steve Wozniak is a revered fig-
ure in Silicon Valley—there’s a street in
San
Jose,
California,
named
Woz’s
Way—and is sometimes called the nerd
soul of Apple. He has learned over time
to open up and speak publicly, even ap-
pearing as a contestant on Dancing with
the Stars, where he displayed an en-
dearing mixture of stiffness and good
cheer. I once saw Wozniak speak at a
217/929
bookstore
in
New
York
City.
A
standing-room-only crowd showed up
bearing their 1970s Apple operating
manuals, in honor of all that he had
done for them.
But the credit is not Wozniak’s alone; it
also belongs to Homebrew. Wozniak
identifies that first meeting as the be-
ginning of the computer revolution and
one of the most important nights of his
life. So if you wanted to replicate the
conditions that made Woz so product-
ive, you might point to Homebrew,
with its collection of like-minded souls.
You
might
decide
that
Wozniak’s
achievement was a shining example of
the collaborative approach to creativ-
ity. You might conclude that people
218/929
who hope to be innovative should work
in highly social workplaces.
And you might be wrong.
Consider
what
Wozniak
did
right
after the meeting in Menlo Park. Did he
huddle with fellow club members to
work on computer design? No. (Al-
though he did keep attending the meet-
ings, every other Wednesday.) Did he
seek out a big, open office space full of
cheerful pandemonium in which ideas
would cross-pollinate? No. When you
read his account of his work process on
that first PC, the most striking thing is
that he was always by himself.
Wozniak did most of the work inside
his cubicle at Hewlett-Packard. He’d ar-
rive around 6:30 a.m. and, alone in the
early
morning,
read
engineering
magazines, study chip manuals, and
prepare designs in his head. After work,
he’d go home, make a quick spaghetti
219/929
or TV dinner, then drive back to the of-
fice and work late into the night. He
describes this period of quiet midnights
and solitary sunrises as “the biggest
high ever.” His efforts paid off on the
night of June 29, 1975, at around
10:00 p.m., when Woz finished build-
ing a prototype of his machine. He hit a
few keys on the keyboard—and letters
appeared on the screen in front of him.
It was the sort of breakthrough moment
that most of us can only dream of. And
he was alone when it happened.
Intentionally so. In his memoir, he
offers this advice to kids who aspire to
great creativity:
Most inventors and engineers I’ve
met are like me—they’re shy and
they live in their heads. They’re al-
most like artists. In fact, the very
best of them are artists. And artists
220/929
work best alone where they can con-
trol an invention’s design without a
lot of other people designing it for
marketing or some other committee.
I don’t believe anything really re-
volutionary has been invented by
committee. If you’re that rare engin-
eer who’s an inventor and also an
artist, I’m going to give you some
advice that might be hard to take.
That advice is: Work alone. You’re
going to be best able to design revolu-
tionary products and features if you’re
working on your own. Not on a com-
mittee. Not on a team.
From 1956 to 1962, an era best re-
membered for its ethos of stultifying
conformity, the Institute of Personality
221/929
Assessment
and
Research
at
the
University of California, Berkeley, con-
ducted a series of studies on the nature
of creativity. The researchers sought to
identify the most spectacularly creative
people and then figure out what made
them different from everybody else.
They assembled a list of architects,
mathematicians,
scientists,
engineers,
and writers who had made major con-
tributions to their fields, and invited
them to Berkeley for a weekend of per-
sonality tests, problem-solving experi-
ments, and probing questions.
Then the researchers did something
similar with members of the same pro-
fessions whose contributions were de-
cidedly less groundbreaking.
One of the most interesting findings,
echoed by later studies, was that the
more creative people tended to be so-
cially
poised
introverts.
They
were
222/929
interpersonally skilled but “not of an
especially sociable or participative tem-
perament.” They described themselves
as independent and individualistic. As
teens, many had been shy and solitary.
These findings don’t mean that intro-
verts are always more creative than ex-
troverts, but they do suggest that in a
group of people who have been ex-
tremely creative throughout their life-
times, you’re likely to find a lot of in-
troverts. Why should this be true? Do
quiet personalities come with some in-
effable quality that fuels creativity?
Perhaps, as we’ll see in chapter 6.
But there’s a less obvious yet surpris-
ingly powerful explanation for intro-
verts’ creative advantage—an explana-
tion that everyone can learn from: intro-
verts prefer to work independently, and
solitude can be a catalyst to innovation.
As the influential psychologist Hans
223/929
Eysenck
once
observed,
introversion
“concentrates the mind on the tasks in
hand, and prevents the dissipation of
energy on social and sexual matters un-
related to work.” In other words, if
you’re in the backyard sitting under a
tree while everyone else is clinking
glasses on the patio, you’re more likely
to have an apple fall on your head.
(Newton was one of the world’s great
introverts.
William
Wordsworth
de-
scribed him as “A mind forever / Voy-
aging through strange seas of Thought
alone.”)
If this is true—if solitude is an import-
ant key to creativity—then we might all
want to develop a taste for it. We’d
want
to
teach
our
kids
to
work
224/929
independently. We’d want to give em-
ployees
plenty
of
privacy
and
autonomy. Yet increasingly we do just
the opposite.
We like to believe that we live in a
grand age of creative individualism. We
look back at the midcentury era in
which the Berkeley researchers conduc-
ted their creativity studies, and feel su-
perior. Unlike the starched-shirted con-
formists of the 1950s, we hang posters
of Einstein on our walls, his tongue
stuck out iconoclastically. We consume
indie music and films, and generate our
own online content. We “think differ-
ent” (even if we got the idea from
Apple
Computer’s
famous
ad
campaign).
But the way we organize many of our
most
important
institutions—our
schools and our workplaces—tells a
very different story. It’s the story of a
225/929
contemporary phenomenon that I call
the New Groupthink—a phenomenon
that has the potential to stifle pro-
ductivity
at
work
and
to
deprive
schoolchildren of the skills they’ll need
to achieve excellence in an increasingly
competitive world.
The New Groupthink elevates team-
work above all else. It insists that cre-
ativity
and
intellectual
achievement
come from a gregarious place. It has
many
powerful
advocates.
“Innovation—the heart of the know-
ledge economy—is fundamentally so-
cial,” writes the prominent journalist
Malcolm Gladwell. “None of us is as
smart as all of us,” declares the organiz-
ational consultant Warren Bennis, in his
book Organizing Genius, whose opening
chapter heralds the rise of the “Great
Group” and “The End of the Great
Man.” “Many jobs that we regard as the
226/929
province of a single mind actually re-
quire a crowd,” muses Clay Shirky in
his influential book Here Comes Every-
body. Even “Michelangelo had assist-
ants paint part of the Sistine Chapel
ceiling.” (Never mind that the assistants
were
likely
interchangeable,
while
Michelangelo was not.)
The New Groupthink is embraced by
many corporations, which increasingly
organize workforces into teams, a prac-
tice that gained popularity in the early
1990s. By 2000 an estimated half of all
U.S.
organizations
used
teams,
and
today virtually all of them do, accord-
ing to the management professor Fred-
erick Morgeson. A recent survey found
that 91 percent of high-level managers
believe that teams are the key to suc-
cess. The consultant Stephen Harvill
told me that of the thirty major organ-
izations
he
worked
with
in
2010,
227/929
including J.C. Penney, Wells Fargo, Dell
Computers, and Prudential, he couldn’t
think of a single one that didn’t use
teams.
Some
of
these
teams
are
virtual,
working together from remote loca-
tions, but others demand a tremendous
amount of face-to-face interaction, in
the form of team-building exercises and
retreats, shared online calendars that
announce employees’ availability for
meetings, and physical workplaces that
afford little privacy. Today’s employees
inhabit open office plans, in which no
one has a room of his or her own, the
only walls are the ones holding up the
building, and senior executives operate
from the center of the boundary-less
floor along with everyone else. In fact,
over 70 percent of today’s employees
work in an open plan; companies using
them include Procter & Gamble, Ernst
228/929
& Young, GlaxoSmithKline, Alcoa, and
H.J. Heinz.
The amount of space per employee
shrank from 500 square feet in the
1970s to 200 square feet in 2010, ac-
cording to Peter Miscovich, a managing
director at the real estate brokerage
firm Jones Lang LaSalle. “There has
been a shift from ‘I’ to ‘we’ work,”
Steelcase CEO James Hackett told Fast
Company magazine in 2005. “Employ-
ees used to work alone in ‘I’ settings.
Today, working in teams and groups is
highly
valued.
We
are
designing
products to facilitate that.” Rival office
manufacturer Herman Miller, Inc., has
not only introduced new furniture de-
signed to accommodate “the move to-
ward collaboration and teaming in the
workplace” but also moved its own top
executives from private offices to an
open space. In 2006, the Ross School of
229/929
Business at the University of Michigan
demolished
a
classroom
building
in
part because it wasn’t set up for maxim-
um group interaction.
The New Groupthink is also practiced
in our schools, via an increasingly pop-
ular method of instruction called “co-
operative” or “small group” learning. In
many elementary schools, the tradition-
al rows of seats facing the teacher have
been replaced with “pods” of four or
more desks pushed together to facilitate
countless
group
learning
activities.
Even subjects like math and creative
writing, which would seem to depend
on solo flights of thought, are often
taught as group projects. In one fourth-
grade classroom I visited, a big sign an-
nounced the “Rules for Group Work,”
including, YOU CAN’T ASK A TEACHER FOR
HELP UNLESS EVERYONE IN YOUR GROUP HAS
THE SAME QUESTION.
230/929
According to a 2002 nationwide sur-
vey of more than 1,200 fourth- and
eighth-grade teachers, 55 percent of
fourth-grade teachers prefer cooperat-
ive learning, compared to only 26 per-
cent
who
favor
teacher-directed
formats. Only 35 percent of fourth-
grade and 29 percent of eighth-grade
teachers spend more than half their
classroom time on traditional instruc-
tion, while 42 percent of fourth-grade
and 41 percent of eighth-grade teachers
spend at least a quarter of class time on
group work. Among younger teachers,
small-group learning is even more pop-
ular, suggesting that the trend will con-
tinue for some time to come.
The cooperative approach has politic-
ally progressive roots—the theory is
that students take ownership of their
education when they learn from one
another—but according to elementary
231/929
school teachers I interviewed at public
and
private
schools
in
New
York,
Michigan, and Georgia, it also trains
kids to express themselves in the team
culture
of
corporate
America.
“This
style of teaching reflects the business
community,” one fifth-grade teacher in
a Manhattan public school told me,
“where people’s respect for others is
based on their verbal abilities, not their
originality or insight. You have to be
someone who speaks well and calls at-
tention to yourself. It’s an elitism based
on
something
other
than
merit.”
“Today the world of business works in
groups,
so
now
the
kids
do
it
in
school,” a third-grade teacher in Dec-
atur, Georgia, explained. “Cooperative
learning enables skills in working as
teams—skills that are in dire demand in
the workplace,” writes the educational
consultant Bruce Williams.
232/929
Williams
also
identifies
leadership
training as a primary benefit of cooper-
ative learning. Indeed, the teachers I
met seemed to pay close attention to
their students’ managerial skills. In one
public school I visited in downtown At-
lanta, a third-grade teacher pointed out
a quiet student who likes to “do his
own thing.” “But we put him in charge
of safety patrol one morning, so he got
the chance to be a leader, too,” she as-
sured me.
This teacher was kind and well-inten-
tioned, but I wonder whether students
like the young safety officer would be
better off if we appreciated that not
everyone aspires to be a leader in the
conventional sense of the word—that
some people wish to fit harmoniously
into the group, and others to be inde-
pendent of it. Often the most highly
creative
people
are
in
the
latter
233/929
category. As Janet Farrall and Leonie
Kronborg write in Leadership Develop-
ment for the Gifted and Talented:
While extroverts tend to attain lead-
ership in public domains, introverts
tend to attain leadership in theoret-
ical and aesthetic fields. Outstand-
ing
introverted
leaders,
such
as
Charles Darwin, Marie Curie, Patrick
White and Arthur Boyd, who have
created either new fields of thought
or rearranged existing knowledge,
have spent long periods of their
lives in solitude. Hence leadership
does not only apply in social situ-
ations, but also occurs in more solit-
ary situations such as developing
new techniques in the arts, creating
new philosophies, writing profound
books
and
making
scientific
breakthroughs.
234/929
The New Groupthink did not arise at
one precise moment. Cooperative learn-
ing, corporate teamwork, and open of-
fice plans emerged at different times
and
for
different
reasons.
But
the
mighty force that pulled these trends
together was the rise of the World Wide
Web, which lent both cool and gravitas
to the idea of collaboration. On the In-
ternet, wondrous creations were pro-
duced via shared brainpower: Linux,
the
open-source
operating
system;
Wikipedia,
the
online
encyclopedia;
MoveOn.org,
the
grassroots
political
movement.
These
collective
produc-
tions, exponentially greater than the
sum of their parts, were so awe-inspir-
ing that we came to revere the hive
mind, the wisdom of crowds, the mir-
acle of crowdsourcing. Collaboration be-
came a sacred concept—the key multi-
plier for success.
235/929
But then we took things a step fur-
ther than the facts called for. We came
to value transparency and to knock
down walls—not only online but also in
person. We failed to realize that what
makes sense for the asynchronous, rel-
atively anonymous interactions of the
Internet might not work as well inside
the
face-to-face,
politically
charged,
acoustically noisy confines of an open-
plan office. Instead of distinguishing
between online and in-person interac-
tion, we used the lessons of one to in-
form our thinking about the other.
That’s why, when people talk about
aspects of the New Groupthink such as
open office plans, they tend to invoke
the Internet. “Employees are putting
their whole lives up on Facebook and
Twitter and everywhere else anyway.
There’s no reason they should hide be-
hind a cubicle wall,” Dan Lafontaine,
236/929
CFO of the social marketing firm Mr.
Youth, told NPR. Another management
consultant told me something similar:
“An
office
wall
is
exactly
what
it
sounds like—a barrier. The fresher your
methodologies of thinking, the less you
want boundaries. The companies who
use open office plans are new compan-
ies, just like the World Wide Web,
which is still a teenager.”
The Internet’s role in promoting face-
to-face group work is especially ironic
because the early Web was a medium
that enabled bands of often introverted
individualists—people
much
like
the
solitude-craving thought leaders Farrall
and Kronborg describe—to come to-
gether to subvert and transcend the
usual ways of problem-solving. A signi-
ficant majority of the earliest computer
enthusiasts were introverts, according
to
a
study
of
1,229
computer
237/929
professionals working in the U.S., the
U.K., and Australia between 1982 and
1984. “It’s a truism in tech that open
source attracts introverts,” says Dave
W. Smith, a consultant and software de-
veloper in Silicon Valley, referring to
the practice of producing software by
opening the source code to the online
public and allowing anyone to copy,
improve upon, and distribute it. Many
of these people were motivated by a de-
sire to contribute to the broader good,
and to see their achievements recog-
nized by a community they valued.
But the earliest open-source creators
didn’t share office space—often they
didn’t even live in the same country.
Their collaborations took place largely
in the ether. This is not an insignificant
detail. If you had gathered the same
people who created Linux, installed
them in a giant conference room for a
238/929
year, and asked them to devise a new
operating system, it’s doubtful that any-
thing so revolutionary would have oc-
curred—for reasons we’ll explore in the
rest of this chapter.
When the research psychologist Anders
Ericsson was fifteen, he took up chess.
He was pretty good at it, he thought,
trouncing
all
his
classmates
during
lunchtime matches. Until one day a boy
who’d been one of the worst players in
the class started to win every match.
Ericsson
wondered
what
had
happened. “I really thought about this a
lot,” he recalls in an interview with
Daniel Coyle, author of The Talent Code.
“Why could that boy, whom I had
beaten so easily, now beat me just as
239/929
easily? I knew he was studying, going
to
a
chess
club,
but
what
had
happened, really, underneath?”
This is the question that drives Eric-
sson’s career: How do extraordinary
achievers get to be so great at what
they do? Ericsson has searched for an-
swers in fields as diverse as chess, ten-
nis, and classical piano.
In a now-famous experiment, he and
his colleagues compared three groups
of expert violinists at the elite Music
Academy in West Berlin. The research-
ers asked the professors to divide the
students into three groups: the “best vi-
olinists,” who had the potential for ca-
reers
as
international
soloists;
the
“good violinists”; and a third group
training to be violin teachers rather
than performers. Then they interviewed
the musicians and asked them to keep
detailed diaries of their time.
240/929
They
found
a
striking
difference
among the groups. All three groups
spent the same amount of time—over
fifty hours a week—participating in
music-related activities. All three had
similar classroom requirements making
demands on their time. But the two
best groups spent most of their music-
related time practicing in solitude: 24.3
hours a week, or 3.5 hours a day, for
the best group, compared with only 9.3
hours a week, or 1.3 hours a day, for
the worst group. The best violinists
rated “practice alone” as the most im-
portant of all their music-related activ-
ities. Elite musicians—even those who
perform in groups—describe practice
sessions with their chamber group as
“leisure” compared with solo practice,
where the real work gets done.
Ericsson and his cohorts found simil-
ar effects of solitude when they studied
241/929
other kinds of expert performers. “Seri-
ous study alone” is the strongest pre-
dictor
of
skill
for
tournament-rated
chess players, for example; grandmas-
ters typically spend a whopping five
thousand hours—almost five times as
many hours as intermediate-level play-
ers—studying the game by themselves
during their first ten years of learning
to play. College students who tend to
study alone learn more over time than
those who work in groups. Even elite
athletes in team sports often spend un-
usual
amounts
of
time
in
solitary
practice.
What’s so magical about solitude? In
many fields, Ericsson told me, it’s only
when you’re alone that you can engage
in Deliberate Practice, which he has
identified as the key to exceptional
achievement. When you practice delib-
erately,
you
identify
the
tasks
or
242/929
knowledge that are just out of your
reach, strive to upgrade your perform-
ance, monitor your progress, and revise
accordingly. Practice sessions that fall
short of this standard are not only less
useful—they’re
counterproductive.
They reinforce existing cognitive mech-
anisms instead of improving them.
Deliberate Practice is best conducted
alone for several reasons. It takes in-
tense concentration, and other people
can be distracting. It requires deep mo-
tivation, often self-generated. But most
important, it involves working on the
task that’s most challenging to you per-
sonally. Only when you’re alone, Eric-
sson told me, can you “go directly to
the part that’s challenging to you. If
you want to improve what you’re do-
ing, you have to be the one who gener-
ates
the
move.
Imagine
a
group
class—you’re the one generating the
243/929
move only a small percentage of the
time.”
To see Deliberate Practice in action,
we need look no further than the story
of Stephen Wozniak. The Homebrew
meeting was the catalyst that inspired
him to build that first PC, but the
knowledge base and work habits that
made it possible came from another
place entirely: Woz had deliberately
practiced engineering ever since he was
a little kid. (Ericsson says that it takes
approximately ten thousand hours of
Deliberate Practice to gain true expert-
ise, so it helps to start young.)
In iWoz, Wozniak describes his child-
hood passion for electronics, and unin-
tentionally recounts all the elements of
Deliberate Practice that Ericsson em-
phasizes. First, he was motivated: his
father, a Lockheed engineer, had taught
Woz
that
engineers
could
change
244/929
people’s lives and were “among the key
people in the world.” Second, he built
his expertise step by painstaking step.
Because he entered countless science
fairs, he says,
I acquired a central ability that was
to help me through my entire ca-
reer: patience. I’m serious. Patience
is usually so underrated. I mean, for
all those projects, from third grade
all the way to eighth grade, I just
learned things gradually, figuring
out how to put electronic devices to-
gether without so much as cracking
a book.… I learned to not worry so
much about the outcome, but to
concentrate on the step I was on and
to try to do it as perfectly as I could
when I was doing it.
245/929
Third, Woz often worked alone. This
was not necessarily by choice. Like
many technically inclined kids, he took
a painful tumble down the social ladder
when he got to junior high school. As a
boy he’d been admired for his science
prowess, but now nobody seemed to
care. He hated small talk, and his in-
terests were out of step with those of
his
peers.
A
black-and-white
photo
from
this
period
shows
Woz,
hair
closely cropped, grimacing intensely,
pointing proudly at his “science-fair-
winning Adder/Subtractor,” a boxlike
contraption of wires, knobs, and giz-
mos. But the awkwardness of those
years didn’t deter him from pursuing
his dream; it probably nurtured it. He
would never have learned so much
about computers, Woz says now, if he
hadn’t been too shy to leave the house.
246/929
No one would choose this sort of
painful adolescence, but the fact is that
the solitude of Woz’s teens, and the
single-minded
focus on what would
turn out to be a lifelong passion, is typ-
ical for highly creative people. Accord-
ing
to
the
psychologist
Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi, who between 1990
and 1995 studied the lives of ninety-
one exceptionally creative people in the
arts, sciences, business, and govern-
ment, many of his subjects were on the
social
margins
during
adolescence,
partly because “intense curiosity or fo-
cused
interest
seems
odd
to
their
peers.” Teens who are too gregarious to
spend time alone often fail to cultivate
their talents “because practicing music
or studying math requires a solitude
they dread.” Madeleine L’Engle, the au-
thor of the classic young adult novel A
Wrinkle in Time and more than sixty
247/929
other books, says that she would never
have
developed
into
such
a
bold
thinker had she not spent so much of
her childhood alone with books and
ideas. As a young boy, Charles Darwin
made friends easily but preferred to
spend his time taking long, solitary
nature walks. (As an adult he was no
different. “My dear Mr. Babbage,” he
wrote to the famous mathematician
who had invited him to a dinner party,
“I am very much obliged to you for
sending me cards for your parties, but I
am afraid of accepting them, for I
should
meet
some
people
there,
to
whom I have sworn by all the saints in
Heaven, I never go out.”)
But exceptional performance depends
not only on the groundwork we lay
through Deliberate Practice; it also re-
quires the right working conditions.
248/929
And in contemporary workplaces, these
are surprisingly hard to come by.
One of the side benefits of being a con-
sultant is getting intimate access to
many
different
work
environments.
Tom DeMarco, a principal of the At-
lantic Systems Guild team of consult-
ants, had walked around a good num-
ber of offices in his time, and he no-
ticed that some workspaces were a lot
more densely packed than others. He
wondered what effect all that social in-
teraction had on performance.
To find out, DeMarco and his col-
league Timothy Lister devised a study
called the Coding War Games. The pur-
pose of the games was to identify the
characteristics of the best and worst
249/929
computer programmers; more than six
hundred
developers
from
ninety-two
different companies participated. Each
designed, coded, and tested a program,
working in his normal office space dur-
ing business hours. Each participant
was also assigned a partner from the
same company. The partners worked
separately, however, without any com-
munication, a feature of the games that
turned out to be critical.
When the results came in, they re-
vealed an enormous performance gap.
The best outperformed the worst by a
10:1 ratio. The top programmers were
also about 2.5 times better than the me-
dian. When DeMarco and Lister tried to
figure out what accounted for this as-
tonishing range, the factors that you’d
think would matter—such as years of
experience, salary, even the time spent
completing
the
work—had
little
250/929
correlation to outcome. Programmers
with ten years’ experience did no better
than those with two years. The half
who
performed
above
the
median
earned less than 10 percent more than
the half below—even though they were
almost twice as good. The programmers
who turned in “zero-defect” work took
slightly less, not more, time to com-
plete the exercise than those who made
mistakes.
It was a mystery with one intriguing
clue: programmers from the same com-
panies performed at more or less the
same
level,
even
though
they
hadn’t
worked together. That’s because top per-
formers
overwhelmingly
worked
for
companies that gave their workers the
most privacy, personal space, control
over their physical environments, and
freedom from interruption. Sixty-two
percent of the best performers said that
251/929
their workspace was acceptably private,
compared to only 19 percent of the
worst performers; 76 percent of the
worst performers but only 38 percent of
the top performers said that people of-
ten interrupted them needlessly.
The Coding War Games are well
known in tech circles, but DeMarco and
Lister’s findings reach beyond the world
of computer programmers. A mountain
of recent data on open-plan offices from
many different industries corroborates
the results of the games. Open-plan of-
fices have been found to reduce pro-
ductivity and impair memory. They’re
associated
with
high
staff
turnover.
They make people sick, hostile, unmo-
tivated, and insecure. Open-plan work-
ers are more likely to suffer from high
blood
pressure
and
elevated
stress
levels and to get the flu; they argue
more with their colleagues; they worry
252/929
about
coworkers
eavesdropping
on
their phone calls and spying on their
computer screens. They have fewer per-
sonal
and
confidential
conversations
with colleagues. They’re often subject
to loud and uncontrollable noise, which
raises heart rates; releases cortisol, the
body’s fight-or-flight “stress” hormone;
and
makes
people
socially
distant,
quick to anger, aggressive, and slow to
help others.
Indeed, excessive stimulation seems
to
impede
learning:
a
recent
study
found that people learn better after a
quiet stroll through the woods than
after a noisy walk down a city street.
Another study, of 38,000 knowledge
workers across different sectors, found
that the simple act of being interrupted
is one of the biggest barriers to pro-
ductivity.
Even
multitasking,
that
prized
feat
of
modern-day
office
253/929
warriors, turns out to be a myth. Scient-
ists now know that the brain is incap-
able of paying attention to two things
at the same time. What looks like mul-
titasking is really switching back and
forth between multiple tasks, which re-
duces productivity and increases mis-
takes by up to 50 percent.
Many introverts seem to know these
things instinctively, and resist being
herded together. Backbone Entertain-
ment, a video game design company in
Oakland, California, initially used an
open office plan but found that their
game developers, many of whom were
introverts, were unhappy. “It was one
big warehouse space, with just tables,
no walls, and everyone could see each
other,” recalls Mike Mika, the former
creative director. “We switched over to
cubicles
and
were
worried
about
it—you’d
think
in
a
creative
254/929
environment that people would hate
that. But it turns out they prefer having
nooks and crannies they can hide away
in and just be away from everybody.”
Something similar happened at Ree-
bok International when, in 2000, the
company consolidated 1,250 employees
in their new headquarters in Canton,
Massachusetts. The managers assumed
that their shoe designers would want
office space with plenty of access to
each other so they could brainstorm (an
idea they probably picked up when
they were getting their MBAs). Luckily,
they consulted first with the shoe de-
signers themselves, who told them that
actually what they needed was peace
and quiet so they could concentrate.
This would not have come as news to
Jason Fried, cofounder of the web ap-
plication company 37signals. For ten
years, beginning in 2000, Fried asked
255/929
hundreds of people (mostly designers,
programmers, and writers) where they
liked to work when they needed to get
something done. He found that they
went anywhere but their offices, which
were too noisy and full of interruptions.
That’s why, of Fried’s sixteen employ-
ees, only eight live in Chicago, where
37signals is based, and even they are
not required to show up for work, even
for meetings. Especially not for meet-
ings, which Fried views as “toxic.”
Fried is not anti-collaboration—37sig-
nals’ home page touts its products’ abil-
ity to make collaboration productive
and pleasant. But he prefers passive
forms of collaboration like e-mail, in-
stant messaging, and online chat tools.
His
advice
for
other
employers?
“Cancel your next meeting,” he advises.
“Don’t
reschedule
it.
Erase
it
from
memory.” He also suggests “No-Talk
256/929
Thursdays,” one day a week in which
employees aren’t allowed to speak to
each other.
The people Fried interviewed were
saying out loud what creative people
have
always
known.
Kafka,
for
ex-
ample, couldn’t bear to be near even
his adoring fiancée while he worked:
You once said that you would like to
sit beside me while I write. Listen,
in that case I could not write at all.
For writing means revealing oneself
to excess; that utmost of self-revela-
tion and surrender, in which a hu-
man being, when involved with oth-
ers, would feel he was losing him-
self, and from which, therefore, he
will always shrink as long as he is in
his right mind.… That is why one
can never be alone enough when
one writes, why there can never be
257/929
enough silence around one when
one writes, why even night is not
night enough.
Even the considerably more cheerful
Theodor Geisel (otherwise known as
Dr.
Seuss)
spent
his
workdays
en-
sconced in his private studio, the walls
lined with sketches and drawings, in a
bell-tower outside his La Jolla, Califor-
nia, house. Geisel was a much more
quiet man than his jocular rhymes sug-
gest. He rarely ventured out in public
to meet his young readership, fretting
that kids would expect a merry, out-
spoken, Cat in the Hat–like figure, and
would be disappointed with his re-
served personality. “In mass, [children]
terrify me,” he admitted.
258/929
If personal space is vital to creativity,
so is freedom from “peer pressure.”
Consider the story of the legendary ad-
vertising man Alex Osborn. Today Os-
born’s name rings few bells, but during
the first half of the twentieth century
he
was
the
kind
of
larger-than-life
renaissance man who mesmerized his
contemporaries. Osborn was a founding
partner of the advertising agency Bat-
ten,
Barton,
Durstine,
and
Osborn
(BBDO), but it was as an author that he
really made his mark, beginning with
the day in 1938 that a magazine editor
invited him to lunch and asked what
his hobby was.
“Imagination,” replied Osborn.
“Mr. Osborn,” said the editor, “you
must do a book on that. It’s a job that
has been waiting to be done all these
years. There is no subject of greater
259/929
importance. You must give it the time
and
energy
and
thoroughness
it
deserves.”
And so Mr. Osborn did. He wrote sev-
eral books during the 1940s and 1950s,
in fact, each tackling a problem that
had vexed him in his capacity as head
of BBDO: his employees were not creat-
ive enough. They had good ideas, Os-
born believed, but were loath to share
them
for
fear
of
their
colleagues’
judgment.
For Osborn, the solution was not to
have his employees work alone, but
rather to remove the threat of criticism
from
group
work.
He
invented
the
concept of brainstorming, a process in
which group members generate ideas in
a
nonjudgmental
atmosphere.
Brain-
storming had four rules:
260/929
1. Don’t judge or criticize ideas.
2. Be freewheeling. The wilder the
idea, the better.
3. Go for quantity. The more ideas
you have, the better.
4. Build on the ideas of fellow group
members.
Osborn
believed
passionately
that
groups—once freed from the shackles
of
social
judgment—produced
more
and better ideas than did individuals
working in solitude, and he made grand
claims for his favored method. “The
quantitative
results
of
group
brain-
storming
are
beyond
question,”
he
wrote. “One group produced 45 sugges-
tions for a home-appliance promotion,
56 ideas for a money-raising campaign,
124 ideas on how to sell more blankets.
In
another
case,
15
groups
261/929
brainstormed one and the same prob-
lem and produced over 800 ideas.”
Osborn’s theory had great impact,
and company leaders took up brain-
storming with enthusiasm. To this day,
it’s common for anyone who spends
time in corporate America to find him-
self occasionally cooped up with col-
leagues in a room full of whiteboards,
markers, and a preternaturally peppy
facilitator
encouraging
everyone
to
free-associate.
There’s only one problem with Os-
born’s breakthrough idea: group brain-
storming doesn’t actually work. One of
the first studies to demonstrate this was
conducted in 1963. Marvin Dunnette, a
psychology professor at the University
of Minnesota, gathered forty-eight re-
search scientists and forty-eight advert-
ising executives, all of them male em-
ployees
of
Minnesota
Mining
and
262/929
Manufacturing
(otherwise
known
as
3M, inventors of the Post-it), and asked
them to participate in both solitary and
group brainstorming sessions. Dunnette
was
confident
that
the
executives
would benefit from the group process.
He was less sure that the research sci-
entists, whom he considered more in-
troverted,
would
profit
from
group
work.
Dunnette divided each set of forty-
eight men into twelve groups of four.
Each foursome was given a problem to
brainstorm, such as the benefits or diffi-
culties that would arise from being
born with an extra thumb. Each man
was also given a similar problem to
brainstorm on his own. Then Dunnette
and his team counted all the ideas,
comparing
those
produced
by
the
groups with those generated by people
working
individually.
In
order
to
263/929
compare apples with apples, Dunnette
pooled the ideas of each individual to-
gether with those of three other indi-
viduals, as if they had been working in
“nominal” groups of four. The research-
ers also measured the quality of the
ideas, rating them on a “Probability
Scale” of 0 through 4.
The results were unambiguous. The
men in twenty-three of the twenty-four
groups produced more ideas when they
worked on their own than when they
worked as a group. They also produced
ideas of equal or higher quality when
working individually. And the advert-
ising executives were no better at group
work than the presumably introverted
research scientists.
Since then, some forty years of re-
search has reached the same startling
conclusion. Studies have shown that
performance gets worse as group size
264/929
increases: groups of nine generate few-
er and poorer ideas compared to groups
of six, which do worse than groups of
four. The “evidence from science sug-
gests that business people must be in-
sane
to
use
brainstorming
groups,”
writes the organizational psychologist
Adrian Furnham. “If you have talented
and motivated people, they should be
encouraged to work alone when cre-
ativity
or
efficiency
is
the
highest
priority.”
The one exception to this is online
brainstorming.
Groups
brainstorming
electronically, when properly managed,
not only do better than individuals, re-
search shows; the larger the group, the
better it performs. The same is true of
academic
research—professors
who
work together electronically, from dif-
ferent physical locations, tend to pro-
duce research that is more influential
265/929
than those either working alone or
collaborating face-to-face.
This shouldn’t surprise us; as we’ve
said, it was the curious power of elec-
tronic collaboration that contributed to
the New Groupthink in the first place.
What created Linux, or Wikipedia, if
not a gigantic electronic brainstorming
session? But we’re so impressed by the
power
of
online
collaboration
that
we’ve come to overvalue all group work
at the expense of solo thought. We fail
to realize that participating in an online
working group is a form of solitude all
its own. Instead we assume that the
success of online collaborations will be
replicated in the face-to-face world.
Indeed, after all these years of evid-
ence that conventional brainstorming
groups don’t work, they remain as pop-
ular as ever. Participants in brainstorm-
ing sessions usually believe that their
266/929
group performed much better than it
actually did, which points to a valuable
reason
for
their
continued
popular-
ity—group brainstorming makes people
feel attached. A worthy goal, so long as
we understand that social glue, as op-
posed to creativity, is the principal
benefit.
Psychologists usually offer three ex-
planations
for
the
failure
of
group
brainstorming. The first is social loafing:
in a group, some individuals tend to sit
back and let others do the work. The
second is production blocking: only one
person can talk or produce an idea at
once, while the other group members
are forced to sit passively. And the
third
is
evaluation
apprehension,
267/929
meaning the fear of looking stupid in
front of one’s peers.
Osborn’s
“rules”
of
brainstorming
were meant to neutralize this anxiety,
but studies show that the fear of public
humiliation is a potent force. During
the 1988–89 basketball season, for ex-
ample,
two
NCAA
basketball
teams
played eleven games without any spec-
tators, owing to a measles outbreak
that led their schools to quarantine all
students. Both teams played much bet-
ter (higher free-throw percentages, for
example)
without
any
fans,
even
adoring home-team fans, to unnerve
them.
The behavioral economist Dan Ariely
noticed a similar phenomenon when he
conducted a study asking thirty-nine
participants to solve anagram puzzles,
either alone at their desks or with oth-
ers watching. Ariely predicted that the
268/929
participants would do better in public
because they’d be more motivated. But
they performed worse. An audience
may be rousing, but it’s also stressful.
The problem with evaluation appre-
hension is that there’s not much we can
do about it. You’d think you could
overcome it with will or training or a
set of group process rules like Alex Os-
born’s. But recent research in neuros-
cience suggests that the fear of judg-
ment runs much deeper and has more
far-reaching implications than we ever
imagined.
Between 1951 and 1956, just as Os-
born was promoting the power of group
brainstorming, a psychologist named
Solomon Asch conducted a series of
now-famous
experiments
on
the
dangers
of
group
influence.
Asch
gathered student volunteers into groups
and had them take a vision test. He
269/929
showed them a picture of three lines of
varying lengths and asked questions
about how the lines compared with one
another: which was longer, which one
matched the length of a fourth line, and
so on. His questions were so simple that
95 percent of students answered every
question correctly.
But when Asch planted actors in the
groups, and the actors confidently vo-
lunteered the same incorrect answer,
the number of students who gave all
correct answers plunged to 25 percent.
That is, a staggering 75 percent of the
participants
went
along
with
the
group’s wrong answer to at least one
question.
The Asch experiments demonstrated
the power of conformity at exactly the
time that Osborn was trying to release
us from its chains. What they didn’t tell
us
was
why
we
were
so
prone
to
270/929
conform. What was going on in the
minds of the kowtowers? Had their per-
ception of the lines’ lengths been altered
by peer pressure, or did they knowingly
give wrong answers for fear of being
the odd one out? For decades, psycho-
logists puzzled over this question.
Today, with the help of brain-scan-
ning technology, we may be getting
closer to the answer. In 2005 an Emory
University
neuroscientist
named
Gregory Berns decided to conduct an
updated version of Asch’s experiments.
Berns and his team recruited thirty-two
volunteers, men and women between
the ages of nineteen and forty-one. The
volunteers played a game in which
each group member was shown two
different three-dimensional objects on a
computer screen and asked to decide
whether the first object could be ro-
tated
to
match
the
second.
The
271/929
experimenters used an fMRI scanner to
take snapshots of the volunteers’ brains
as they conformed to or broke with
group opinion.
The results were both disturbing and
illuminating. First, they corroborated
Asch’s findings. When the volunteers
played the game on their own, they
gave the wrong answer only 13.8 per-
cent of the time. But when they played
with a group whose members gave un-
animously wrong answers, they agreed
with the group 41 percent of the time.
But Berns’s study also shed light on
exactly why we’re such conformists.
When the volunteers played alone, the
brain scans showed activity in a net-
work of brain regions including the oc-
cipital cortex and parietal cortex, which
are associated with visual and spatial
perception, and in the frontal cortex,
which
is
associated
with
conscious
272/929
decision-making. But when they went
along with their group’s wrong answer,
their brain activity revealed something
very different.
Remember,
what
Asch
wanted
to
know was whether people conformed
despite knowing that the group was
wrong, or whether their perceptions
had been altered by the group. If the
former was true, Berns and his team
reasoned, then they should see more
brain activity in the decision-making
prefrontal cortex. That is, the brain
scans would pick up the volunteers de-
ciding consciously
to abandon their
own beliefs to fit in with the group. But
if the brain scans showed heightened
activity in regions associated with visu-
al and spatial perception, this would
suggest that the group had somehow
managed
to
change
the
individual’s
perceptions.
273/929
That
was
exactly
what
happened—the conformists showed less
brain activity in the frontal, decision-
making regions and more in the areas
of the brain associated with perception.
Peer pressure, in other words, is not
only
unpleasant,
but
can
actually
change your view of a problem.
These
early
findings
suggest
that
groups
are
like
mind-altering
sub-
stances. If the group thinks the answer
is A, you’re much more likely to believe
that A is correct, too. It’s not that
you’re saying consciously, “Hmm, I’m
not sure, but they all think the answer’s
A, so I’ll go with that.” Nor are you say-
ing, “I want them to like me, so I’ll just
pretend that the answer’s A.” No, you
are doing something much more unex-
pected—and dangerous. Most of Berns’s
volunteers reported having gone along
with the group because “they thought
274/929
that they had arrived serendipitously at
the same correct answer.” They were
utterly blind, in other words, to how
much their peers had influenced them.
What does this have to do with social
fear? Well, remember that the volun-
teers in the Asch and Berns studies
didn’t always conform. Sometimes they
picked the right answer despite their
peers’ influence. And Berns and his
team found something very interesting
about these moments. They were linked
to heightened activation in the amyg-
dala, a small organ in the brain associ-
ated with upsetting emotions such as
the fear of rejection.
Berns refers to this as “the pain of in-
dependence,” and it has serious implic-
ations. Many of our most important
civic institutions, from elections to jury
trials to the very idea of majority rule,
depend on dissenting voices. But when
275/929
the group is literally capable of chan-
ging
our
perceptions,
and
when
to
stand alone is to activate primitive,
powerful, and unconscious feelings of
rejection, then the health of these insti-
tutions seems far more vulnerable than
we think.
But of course I’ve been simplifying the
case against face-to-face collaboration.
Steve Wozniak collaborated with Steve
Jobs, after all; without their pairing,
there would be no Apple today. Every
pair bond between mother and father,
between parent and child, is an act of
creative collaboration. Indeed, studies
show that face-to-face interactions cre-
ate trust in a way that online interac-
tions can’t. Research also suggests that
276/929
population density is correlated with
innovation; despite the advantages of
quiet walks in the woods, people in
crowded cities benefit from the web of
interactions that urban life offers.
I have experienced this phenomenon
personally. When I was getting ready to
write this book, I carefully set up my
home office, complete with uncluttered
desk, file cabinets, free counter space,
and plenty of natural light—and then
felt too cut off from the world to type a
single keystroke there. Instead, I wrote
most of this book on a laptop at my fa-
vorite
densely
packed
neighborhood
café. I did this for exactly the reasons
that champions of the New Groupthink
might suggest: the mere presence of
other people helped my mind to make
associative leaps. The coffee shop was
full of people bent over their own com-
puters, and if the expressions of rapt
277/929
concentration on their faces were any
indication, I wasn’t the only one getting
a lot of work done.
But the café worked as my office be-
cause it had specific attributes that are
absent from many modern schools and
workplaces. It was social, yet its casual,
come-and-go-as-you-please nature left
me
free
from
unwelcome
entangle-
ments and able to “deliberately prac-
tice” my writing. I could toggle back
and forth between observer and social
actor as much as I wanted. I could also
control my environment. Each day I
chose the location of my table—in the
center of the room or along the peri-
meter—depending on whether I wanted
to be seen as well as to see. And I had
the option to leave whenever I wanted
peace and quiet to edit what I’d written
that day. Usually I was ready to exer-
cise
this
right
after
only
a
few
278/929
hours—not the eight, ten, or fourteen
hours that many office dwellers put in.
The way forward, I’m suggesting, is
not to stop collaborating face-to-face,
but to refine the way we do it. For one
thing,
we
should
actively
seek
out
symbiotic introvert-extrovert relation-
ships, in which leadership and other
tasks are divided according to people’s
natural
strengths
and temperaments.
The most effective teams are composed
of a healthy mix of introverts and ex-
troverts, studies show, and so are many
leadership structures.
We also need to create settings in
which people are free to circulate in a
shifting kaleidoscope
of interactions,
and
to
disappear
into
their
private
workspaces when they want to focus or
simply be alone. Our schools should
teach children the skills to work with
others—cooperative
learning
can
be
279/929
effective when practiced well and in
moderation—but
also
the
time
and
training they need to deliberately prac-
tice on their own. It’s also vital to re-
cognize that many people—especially
introverts like Steve Wozniak—need ex-
tra quiet and privacy in order to do
their best work.
Some companies are starting to un-
derstand
the
value
of
silence
and
solitude,
and
are
creating
“flexible”
open plans that offer a mix of solo
workspaces, quiet zones, casual meet-
ing areas, cafés, reading rooms, com-
puter hubs, and even “streets” where
people can chat casually with each oth-
er without interrupting others’ work-
flow. At Pixar Animation Studios, the
sixteen-acre campus is built around a
football-field-sized
atrium
housing
mailboxes, a cafeteria, and even bath-
rooms. The idea is to encourage as
280/929
many casual, chance encounters as pos-
sible. At the same time, employees are
encouraged to make their individual of-
fices, cubicles, desks, and work areas
their own and to decorate them as they
wish. Similarly, at Microsoft, many em-
ployees enjoy their own private offices,
yet they come with sliding doors, mov-
able walls, and other features that al-
low occupants to decide when they
want to collaborate and when they
need private time to think. These kinds
of diverse workspaces benefit introverts
as
well
as
extroverts,
the
systems
design researcher Matt Davis told me,
because they offer more spaces to re-
treat
to
than
traditional
open-plan
offices.
I suspect that Wozniak himself would
approve of these developments. Before
he created the Apple PC, Woz designed
calculators at Hewlett-Packard, a job he
281/929
loved in part because HP made it so
easy to chat with others. Every day at
10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. management
wheeled
in
donuts
and
coffee,
and
people would socialize and swap ideas.
What set these interactions apart was
how low-key and relaxed they were. In
iWoz, he recalls HP as a meritocracy
where it didn’t matter what you looked
like, where there was no premium on
playing social games, and where no one
pushed him from his beloved engineer-
ing work into management. That was
what collaboration meant for Woz: the
ability to share a donut and a brain-
wave with his laid-back, nonjudgment-
al,
poorly
dressed
colleagues—who
minded not a whit when he disap-
peared into his cubicle to get the real
work done.

—ROBERT RUBIN, In an Uncertain
World
ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO
It’s 2:00 a.m., I can’t sleep, and I want
to die.
I’m not normally the suicidal type,
but this is the night before a big speech,
and my mind races with horrifying
what-if propositions. What if my mouth
dries up and I can’t get any words out?
What if I bore the audience? What if I
throw up onstage?
My boyfriend (now my husband),
Ken, watches me toss and turn. He’s be-
wildered by my distress. A former UN
peacekeeper, he once was ambushed in
Somalia, yet I don’t think he felt as
scared then as I do now.
“Try to think of happy things,” he
says, caressing my forehead.
I stare at the ceiling, tears welling.
What happy things? Who could be
happy
in
a
world
of
podiums
and
microphones?
“There are a billion people in China
who don’t give a rat’s ass about your
speech,” Ken offers sympathetically.
This helps, for approximately five
seconds. I turn over and watch the
alarm clock. Finally it’s six thirty. At
least the worst part, the night-before
285/929
part, is over; this time tomorrow, I’ll be
free. But first I have to get through
today. I dress grimly and put on a coat.
Ken hands me a sports water bottle
filled with Baileys Irish Cream. I’m not
a big drinker, but I like Baileys because
it tastes like a chocolate milkshake.
“Drink this fifteen minutes before you
go on,” he says, kissing me good-bye.
I take the elevator downstairs and
settle into the car that waits to ferry me
to
my
destination,
a
big
corporate
headquarters in suburban New Jersey.
The drive gives me plenty of time to
wonder how I allowed myself to get in-
to this situation. I recently left my job
as a Wall Street lawyer to start my own
consulting
firm. Mostly I’ve worked
one-on-one or in small groups, which
feels comfortable. But when an ac-
quaintance who is general counsel at a
big media company asked me to run a
286/929
seminar for his entire executive team, I
agreed—enthusiastically,
even!—for
reasons I can’t fathom now. I find my-
self praying for calamity—a flood or a
small earthquake, maybe—anything so
I don’t have to go through with this.
Then I feel guilty for involving the rest
of the city in my drama.
The car pulls up at the client’s office
and I step out, trying to project the
peppy
self-assurance
of
a
successful
consultant. The event organizer escorts
me to the auditorium. I ask for direc-
tions to the bathroom, and, in the pri-
vacy of the stall, gulp from the water
bottle. For a few moments I stand still,
waiting for the alcohol to work its ma-
gic. But nothing happens—I’m still ter-
rified. Maybe I should take another
swig. No, it’s only nine in the morn-
ing—what if they smell the liquor on
my breath? I reapply my lipstick and

make my way back to the event room,
where I arrange my notecards at the
podium
as
the
room
fills
with
important-looking
businesspeople.
Whatever you do, try not to vomit, I tell
myself.
Some of the executives glance up at
me, but most of them stare fixedly at
their BlackBerrys. Clearly, I’m taking
them away from very pressing work.
How am I going to hold their attention
long enough for them to stop pounding
out urgent communiqués into their tiny
typewriters?
I
vow,
right
then
and
there, that I will never make another
speech.
Well, since then I’ve given plenty of
them. I haven’t completely overcome
288/929
my anxiety, but over the years I’ve dis-
covered strategies that can help anyone
with stage fright who needs to speak in
public. More about that in chapter 5.
In the meantime, I’ve told you my
tale of abject terror because it lies at
the heart of some of my most urgent
questions about introversion. On some
deep level, my fear of public speaking
seems connected to other aspects of my
personality that I appreciate, especially
my love of all things gentle and cereb-
ral. This strikes me as a not-uncommon
constellation of traits. But are they
truly connected, and if so, how? Are
they the result of “nurture”—the way I
was raised? Both of my parents are soft-
spoken, reflective types; my mother
hates public speaking too. Or are they
my “nature”—something deep in my
genetic makeup?
289/929
I’ve been puzzling over these ques-
tions for my entire adult life. For-
tunately, so have researchers at Har-
vard, where scientists are probing the
human brain in an attempt to discover
the
biological
origins
of
human
temperament.
One such scientist is an eighty-two-
year-old man named Jerome Kagan,
one of the great developmental psycho-
logists of the twentieth century. Kagan
devoted his career to studying the emo-
tional and cognitive development of
children. In a series of groundbreaking
longitudinal studies, he followed chil-
dren from infancy through adolescence,
documenting
their
physiologies
and
personalities along the way. Longitud-
inal studies like these are time-consum-
ing, expensive, and therefore rare—but
when they pay off, as Kagan’s did, they
pay off big.
290/929
For one of those studies, launched in
1989 and still ongoing, Professor Kagan
and his team gathered five hundred
four-month-old infants in his Laborat-
ory for Child Development at Harvard,
predicting they’d be able to tell, on the
strength of a forty-five-minute evalu-
ation, which babies were more likely to
turn into introverts or extroverts. If
you’ve
seen
a
four-month-old
baby
lately, this may seem an audacious
claim. But Kagan had been studying
temperament for a long time, and he
had a theory.
Kagan and his team exposed the four-
month-olds to a carefully chosen set of
new
experiences.
The
infants
heard
tape-recorded voices and balloons pop-
ping, saw colorful mobiles dance before
their eyes, and inhaled the scent of al-
cohol on cotton swabs. They had wildly
varying reactions to the new stimuli.
291/929
About
20
percent
cried
lustily
and
pumped their arms and legs. Kagan
called this group “high-reactive.” About
40 percent stayed quiet and placid,
moving their arms or legs occasionally,
but
without
all
the
dramatic
limb-
pumping.
This
group
Kagan
called
“low-reactive.” The remaining 40 per-
cent fell between these two extremes.
In a startlingly counterintuitive hypo-
thesis, Kagan predicted that it was the
infants in the high-reactive group—the
lusty
arm-pumpers—who
were
most
likely to grow into quiet teenagers.
When they were two, four, seven,
and eleven years old, many of the chil-
dren returned to Kagan’s lab for follow-
up testing of their reactions to new
people and events. At the age of two,
the children met a lady wearing a gas
mask and a lab coat, a man dressed in a
clown costume, and a radio-controlled
292/929
robot. At seven, they were asked to
play with kids they’d never met before.
At eleven, an unfamiliar adult inter-
viewed them about their personal lives.
Kagan’s team observed how the chil-
dren reacted to these strange situations,
noting their body language and record-
ing how often and spontaneously they
laughed, talked, and smiled. They also
interviewed the kids and their parents
about what the children were like out-
side the laboratory. Did they prefer one
or two close friends to a merry band?
Did they like visiting new places? Were
they risk-takers or were they more cau-
tious? Did they consider themselves shy
or bold?
Many of the children turned out ex-
actly as Kagan had expected. The high-
reactive infants, the 20 percent who’d
hollered at the mobiles bobbing above
their heads, were more likely to have
293/929
developed serious, careful personalities.
The
low-reactive
infants—the
quiet
ones—were more likely to have become
relaxed and confident types. High and
low reactivity tended to correspond, in
other words, to introversion and extro-
version. As Kagan mused in his 1998
book, Galen’s Prophecy, “Carl Jung’s de-
scriptions of the introvert and extro-
vert, written over seventy-five years
ago, apply with uncanny accuracy to a
proportion of our high- and low-react-
ive adolescents.”
Kagan describes two of those adoles-
cents—reserved Tom and extroverted
Ralph—and the differences between the
two are striking. Tom, who was unusu-
ally shy as a child, is good at school,
watchful and quiet, devoted to his girl-
friend and parents, prone to worry, and
loves learning on his own and thinking
about intellectual problems. He plans to
294/929
be a scientist. “Like … other famous in-
troverts who were shy children,” writes
Kagan, comparing Tom to T. S. Eliot
and the mathematician-philosopher Al-
fred
North
Whitehead,
Tom
“has
chosen a life of the mind.”
Ralph, in contrast, is relaxed and self-
assured. He engages the interviewer
from Kagan’s team as a peer, not as an
authority figure twenty-five years his
senior. Though Ralph is very bright, he
recently failed his English and science
classes
because
he’d
been
goofing
around. But nothing much bothers Ral-
ph. He admits his flaws cheerfully.
Psychologists often discuss the differ-
ence between “temperament” and “per-
sonality.” Temperament refers to in-
born, biologically based behavioral and
emotional patterns that are observable
in infancy and early childhood; person-
ality is the complex brew that emerges
295/929
after cultural influence and personal ex-
perience are thrown into the mix. Some
say that temperament is the foundation,
and personality is the building. Kagan’s
work helped link certain infant tem-
peraments with adolescent personality
styles like those of Tom and Ralph.
But how did Kagan know that the arm-
thrashing infants would likely turn into
cautious, reflective teens like Tom, or
that the quiet babies were more likely
to
become
forthright,
too-cool-for-
school Ralphs? The answer lies in their
physiologies.
In addition to observing the chil-
dren’s behaviors in strange situations,
Kagan’s
team
measured
their
heart
rates,
blood
pressure,
finger
296/929
temperature, and other properties of
the nervous system. Kagan chose these
measures because they’re believed to be
controlled by a potent organ inside the
brain called the amygdala. The amyg-
dala is located deep in the limbic sys-
tem, an ancient brain network found
even in primitive animals like mice and
rats. This network—sometimes called
the “emotional brain”—underlies many
of the basic instincts we share with
these animals, such as appetite, sex
drive, and fear.
The amygdala serves as the brain’s
emotional switchboard,
receiving in-
formation from the senses and then sig-
naling the rest of the brain and nervous
system how to respond. One of its func-
tions is to instantly detect new or
threatening
things
in
the
environ-
ment—from an airborne Frisbee to a
hissing
serpent—and
send
rapid-fire
297/929
signals through the body that trigger
the fight-or-flight response. When the
Frisbee looks like it’s headed straight
for your nose, it’s your amygdala that
tells you to duck. When the rattlesnake
prepares to bite, it’s the amygdala that
makes sure you run.
Kagan hypothesized that infants born
with an especially excitable amygdala
would wiggle and howl when shown
unfamiliar objects—and grow up to be
children who were more likely to feel
vigilant when meeting new people. And
this is just what he found. In other
words,
the
four-month-olds
who
thrashed their arms like punk rockers
did so not because they were extroverts
in the making, but because their little
bodies
reacted
strongly—they
were
“high-reactive”—to new sights, sounds,
and smells. The quiet infants were si-
lent
not
because
they
were
future
298/929
introverts—just the opposite—but be-
cause they had nervous systems that
were unmoved by novelty.
The more reactive a child’s amyg-
dala, the higher his heart rate is likely
to be, the more widely dilated his eyes,
the tighter his vocal cords, the more
cortisol
(a
stress
hormone)
in
his
saliva—the more jangled he’s likely to
feel when he confronts something new
and stimulating. As high-reactive in-
fants grow up, they continue to con-
front the unknown in many different
contexts, from visiting an amusement
park for the first time to meeting new
classmates on the first day of kinder-
garten. We tend to notice most a child’s
reaction
to
unfamiliar
people—how
does he behave on the first day of
school? Does she seem uncertain at
birthday parties full of kids she doesn’t
know? But what we’re really observing
299/929
is a child’s sensitivity to novelty in gen-
eral, not just to people.
High- and low-reactivity are probably
not the only biological routes to intro-
version
and
extroversion.
There
are
plenty of introverts who do not have
the sensitivity of a classic high-reactive,
and a small percentage of high-react-
ives grow up to be extroverts. Still,
Kagan’s decades-long series of discover-
ies mark a dramatic breakthrough in
our understanding of these personality
styles—including the value judgments
we
make.
Extroverts
are
sometimes
credited
with
being
“pro-so-
cial”—meaning
caring
about
oth-
ers—and
introverts
disparaged
as
people who don’t like people. But the
reactions of the infants in Kagan’s tests
had nothing to do with people. These
babies were shouting (or not shouting)
over Q-tips. They were pumping their
300/929
limbs (or staying calm) in response to
popping balloons. The high-reactive ba-
bies were not misanthropes in the mak-
ing; they were simply sensitive to their
environments.
Indeed, the sensitivity of these chil-
dren’s nervous systems seems to be
linked not only to noticing scary things,
but to noticing in general. High-react-
ive children pay what one psychologist
calls “alert attention” to people and
things. They literally use more eye
movements
than
others
to
compare
choices before making a decision. It’s as
if they process more deeply—some-
times consciously, sometimes not—the
information they take in about the
world. In one early series of studies,
Kagan asked a group of first-graders to
play a visual matching game. Each
child was shown a picture of a teddy
bear sitting on a chair, alongside six
301/929
other
similar
pictures,
only
one
of
which was an exact match. The high-re-
active children spent more time than
others considering all the alternatives,
and were more likely to make the right
choice. When Kagan asked these same
kids to play word games, he found that
they also read more accurately than im-
pulsive children did.
High-reactive kids also tend to think
and feel deeply about what they’ve no-
ticed, and to bring an extra degree of
nuance to everyday experiences. This
can be expressed in many different
ways. If the child is socially oriented,
she may spend a lot of time pondering
her observations of others—why Jason
didn’t want to share his toys today,
why Mary got so mad at Nicholas when
he bumped into her accidentally. If he
has a particular interest—in solving
puzzles,
making
art,
building
sand
302/929
castles—he’ll
often
concentrate
with
unusual
intensity.
If
a
high-reactive
toddler breaks another child’s toy by
mistake, studies show, she often experi-
ences a more intense mix of guilt and
sorrow
than
a
lower-reactive
child
would. All kids notice their environ-
ments and feel emotions, of course, but
high-reactive kids seem to see and feel
things more. If you ask a high-reactive
seven-year-old how a group of kids
should share a coveted toy, writes the
science journalist Winifred Gallagher,
he’ll tend to come up with sophisticated
strategies like “Alphabetize their last
names, and let the person closest to A
go first.”
“Putting theory into practice is hard
for them,” writes Gallagher, “because
their sensitive natures and elaborate
schemes are unsuited to the heterogen-
eous rigors of the schoolyard.” Yet as
303/929
we’ll see in the chapters to come, these
traits—alertness, sensitivity to nuance,
complex emotionality—turn out to be
highly underrated powers.
Kagan has given us painstakingly docu-
mented evidence that high reactivity is
one
biological
basis
of
introversion
(we’ll explore another likely route in
chapter 7), but his findings are power-
ful in part because they confirm what
we’ve sensed all along. Some of Kagan’s
studies even venture into the realm of
cultural myth. For example, he be-
lieves, based on his data, that high re-
activity
is
associated
with
physical
traits such as blue eyes, allergies, and
hay fever, and that high-reactive men
are more likely than others to have a
304/929
thin body and narrow face. Such con-
clusions are speculative and call to
mind the nineteenth-century practice of
divining a man’s soul from the shape of
his skull. But whether or not they turn
out to be accurate, it’s interesting that
these are just the physical characterist-
ics we give fictional characters when
we want to suggest that they’re quiet,
introverted, cerebral. It’s as if these
physiological
tendencies
are
buried
deep in our cultural unconscious.
Take Disney movies, for example:
Kagan and his colleagues speculate that
Disney animators unconsciously under-
stood high reactivity when they drew
sensitive figures like Cinderella, Pinoc-
chio, and Dopey with blue eyes, and
brasher
characters
like
Cinderella’s
stepsisters, Grumpy, and Peter Pan with
darker eyes. In many books, Hollywood
films, and TV shows, too, the stock
305/929
character
of
a
reedy,
nose-blowing
young man is shorthand for the hapless
but
thoughtful
kid
who
gets
good
grades, is a bit overwhelmed by the so-
cial whirl, and is talented at introspect-
ive activities like poetry or astrophys-
ics. (Think Ethan Hawke in Dead Poets
Society.) Kagan even speculates that
some men prefer women with fair skin
and blue eyes because they uncon-
sciously code them as sensitive.
Other studies of personality also sup-
port the premise that extroversion and
introversion are physiologically, even
genetically, based. One of the most
common
ways
of
untangling
nature
from nurture is to compare the person-
ality traits of identical and fraternal
twins. Identical twins develop from a
single fertilized egg and therefore have
exactly the same genes, while fraternal
twins come from separate eggs and
306/929
share only 50 percent of their genes on
average. So if you measure introversion
or extroversion levels in pairs of twins
and find more correlation in identical
twins than in fraternal pairs—which
scientists do, in study after study, even
of
twins
raised
in
separate
house-
holds—you
can
reasonably
conclude
that the trait has some genetic basis.
None of these studies is perfect, but
the results have consistently suggested
that introversion and extroversion, like
other major personality traits such as
agreeableness
and
conscientiousness,
are about 40 to 50 percent heritable.
But are biological explanations for in-
troversion wholly satisfying? When I
first
read
Kagan’s
book
Galen’s
Prophecy,
I
was
so
excited
that
I
couldn’t sleep. Here, inside these pages,
were my friends, my family, myself—all
of humanity, in fact!—neatly sorted
307/929
through
the
prism
of
a
quiescent
nervous system versus a reactive one. It
was as if centuries of philosophical in-
quiry into the mystery of human per-
sonality had led to this shining moment
of scientific clarity. There was an easy
answer to the nature-nurture question
after all—we are born with prepack-
aged
temperaments
that
powerfully
shape our adult personalities.
But it couldn’t be that simple—could
it? Can we really reduce an introverted
or
extroverted
personality
to
the
nervous system its owner was born
with? I would guess that I inherited a
high-reactive nervous system, but my
mother insists I was an easy baby, not
the kind to kick and wail over a popped
balloon. I’m prone to wild flights of
self-doubt, but I also have a deep well
of courage in my own convictions. I
feel horribly uncomfortable on my first
308/929
day in a foreign city, but I love to
travel. I was shy as a child, but have
outgrown the worst of it. Furthermore,
I don’t think these contradictions are so
unusual; many people have dissonant
aspects
to
their
personalities.
And
people change profoundly over time,
don’t they? What about free will—do
we have no control over who we are,
and whom we become?
I decided to track down Professor
Kagan to ask him these questions in
person. I felt drawn to him not only be-
cause his research findings were so
compelling, but also because of what he
represents in the great nature-nurture
debate. He’d launched his career in
1954 staunchly on the side of nurture,
a view in step with the scientific estab-
lishment of the day. Back then, the idea
of inborn temperament was political
dynamite, evoking the specter of Nazi
309/929
eugenics and white supremacism. By
contrast, the notion of children as blank
slates for whom anything was possible
appealed
to
a
nation
built
on
democracy.
But Kagan had changed his mind
along the way. “I have been dragged,
kicking and screaming, by my data,” he
says now, “to acknowledge that tem-
perament
is
more
powerful
than
I
thought and wish to believe.” The pub-
lication of his early findings on high-re-
active children in Science magazine in
1988 helped to legitimize the idea of
inborn temperament, partly because his
“nurturist” reputation was so strong.
If anyone could help me untangle the
nature-nurture question, I hoped, it was
Jerry Kagan.
310/929
Kagan ushers me inside his office in
Harvard’s William James Hall, survey-
ing me unblinkingly as I sit down: not
unkind, but definitely discerning. I had
imagined him as a gentle, white-lab-
coated scientist in a cartoon, pouring
chemicals from one test tube to another
until—poof! Now, Susan, you know ex-
actly who you are. But this isn’t the
mild-mannered old professor I’d ima-
gined. Ironically for a scientist whose
books are infused with humanism and
who describes himself as having been
an anxious, easily frightened boy, I find
him downright intimidating. I kick off
our interview by asking a background
question whose premise he disagrees
with. “No, no, no!” he thunders, as if I
weren’t sitting just across from him.
The high-reactive side of my person-
ality kicks into full gear. I’m always
soft-spoken, but now I have to force my
311/929
voice to come out louder than a whis-
per (on the tape recording of our con-
versation, Kagan’s voice sounds boom-
ing
and
declamatory,
mine
much
quieter). I’m aware that I’m holding my
torso tensely, one of the telltale signs of
the high-reactive. It feels strange to
know that Kagan must be observing
this too—he says as much, nodding at
me as he notes that many high-react-
ives become writers or pick other intel-
lectual
vocations
where
“you’re
in
charge: you close the door, pull down
the shades and do your work. You’re
protected from encountering unexpec-
ted things.” (Those from less educated
backgrounds tend to become file clerks
and truck drivers, he says, for the same
reasons.)
I mention a little girl I know who is
“slow to warm up.” She studies new
people rather than greeting them; her
312/929
family goes to the beach every week-
end, but it takes her ages to dip a toe
into the surf. A classic high-reactive, I
remark.
“No!” Kagan exclaims. “Every beha-
vior has more than one cause. Don’t
ever forget that! For every child who’s
slow to warm up, yes, there will be
statistically
more
high-reactives,
but
you can be slow to warm up because of
how you spent the first three and a half
years of your life! When writers and
journalists talk, they want to see a one-
to-one relationship—one behavior, one
cause. But it’s really important that you
see, for behaviors like slow-to-warm-
up,
shyness,
impulsivity,
there
are
many routes to that.”
He reels off examples of environ-
mental factors that could produce an
introverted personality independently
of,
or
in
concert
with,
a
reactive
313/929
nervous system: A child might enjoy
having new ideas about the world, say,
so she spends a lot of time inside her
head. Or health problems might direct
a child inward, to what’s going on in-
side his body.
My fear of public speaking might be
equally complex. Do I dread it because
I’m a high-reactive introvert? Maybe
not. Some high-reactives love public
speaking and performing, and plenty of
extroverts
have
stage
fright;
public
speaking is the number-one fear in
America, far more common than the
fear of death. Public speaking phobia
has many causes, including early child-
hood setbacks, that have to do with our
unique personal histories, not inborn
temperament.
In fact, public speaking anxiety may
be primal and quintessentially human,
not limited to those of us born with a
314/929
high-reactive nervous system. One the-
ory, based on the writings of the so-
ciobiologist E. O. Wilson, holds that
when our ancestors lived on the savan-
nah, being watched intently meant only
one thing: a wild animal was stalking
us. And when we think we’re about to
be eaten, do we stand tall and hold
forth confidently? No. We run. In other
words, hundreds of thousands of years
of evolution urge us to get the hell off
the stage, where we can mistake the
gaze of the spectators for the glint in a
predator’s eye. Yet the audience expects
not only that we’ll stay put, but that
we’ll act relaxed and assured. This con-
flict between biology and protocol is
one reason that speechmaking can be
so fraught. It’s also why exhortations to
imagine the audience in the nude don’t
help nervous speakers; naked lions are
315/929
just as dangerous as elegantly dressed
ones.
But even though all human beings
may be prone to mistaking audience
members for predators, each of us has a
different threshold for triggering the
fight-or-flight response. How threaten-
ingly must the eyes of the audience
members narrow before you feel they’re
about to pounce? Does it happen before
you’ve even stepped onstage, or does it
take a few really good hecklers to trig-
ger that adrenaline rush? You can see
how a highly sensitive amygdala would
make you more susceptible to frowns
and bored sighs and people who check
their BlackBerrys while you’re in mid-
sentence. And indeed, studies do show
that introverts are significantly more
likely than extroverts to fear public
speaking.
316/929
Kagan tells me about the time he
watched a fellow scientist give a won-
derful talk at a conference. Afterward,
the speaker asked if they could have
lunch. Kagan agreed, and the scientist
proceeded to tell him that he gives lec-
tures every month and, despite his cap-
able stage persona, is terrified each
time. Reading Kagan’s work had had a
big impact on him, however.
“You
changed
my
life,”
he
told
Kagan. “All this time I’ve been blaming
my mother, but now I think I’m a high-
reactive.”
So am I introverted because I inherited
my
parents’
high
reactivity,
copied
their behaviors, or both? Remember
that the heritability statistics derived
317/929
from
twin
studies
show
that
introversion-extroversion is only 40 to
50 percent heritable. This means that,
in a group of people, on average half of
the variability in introversion-extrover-
sion is caused by genetic factors. To
make things even more complex, there
are probably many genes at work, and
Kagan’s framework of high reactivity is
likely one of many physiological routes
to
introversion.
Also,
averages
are
tricky. A heritability rate of 50 percent
doesn’t necessarily mean that my intro-
version is 50 percent inherited from my
parents, or that half of the difference in
extroversion between my best friend
and me is genetic. One hundred percent
of my introversion might come from
genes, or none at all—or more likely
some
unfathomable
combination
of
genes and experience. To ask whether
it’s nature or nurture, says Kagan, is
318/929
like asking whether a blizzard is caused
by temperature or humidity. It’s the in-
tricate interaction between the two that
makes us who we are.
So
perhaps
I’ve
been
asking
the
wrong question. Maybe the mystery of
what percent of personality is nature
and what percent nurture is less im-
portant than the question of how your
inborn temperament interacts with the
environment and with your own free
will. To what degree is temperament
destiny?
On the one hand, according to the
theory of gene-environment interaction,
people who inherit certain traits tend to
seek out life experiences that reinforce
those characteristics. The most low-re-
active kids, for example, court danger
from the time they’re toddlers, so that
by the time they grow up they don’t bat
an eye at grown-up-sized risks. They
319/929
“climb a few fences, become desensit-
ized, and climb up on the roof,” the late
psychologist David Lykken once ex-
plained in an Atlantic article. “They’ll
have all sorts of experiences that other
kids won’t. Chuck Yeager (the first pilot
to break the sound barrier) could step
down from the belly of the bomber into
the rocketship and push the button not
because he was born with that differ-
ence between him and me, but because
for the previous thirty years his tem-
perament impelled him to work his way
up from climbing trees through increas-
ing degrees of danger and excitement.”
Conversely,
high-reactive
children
may be more likely to develop into
artists and writers and scientists and
thinkers because their aversion to nov-
elty causes them to spend time inside
the
familiar—and
intellectually
fer-
tile—environment of their own heads.
320/929
“The university is filled with intro-
verts,” observes the psychologist Jerry
Miller, director of the Center for the
Child and the Family at the University
of Michigan. “The stereotype of the uni-
versity
professor
is
accurate
for
so
many people on campus. They like to
read; for them there’s nothing more ex-
citing than ideas. And some of this has
to do with how they spent their time
when they were growing up. If you
spend a lot of time charging around,
then you have less time for reading and
learning. There’s only so much time in
your life.”
On the other hand, there is also a
wide range of possible outcomes for
each temperament. Low-reactive, extro-
verted children, if raised by attentive
families in safe environments, can grow
up to be energetic achievers with big
personalities—the
Richard
Bransons
321/929
and Oprahs of this world. But give
those
same
children
negligent
care-
givers or a bad neighborhood, say some
psychologists, and they can turn into
bullies, juvenile delinquents, or crimin-
als. Lykken has controversially called
psychopaths and heroes “twigs on the
same genetic branch.”
Consider the mechanism by which
kids acquire their sense of right and
wrong. Many psychologists believe that
children develop a conscience when
they do something inappropriate and
are rebuked by their caregivers. Disap-
proval makes them feel anxious, and
since anxiety is unpleasant, they learn
to steer clear of antisocial behavior.
This is known as internalizing their par-
ents’ standards of conduct, and its core
is anxiety.
But what if some kids are less prone
to anxiety than others, as is true of
322/929
extremely low-reactive kids? Often the
best way to teach these children values
is to give them positive role models and
to channel their fearlessness into pro-
ductive activities. A low-reactive child
on an ice-hockey team enjoys his peers’
esteem when he charges at his oppon-
ents with a lowered shoulder, which is
a “legal” move. But if he goes too far,
raises his elbow, and gives another guy
a concussion, he lands in the penalty
box. Over time he learns to use his ap-
petite for risk and assertiveness wisely.
Now imagine this same child growing
up in a dangerous neighborhood with
few organized sports or other construct-
ive channels for his boldness. You can
see how he might fall into delinquency.
It may be that some disadvantaged kids
who get into trouble suffer not solely
from poverty or neglect, say those who
hold
this
view,
but
also
from
the
323/929
tragedy of a bold and exuberant tem-
perament deprived of healthy outlets.
The destinies of the most high-reactive
kids are also influenced by the world
around them—perhaps even more so
than for the average child, according to
a groundbreaking new theory dubbed
“the orchid hypothesis” by David Dobbs
in a wonderful article in The Atlantic.
This theory holds that many children
are like dandelions, able to thrive in
just about any environment. But others,
including the high-reactive types that
Kagan studied, are more like orchids:
they wilt easily, but under the right
conditions
can
grow
strong
and
magnificent.
324/929
According to Jay Belsky, a leading
proponent of this view and a psycho-
logy professor and child care expert at
the University of London, the reactivity
of these kids’ nervous systems makes
them quickly overwhelmed by child-
hood adversity, but also able to benefit
from a nurturing environment more
than other children do. In other words,
orchid children are more strongly af-
fected by all experience, both positive
and negative.
Scientists have known for a while
that high-reactive temperaments come
with risk factors. These kids are espe-
cially vulnerable to challenges like mar-
ital tension, a parent’s death, or abuse.
They’re more likely than their peers to
react to these events with depression,
anxiety, and shyness. Indeed, about a
quarter of Kagan’s high-reactive kids
suffer
from
some
degree
of
the
325/929
condition known as “social anxiety dis-
order,” a chronic and disabling form of
shyness.
What scientists haven’t realized until
recently is that these risk factors have
an upside. In other words, the sensitiv-
ities and the strengths are a package
deal.
High-reactive
kids
who
enjoy
good parenting, child care, and a stable
home environment tend to have fewer
emotional problems and more social
skills than their lower-reactive peers,
studies show. Often they’re exceedingly
empathic,
caring,
and
cooperative.
They work well with others. They are
kind,
conscientious,
and
easily
dis-
turbed by cruelty, injustice, and irre-
sponsibility. They’re successful at the
things that matter to them. They don’t
necessarily turn into class presidents or
stars of the school play, Belsky told me,
though this can happen, too: “For some
326/929
it’s becoming the leader of their class.
For others it takes the form of doing
well academically or being well-liked.”
The upsides of the high-reactive tem-
perament have been documented in ex-
citing research that scientists are only
now beginning to pull together. One of
the most interesting findings, also re-
ported in Dobbs’s Atlantic article, comes
from the world of rhesus monkeys, a
species that shares about 95 percent of
its DNA with humans and has elaborate
social structures that resemble our own.
In these monkeys as well as in hu-
mans, a gene known as the serotonin-
transporter (SERT) gene, or 5-HTTLPR,
helps to regulate the processing of sero-
tonin, a neurotransmitter that affects
mood. A particular variation, or allele,
of this gene, sometimes referred to as
the “short” allele, is thought to be asso-
ciated
with
high
reactivity
and
327/929
introversion, as well as a heightened
risk of depression in humans who have
had difficult lives. When baby monkeys
with a similar allele were subjected to
stress—in one experiment they were
taken from their mothers and raised as
orphans—they processed serotonin less
efficiently (a risk factor for depression
and anxiety) than monkeys with the
long allele who endured similar priva-
tions. But young monkeys with the
same risky genetic profile who were
raised by nurturing mothers did as well
as
or
better
than
their
long-allele
brethren—even those raised in simil-
arly secure environments—at key social
tasks, like finding playmates, building
alliances, and handling conflicts. They
often became leaders of their troops.
They also processed serotonin more
efficiently.
328/929
Stephen
Suomi,
the
scientist
who
conducted these studies, has speculated
that these high-reactive monkeys owed
their success to the enormous amounts
of time they spent watching rather than
participating in the group, absorbing on
a deep level the laws of social dynam-
ics. (This is a hypothesis that might
ring true to parents whose high-reactive
children hover observantly on the edges
of
their
peer
group,
sometimes
for
weeks or months, before edging suc-
cessfully inside.)
Studies in humans have found that
adolescent girls with the short allele of
the SERT gene are 20 percent more
likely to be depressed than long-allele
girls when exposed to stressful family
environments, but 25 percent less likely
to be depressed when raised in stable
homes. Similarly, short allele adults
have been shown to have more anxiety
329/929
in
the
evening
than
others
when
they’ve had stressful days, but less anxi-
ety on calm days. High-reactive four-
year-olds
give
more
pro-social
re-
sponses
than
other
children
when
presented with moral dilemmas—but
this difference remains at age five only
if their mothers used gentle, not harsh,
discipline. High-reactive children raised
in supportive environments are even
more resistant than other kids to the
common cold and other respiratory ill-
nesses,
but
get
sick
more
easily
if
they’re raised in stressful conditions.
The short allele of the SERT gene is also
associated with higher performance on
a wide range of cognitive tasks.
These findings are so dramatic that
it’s remarkable no one arrived at them
until recently. Remarkable, but perhaps
not surprising. Psychologists are trained
to
heal,
so
their
research
naturally
330/929
focuses on problems and pathology. “It
is almost as if, metaphorically speaking,
sailors are so busy—and wisely—look-
ing under the water line for extensions
of icebergs that could sink their ship,”
writes Belsky, “that they fail to appreci-
ate that by climbing on top of the ice-
berg it might prove possible to chart a
clear
passage
through
the
ice-laden
sea.”
The parents of high-reactive children
are exceedingly lucky, Belsky told me.
“The time and effort they invest will ac-
tually make a difference. Instead of see-
ing these kids as vulnerable to ad-
versity, parents should see them as mal-
leable—for worse, but also for better.”
He describes eloquently a high-reactive
child’s ideal parent: someone who “can
read your cues and respect your indi-
viduality; is warm and firm in placing
demands on you without being harsh or
331/929
hostile; promotes curiosity, academic
achievement, delayed gratification, and
self-control; and is not harsh, neglect-
ful, or inconsistent.” This advice is ter-
rific for all parents, of course, but it’s
crucial for raising a high-reactive child.
(If you think your child might be high-
reactive, you’re probably already ask-
ing yourself what else you can do to
cultivate your son or daughter. Chapter
11 has some answers.)
But even orchid children can with-
stand some adversity, Belsky says. Take
divorce. In general, it will disrupt orch-
id kids more than others: “If the parents
squabble a lot, and put their kid in the
middle, then watch out—this is the kid
who will succumb.” But if the divorcing
parents get along, if they provide their
child with the other psychological nu-
trients he needs, then even an orchid
child can do just fine.
332/929
Most people would appreciate the
flexibility of this message, I think; few
of us had problem-free childhoods.
But there’s another kind of flexibility
that we all hope applies to the question
of who we are and what we become.
We want the freedom to map our own
destinies. We want to preserve the ad-
vantageous
aspects
of
our
tempera-
ments and improve, or even discard,
the ones we dislike—such as a horror of
public speaking. In addition to our in-
born temperaments, beyond the luck of
the draw of our childhood experience,
we
want
to
believe
that
we—as
adults—can shape our selves and make
what we will of our lives.
Can we?

The Role of Free Will (and the Secret of
Public Speaking for Introverts)
Enjoyment appears at the boundary

—MIHALY CSIKSZENTMIHALYI
Deep inside the bowels of the Athinoula
A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Ima-
ging at Massachusetts General Hospital,
the hallways are nondescript, dingy
even. I’m standing outside the locked
door of a windowless room with Dr.
Carl
Schwartz,
the
director
of
the
Developmental Neuroimaging and Psy-
chopathology Research Lab. Schwartz
has bright, inquisitive eyes, graying
brown hair, and a quietly enthusiastic
manner. Despite our unprepossessing
surroundings, he prepares with some
fanfare to unlock the door.
The room houses a multimillion-dol-
lar fMRI (functional magnetic reson-
ance
imaging)
machine,
which
has
made possible some of the greatest
breakthroughs in modern neuroscience.
An fMRI machine can measure which
parts of the brain are active when
you’re thinking a particular thought or
performing a specific task, allowing sci-
entists to perform the once unimagin-
able task of mapping the functions of
the human brain. A principal inventor
of
the
fMRI
technique,
says
Dr.
Schwartz, was a brilliant but unassum-
ing scientist named Kenneth Kwong,
335/929
who works inside this very building.
This whole place is full of quiet and
modest
people
doing
extraordinary
things, Schwartz adds, waving his hand
appreciatively at the empty hallway.
Before Schwartz opens the door, he
asks me to take off my gold hoop ear-
rings and set aside the metal tape re-
corder I’ve been using to record our
conversation. The magnetic field of the
fMRI
machine
is
100,000
times
stronger than the earth’s gravitational
pull—so strong, Schwartz says, that it
could rip the earrings right out of my
ears if they were magnetic and send
them flying across the room. I worry
about the metal fasteners of my bra,
but I’m too embarrassed to ask. I point
instead to my shoe buckle, which I fig-
ure has the same amount of metal as
the bra strap. Schwartz says it’s all
right, and we enter the room.
336/929
We gaze reverently at the fMRI scan-
ner, which looks like a gleaming rock-
etship lying on its side. Schwartz ex-
plains that he asks his subjects—who
are in their late teens—to lie down with
their heads in the scanner while they
look at photographs of faces and the
machine tracks how their brains re-
spond.
He’s
especially
interested
in
activity
in
the
amygdala—the
same
powerful organ inside the brain that
Kagan found played such an important
role in shaping some introverts’ and ex-
troverts’ personalities.
Schwartz is Kagan’s colleague and
protégé, and his work picks up just
where Kagan’s longitudinal studies of
personality left off. The infants Kagan
once categorized as high- and low-re-
active
have
now
grown
up,
and
Schwartz is using the fMRI machine to
peer inside their brains. Kagan followed
337/929
his subjects from infancy into adoles-
cence, but Schwartz wanted to see what
happened to them after that. Would the
footprint of temperament be detectable,
all those years later, in the adult brains
of Kagan’s high- and low-reactive in-
fants? Or would it have been erased by
some combination of environment and
conscious effort?
Interestingly,
Kagan
cautioned
Schwartz against doing the study. In
the competitive field of science re-
search, you don’t want to waste time
conducting studies that may not yield
significant findings. And Kagan worried
that
there
were
no
results
to
be
found—that the link between tempera-
ment and destiny would be severed by
the time an infant reached adulthood.
“He was trying to take care of me,”
Schwartz tells me. “It was an interest-
ing paradox. Because here Jerry was
338/929
doing all these early observations of in-
fants, and seeing that it wasn’t just
their social behavior that was different
in
the
extremes—everything
about
these kids was different. Their eyes
dilated more widely when they were
solving problems, their vocal cords be-
came more tense while uttering words,
their heart rate patterns were unique:
there were all these channels that sug-
gested there was something different
physiologically about these kids. And I
think, in spite of this, because of his in-
tellectual heritage, he had the feeling
that environmental factors are so com-
plex that it would be really hard to pick
up that footprint of temperament later
in life.”
But Schwartz, who believes that he’s
a high-reactive himself and was draw-
ing partly on his own experience, had a
hunch that he’d find that footprint even
339/929
farther along the longitudinal timeline
than Kagan had.
He demonstrates his research by al-
lowing me to act as if I were one of his
subjects, albeit not inside the fMRI
scanner. As I sit at a desk, a computer
monitor flashes photos at me, one after
another, each showing an unfamiliar
face:
disembodied
black-and-white
heads floating against a dark back-
ground. I think I can feel my pulse
quicken as the photos start coming at
me faster and faster. I also notice that
Schwartz has slipped in some repeats
and that I feel more relaxed as the faces
start to look familiar. I describe my re-
actions to Schwartz, who nods. The
slide show is designed, he says, to mim-
ic an environment that corresponds to
the sense that high-reactive people get
when they walk into a crowded room of
340/929
strangers and feel “Geez! Who are these
people?”
I wonder if I’m imagining my reac-
tions,
or
exaggerating
them,
but
Schwartz tells me that he’s gotten back
the first set of data on a group of high-
reactive children Kagan studied from
four months of age—and sure enough,
the amygdalae of those children, now
grown up, had turned out to be more
sensitive to the pictures of unfamiliar
faces than did the amygdalae of those
who’d been bold toddlers. Both groups
reacted to the pictures, but the formerly
shy kids reacted more. In other words,
the footprint of a high- or low-reactive
temperament never disappeared in adult-
hood. Some high-reactives grew into so-
cially fluid teenagers who were not out-
wardly rattled by novelty, but they nev-
er shed their genetic inheritance.
341/929
Schwartz’s
research
suggests
something important: we can stretch
our personalities, but only up to a
point. Our inborn temperaments influ-
ence us, regardless of the lives we lead.
A sizable part of who we are is or-
dained by our genes, by our brains, by
our nervous systems. And yet the elasti-
city that Schwartz found in some of the
high-reactive teens also suggests the
converse: we have free will and can use
it to shape our personalities.
These seem like contradictory prin-
ciples, but they are not. Free will can
take us far, suggests Dr. Schwartz’s re-
search, but it cannot carry us infinitely
beyond our genetic limits. Bill Gates is
never going to be Bill Clinton, no mat-
ter how he polishes his social skills, and
Bill Clinton can never be Bill Gates, no
matter how much time he spends alone
with a computer.
342/929
We might call this the “rubber band
theory” of personality. We are like rub-
ber bands at rest. We are elastic and
can stretch ourselves, but only so much.
To understand why this might be so for
high-reactives, it helps to look at what
happens in the brain when we greet a
stranger at a cocktail party. Remember
that the amygdala, and the limbic sys-
tem of which it’s a key part, is an an-
cient part of the brain—so old that
primitive mammals have their own ver-
sions of this system. But as mammals
became more complex, an area of the
brain called the neocortex developed
around the limbic system. The neocor-
tex, and particularly the frontal cortex
in humans, performs an astonishing
343/929
array of functions, from deciding which
brand of toothpaste to buy, to planning
a meeting, to pondering the nature of
reality. One of these functions is to
soothe unwarranted fears.
If you were a high-reactive baby,
then your amygdala may, for the rest of
your life, go a bit wild every time you
introduce yourself to a stranger at a
cocktail party. But if you feel relatively
skilled in company, that’s partly be-
cause your frontal cortex is there to tell
you to calm down, extend a handshake,
and smile. In fact, a recent fMRI study
shows that when people use self-talk to
reassess upsetting situations, activity in
their prefrontal cortex increases in an
amount correlated with a decrease of
activity in their amygdala.
But the frontal cortex isn’t all-power-
ful; it doesn’t switch the amygdala off
altogether.
In
one
study,
scientists
344/929
conditioned a rat to associate a certain
sound with an electrical shock. Then
they played that sound over and over
again without administering the shock,
until the rats lost their fear.
But it turned out that this “unlearn-
ing” was not as complete as the scient-
ists first thought. When they severed
the neural
connections
between the
rats’ cortex and amygdala, the rats be-
came afraid of the sound again. This
was because the fear conditioning had
been suppressed by the activity of the
cortex, but was still present in the amy-
gdala. In humans with unwarranted
fears,
like
batophobia,
or
fear
of
heights,
the
same
thing
happens.
Repeated trips to the top of the Empire
State Building seem to extinguish the
fear, but it may come roaring back dur-
ing times of stress—when the cortex
345/929
has other things to do than soothe an
excitable amygdala.
This helps explain why many high-re-
active kids retain some of the fearful as-
pects of their temperament all the way
into adulthood, no matter how much
social experience they acquire or free
will they exercise. My colleague Sally is
a good example of this phenomenon.
Sally is a thoughtful and talented book
editor, a self-described shy introvert,
and one of the most charming and ar-
ticulate people I know. If you invite her
to a party, and later ask your other
guests whom they most enjoyed meet-
ing, chances are they’ll mention Sally.
She’s so sparkly, they’ll tell you. So
witty! So adorable!
Sally is conscious of how well she
comes across—you can’t be as appeal-
ing as she is without being aware of it.
But that doesn’t mean her amygdala
346/929
knows it. When she arrives at a party,
Sally often wishes she could hide be-
hind the nearest couch—until her pre-
frontal cortex takes over and she re-
members what a good conversationalist
she is. Even so, her amygdala, with its
lifetime of stored associations between
strangers and anxiety, sometimes pre-
vails. Sally admits that sometimes she
drives an hour to a party and then
leaves five minutes after arriving.
When I think of my own experiences
in light of Schwartz’s findings, I realize
it’s not true that I’m no longer shy; I’ve
just learned to talk myself down from
the ledge (thank you, prefrontal cor-
tex!). By now I do it so automatically
that I’m hardly aware it’s happening.
When I talk with a stranger or a group
of people, my smile is bright and my
manner
direct,
but
there’s
a
split
second that feels like I’m stepping onto
347/929
a high wire. By now I’ve had so many
thousands of social experiences that
I’ve learned that the high wire is a fig-
ment of my imagination, or that I won’t
die if I fall. I reassure myself so instant-
aneously that I’m barely aware I’m do-
ing it. But the reassurance process is
still
happening—and
occasionally
it
doesn’t work. The word that Kagan first
used to describe high-reactive people
was inhibited, and that’s exactly how I
still feel at some dinner parties.
This ability to stretch ourselves—within
limits—applies to extroverts, too. One
of my clients, Alison, is a business con-
sultant, mother, and wife with the kind
of
extroverted
personality—friendly,
forthright, perpetually on the go—that
348/929
makes people describe her as a “force
of nature.” She has a happy marriage,
two daughters she adores, and her own
consulting firm that she built from
scratch. She’s rightly proud of what
she’s accomplished in life.
But she hasn’t always felt so satisfied.
The
year
she
graduated
from
high
school, she took a good look at herself
and didn’t like what she saw. Alison is
extremely bright, but you couldn’t see
that from her high school transcript.
She’d had her heart set on attending an
Ivy League school, and had thrown that
chance away.
And she knew why. She’d spent high
school socializing—Alison was involved
in
practically
every
extracurricular
activity her school had to offer—and
that didn’t leave much time for aca-
demics. Partly she blamed her parents,
who were so proud of their daughter’s
349/929
social gifts that they hadn’t insisted she
study more. But mostly she blamed
herself.
As an adult, Alison is determined not
to make similar mistakes. She knows
how easy it would be to lose herself in
a whirl of PTA meetings and business
networking. So Alison’s solution is to
look
to
her
family
for
adaptive
strategies. She happens to be the only
child of two introverted parents, to be
married to an introvert, and to have a
younger daughter who is a strong intro-
vert herself.
Alison has found ways to tap into the
wavelength of the quiet types around
her. When she visits her parents, she
finds herself meditating and writing in
her journal, just the way her mother
does. At home she relishes peaceful
evenings with her homebody husband.
And her younger daughter, who enjoys
350/929
intimate backyard talks with her moth-
er, has Alison spending her afternoons
engaged in thoughtful conversation.
Alison has even created a network of
quiet, reflective friends. Although her
best friend in the world, Amy, is a
highly charged extrovert just like her,
most of her other friends are introverts.
“I
so
appreciate
people
who
listen
well,” says Alison. “They are the friends
I go have coffee with. They give me the
most spot-on observations. Sometimes I
haven’t
even
realized
I
was
doing
something counterproductive, and my
introverted
friends
will
say,
‘Here’s
what you’re doing, and here are fifteen
examples of when you did that same
thing,’
whereas
my
friend
Amy
wouldn’t even notice. But my introver-
ted friends are sitting back and ob-
serving, and we can really connect over
that.”
351/929
Alison remains her boisterous self,
but she has also discovered how to be,
and to benefit from, quiet.
Even though we can reach for the outer
limits of our temperaments, it can often
be better to situate ourselves squarely
inside our comfort zones.
Consider the story of my client Esth-
er, a tax lawyer at a large corporate law
firm. A tiny brunette with a springy
step and blue eyes as bright as head-
lamps, Esther was not shy and never
had been. But she was decidedly intro-
verted. Her favorite part of the day was
the quiet ten minutes when she walked
to the bus along the tree-lined streets of
her neighborhood. Her second favorite
352/929
part was when she got to close the door
to her office and dig into her work.
Esther had chosen her career well. A
mathematician’s daughter, she loved to
think about intimidatingly complex tax
problems, and could discuss them with
ease. (In chapter 7, I examine why in-
troverts
are
so
good
at
complex,
focused problem-solving.) She was the
youngest member of a close-knit work-
ing group operating inside a much lar-
ger law firm. This group comprised five
other tax lawyers, all of whom suppor-
ted one another’s careers. Esther’s work
consisted
of
thinking
deeply
about
questions that fascinated her and work-
ing closely with trusted colleagues.
But it happened that Esther’s small
group of tax lawyers periodically had to
give presentations to the rest of the law
firm. These talks were a source of
misery for Esther, not because she was
353/929
afraid of public speaking, but because
she wasn’t comfortable speaking extem-
poraneously.
Esther’s
colleagues,
in
contrast—all of whom happened to be
extroverts—were
spontaneous
talkers
who decided what they’d say on their
way to the presentation and were some-
how able to convey their thoughts in-
telligibly and engagingly by the time
they arrived.
Esther was fine if given a chance to
prepare, but sometimes her colleagues
failed to mention that they’d be deliver-
ing a talk until she arrived at work that
morning. She assumed that their ability
to speak improvisationally was a func-
tion of their superior understanding of
tax law and that, as she gained more
experience, she too would be able to
“wing it.” But as Esther became more
senior and more knowledgeable, she
still couldn’t do it.
354/929
To solve Esther’s problem, let’s focus
on another difference between intro-
verts and extroverts: their preference
for stimulation.
For several decades, beginning in the
late 1960s, an influential research psy-
chologist named Hans Eysenck hypo-
thesized that human beings seek “just
right” levels of stimulation—not too
much and not too little. Stimulation is
the amount of input we have coming in
from the outside world. It can take any
number of forms, from noise to social
life to flashing lights. Eysenck believed
that extroverts prefer more stimulation
than introverts do, and that this ex-
plained many of their differences: intro-
verts enjoy shutting the doors to their
offices and plunging into their work,
because for them this sort of quiet intel-
lectual activity is optimally stimulating,
while extroverts function best when
355/929
engaged
in
higher-wattage
activities
like
organizing
team-building
work-
shops or chairing meetings.
Eysenck also thought that the basis of
these differences might be found in a
brain structure called the ascending re-
ticular activating system (ARAS). The
ARAS is a part of the brain stem that
has
connections
leading
up
to
the
cerebral cortex and other parts of the
brain. The brain has excitatory mechan-
isms that cause us to feel awake, alert,
and energetic—“aroused,” in the par-
lance of psychologists. It also has calm-
ing mechanisms that do the opposite.
Eysenck speculated that the ARAS regu-
lates the balance between over- and
under-arousal
by
controlling
the
amount
of
sensory
stimulation
that
flows into the brain; sometimes the
channels are wide open, so a lot of
stimulation can get in, and sometimes
356/929
they’re constricted, so the brain is less
stimulated. Eysenck thought that the
ARAS functioned differently in intro-
verts and extroverts: introverts have
wide-open information channels, caus-
ing them to be flooded with stimulation
and
over-aroused,
while
extroverts
have tighter channels, making them
prone to under-arousal. Over-arousal
doesn’t produce anxiety so much as the
sense
that
you
can’t
think
straight—that you’ve had enough and
would like to go home now. Under-
arousal is something like cabin fever.
Not
enough
is
happening:
you
feel
itchy, restless, and sluggish, like you
need to get out of the house already.
Today we know that the reality is far
more complex. For one thing, the ARAS
doesn’t turn stimulation on and off like
a fire truck’s hose, flooding the entire
brain at once; different parts of the
357/929
brain are aroused more than others at
different
times.
Also,
high
arousal
levels in the brain don’t always correl-
ate with how aroused we feel. And
there are many different kinds of arous-
al: arousal by loud music is not the
same as arousal by mortar fire, which is
not the same as arousal by presiding at
a meeting; you might be more sensitive
to one form of stimulation than to an-
other. It’s also too simple to say that we
always seek moderate levels of arousal:
excited fans at a soccer game crave hy-
perstimulation, while people who visit
spas for relaxation treatments seek low
levels.
Still, more than a thousand studies
conducted by scientists worldwide have
tested Eysenck’s theory that cortical
arousal levels are an important clue to
the nature of introversion and extrover-
sion, and it appears to be what the
358/929
personality psychologist David Funder
calls
“half-right”—in
very
important
ways. Whatever the underlying cause,
there’s a host of evidence that intro-
verts are more sensitive than extroverts
to various kinds of stimulation, from
coffee to a loud bang to the dull roar of
a networking event—and that intro-
verts and extroverts often need very
different levels of stimulation to func-
tion at their best.
In one well-known experiment, dat-
ing all the way back to 1967 and still a
favorite in-class demonstration in psy-
chology courses, Eysenck placed lemon
juice on the tongues of adult introverts
and extroverts to find out who salivated
more. Sure enough, the introverts, be-
ing more aroused by sensory stimuli,
were the ones with the watery mouths.
In another famous study, introverts
and extroverts were asked to play a
359/929
challenging word game in which they
had to learn, through trial and error,
the governing principle of the game.
While playing, they wore headphones
that emitted random bursts of noise.
They were asked to adjust the volume
of their headsets up or down to the
level that was “just right.” On average,
the extroverts chose a noise level of 72
decibels, while the introverts selected
only 55 decibels. When working at the
volume that they had selected—loud
for the extroverts, quiet for the intro-
verts—the
two
types
were
about
equally aroused (as measured by their
heart rates and other indicators). They
also played equally well.
When the introverts were asked to
work at the noise level preferred by the
extroverts, and vice versa, everything
changed. Not only were the introverts
over-aroused by the loud noise, but they
360/929
also underperformed—taking an aver-
age of 9.1 trials rather than 5.8 to learn
the game. The opposite was true for the
extroverts—they
were
under-aroused
(and possibly bored) by the quieter
conditions, and took an average of 7.3
trials, compared with the 5.4 they’d av-
eraged under noisier conditions.
When combined with Kagan’s findings
on high reactivity, this line of studies
offers a very empowering lens through
which to view your personality. Once
you understand introversion and extro-
version as preferences for certain levels
of
stimulation,
you
can
begin
con-
sciously trying to situate yourself in en-
vironments favorable to your own per-
sonality—neither
overstimulating
nor
361/929
understimulating,
neither boring nor
anxiety-making. You can organize your
life in terms of what personality psy-
chologists call “optimal levels of arous-
al” and what I call “sweet spots,” and
by doing so feel more energetic and
alive than before.
Your sweet spot is the place where
you’re optimally stimulated. You prob-
ably seek it out already without being
aware that you’re doing so. Imagine
that you’re lying contentedly in a ham-
mock reading a great novel. This is a
sweet spot. But after half an hour you
realize that you’ve read the same sen-
tence five times; now you’re understim-
ulated. So you call a friend and go out
for brunch—in other words, you ratchet
up your stimulation level—and as you
laugh and gossip over blueberry pan-
cakes, you’re back, thank goodness, in-
side your sweet spot. But this agreeable
362/929
state lasts only until your friend—an
extrovert who needs much more stimu-
lation than you do—persuades you to
accompany her to a block party, where
you’re now confronted by loud music
and a sea of strangers.
Your friend’s neighbors seem affable
enough, but you feel pressured to make
small talk above the din of music.
Now—bang,
just
like
that—you’ve
fallen out of your sweet spot, except
this time you’re overstimulated. And
you’ll probably feel that way until you
pair off with someone on the periphery
of the party for an in-depth conversa-
tion, or bow out altogether and return
to your novel.
Imagine how much better you’ll be at
this sweet-spot game once you’re aware
of playing it. You can set up your work,
your hobbies, and your social life so
that you spend as much time inside
363/929
your sweet spot as possible. People who
are aware of their sweet spots have the
power to leave jobs that exhaust them
and start new and satisfying businesses.
They can hunt for homes based on the
temperaments
of
their
family
mem-
bers—with cozy window seats and oth-
er nooks and crannies for the intro-
verts,
and
large,
open
living-dining
spaces for the extroverts.
Understanding your sweet spot can
increase
your
satisfaction
in
every
arena of your life, but it goes even fur-
ther than that. Evidence suggests that
sweet spots can have life-or-death con-
sequences. According to a recent study
of
military
personnel
conducted
through the Walter Reed Army Institute
of Research, introverts function better
than extroverts when sleep deprived,
which is a cortically de-arousing condi-
tion (because losing sleep makes us less
364/929
alert, active, and energetic). Drowsy ex-
troverts behind the wheel should be es-
pecially careful—at least until they in-
crease their arousal levels by chugging
coffee or cranking up the radio. Con-
versely,
introverts
driving
in
loud,
overly
arousing
traffic
noise
should
work to stay focused, since the noise
may impair their thinking.
Now that we know about optimal
levels
of
stimulation,
Esther’s
prob-
lem—winging it at the podium—also
makes
sense.
Overarousal
interferes
with
attention
and
short-term
memory—key components of the abil-
ity to speak on the fly. And since public
speaking is an inherently stimulating
activity—even for those, like Esther,
who suffer no stage fright—introverts
can find their attention impaired just
when they need it most. Esther could
live
to
be
a
one-hundred-year-old
365/929
lawyer, in other words, the most know-
ledgeable practitioner in her field, and
she might never be comfortable speak-
ing extemporaneously. She might find
herself perpetually unable, at speech
time, to draw on the massive body of
data
sitting
inside
her
long-term
memory.
But once Esther understands herself,
she can insist to her colleagues that
they give her advance notice of any
speaking events. She can practice her
speeches and find herself well inside
her sweet spot when finally she reaches
the podium. She can prepare the same
way for client meetings, networking
events, even casual meetings with her
colleagues—any situation of heightened
intensity
in
which
her
short-term
memory and the ability to think on her
feet might be a little more comprom-
ised than usual.
366/929
Esther managed to solve her problem
from the comfort of her sweet spot. Yet
sometimes stretching beyond it is our
only choice. Some years ago I decided
that I wanted to conquer my fear of
public speaking. After much hemming
and hawing, I signed up for a workshop
at the Public Speaking–Social Anxiety
Center of New York. I had my doubts; I
felt like a garden-variety shy person,
and I didn’t like the pathological sound
of the term “social anxiety.” But the
class
was
based
on
desensitization
training, an approach that made sense
to me. Often used as a way to conquer
phobias, desensitization involves expos-
ing yourself (and your amygdala) to the
thing you’re afraid of over and over
again, in manageable doses. This is
367/929
very different from the well-meaning
but unhelpful advice that you should
just jump in at the deep end and try to
swim—an approach that might work,
but more likely will produce panic, fur-
ther encoding in your brain a cycle of
dread, fear, and shame.
I found myself in good company.
There were about fifteen people in the
class, which was led by Charles di
Cagno,
a
wiry,
compact
man
with
warm brown eyes and a sophisticated
sense of humor. Charles is himself a
veteran
of
exposure
therapy.
Public
speaking anxiety doesn’t keep him up
at night anymore, he says, but fear is a
wily enemy and he’s always working to
get the better of it.
The workshop had been in session for
a few weeks before I joined, but Charles
assured me that newcomers were wel-
come. The group was more diverse than
368/929
I expected. There was a fashion design-
er with long, curly hair, bright lipstick,
and pointy snakeskin boots; a secretary
with
thick
glasses
and
a
clipped,
matter-of-fact manner, who talked a lot
about her Mensa membership; a couple
of investment bankers, tall and athletic;
an actor with black hair and vivid blue
eyes who bounded cheerfully across the
room in his Puma sneakers but claimed
to be terrified the entire time; a Chinese
software designer with a sweet smile
and a nervous laugh. A regular cross-
section of New Yorkers, really. It might
have been a class in digital photo-
graphy or Italian cooking.
Except that it wasn’t. Charles ex-
plained that each of us would speak in
front of the group, but at an anxiety
level we could handle.
A
martial
arts
instructor
named
Lateesha was first up that evening.
369/929
Lateesha’s
assignment
was
to
read
aloud to the class from a Robert Frost
poem. With her dreadlocks and wide
smile, Lateesha looked as if she wasn’t
afraid of anything. But as she got ready
to speak, her book propped open at the
podium, Charles asked how anxious she
was, on a scale of 1 to 10.
“At least seven,” said Lateesha.
“Take it slow,” he said. “There are
only a few people out there who can
completely overcome their fears, and
they all live in Tibet.”
Lateesha read the poem clearly and
quietly, with only the slightest tremor
in her voice. When she was finished,
Charles beamed proudly.
“Stand up please, Lisa,” he said, ad-
dressing an attractive young marketing
director with shiny black hair and a
gleaming engagement ring. “It’s your
370/929
turn to offer feedback. Did Lateesha
look nervous?”
“No,” said Lisa.
“I was really scared, though,” Latee-
sha said.
“Don’t worry, no one could tell,” Lisa
assured her.
The others nodded their heads vigor-
ously. Couldn’t tell at all, they echoed.
Lateesha sat down, looking pleased.
Next it was my turn. I stood at a
makeshift
podium—really
a
music
stand—and faced the group. The only
sound in the room was the ticking of
the ceiling fan and the blare of traffic
outside. Charles asked me to introduce
myself. I took a deep breath.
“HELLOOO!!!!” I shouted, hoping to
sound dynamic.
Charles
looked
alarmed.
“Just
be
yourself,” he said.
371/929
My first exercise was simple. All I
had to do was answer a few questions
that people called out: Where do you
live? What do you do for a living?
What did you do this weekend?
I
answered
the
questions
in
my
normal, soft-spoken way. The group
listened carefully.
“Does anyone have any more ques-
tions for Susan?” asked Charles. The
group shook their heads.
“Now, Dan,” said Charles, nodding at
a
strapping
red-haired
fellow
who
looked like one of those CNBC journal-
ists reporting directly from the New
York Stock Exchange, “you’re a banker
and you have tough standards. Tell me,
did Susan look nervous?”
“Not at all,” said Dan.
The rest of the group nodded. Not
nervous at all, they murmured—just as
they had for Lateesha.
372/929
You seem so outgoing, they added.
You came across as really confident!
You’re lucky because you never run out
of things to say.
I sat down feeling pretty good about
myself. But soon I saw that Lateesha
and I weren’t the only ones to get that
kind of feedback. A few others did as
well.
“You
looked
so
calm!”
these
speakers were told, to their visible re-
lief. “No one would ever know if they
didn’t know! What are you doing in this
class?”
At first I wondered why I prized
these reassurances so highly. Then I
realized that I was attending the work-
shop because I wanted to stretch myself
to the outer limits of my temperament.
I wanted to be the best and bravest
speaker I could be. The reassurances
were evidence that I was on my way to-
ward achieving this goal. I suspected
373/929
that the feedback I was getting was
overly charitable, but I didn’t care.
What mattered was that I’d addressed
an audience that had received me well,
and I felt good about the experience. I
had begun to desensitize myself to the
horrors of public speaking.
Since then, I’ve done plenty of speak-
ing, to groups of ten and crowds of
hundreds. I’ve come to embrace the
power of the podium. For me this in-
volves taking specific steps, including
treating every speech as a creative pro-
ject, so that when I get ready for the
big day, I experience that delving-deep
sensation I enjoy so much. I also speak
on topics that matter to me deeply, and
have found that I feel much more
centered when I truly care about my
subject.
This isn’t always possible, of course.
Sometimes speakers need to talk about
374/929
subjects that don’t interest them much,
especially at work. I believe this is
harder for introverts, who have trouble
projecting
artificial
enthusiasm.
But
there’s a hidden advantage to this in-
flexibility: it can motivate us to make
tough but worthwhile career changes if
we find ourselves compelled to speak
too often about topics that leave us
cold. There is no one more courageous
than the person who speaks with the
courage of his convictions.

“FRANKLIN WAS A POLITICIAN, BUT
ELEANOR SPOKE OUT OF
CONSCIENCE”
Why Cool Is Overrated
A shy man no doubt dreads the notice of
strangers, but can hardly be said to be
afraid of them. He may be as bold as a
hero in battle, and yet have no self-con-
fidence about trifles in the presence of
strangers.
—CHARLES DARWIN
Easter Sunday, 1939. The Lincoln Me-
morial. Marian Anderson, one of the
most extraordinary singers of her gen-
eration, takes the stage, the statue of
the sixteenth president rising up behind
her. A regal woman with toffee-colored
skin, she gazes at her audience of
75,000: men in brimmed hats, ladies in
their Sunday best, a great sea of black
and white faces. “My country ’tis of
thee,” she begins, her voice soaring,
each word pure and distinct. “Sweet
land of liberty.” The crowd is rapt and
tearful. They never thought this day
would come to pass.
And it wouldn’t have, without Elean-
or Roosevelt. Earlier that year, Ander-
son had planned to sing at Constitution
Hall
in
Washington,
D.C.,
but
the
Daughters of the American Revolution,
who owned the hall, rejected her be-
cause of her race. Eleanor Roosevelt,
whose family had fought in the Revolu-
tion, resigned from the DAR, helped ar-
range for Anderson to sing at the Lin-
coln Memorial—and ignited a national
377/929
firestorm. Roosevelt was not the only
one to protest, but she brought political
clout to the issue, risking her own repu-
tation in the process.
For Roosevelt, who seemed constitu-
tionally unable to look away from other
people’s troubles, such acts of social
conscience were nothing unusual. But
others
appreciated
how
remarkable
they
were.
“This
was
something
unique,” recalled the African-American
civil rights leader James Farmer of
Roosevelt’s brave stand. “Franklin was
a politician. He weighed the political
consequences of every step that he
took. He was a good politician, too. But
Eleanor spoke out of conscience, and
acted as a conscientious person. That
was different.”
It was a role she played throughout
their life together: Franklin’s adviser,
Franklin’s conscience. He may have
378/929
chosen her for just this reason; in other
ways they were such an unlikely pair.
They
met
when
he
was
twenty.
Franklin
was
her
distant
cousin,
a
sheltered
Harvard
senior
from
an
upper-crust family. Eleanor was only
nineteen, also from a moneyed clan,
but she had chosen to immerse herself
in the sufferings of the poor, despite
her family’s disapproval. As a volunteer
at a settlement house on Manhattan’s
impoverished Lower East Side, she had
met children who were forced to sew
artificial flowers in windowless factor-
ies to the point of exhaustion. She took
Franklin with her one day. He couldn’t
believe that human beings lived in such
miserable conditions—or that a young
woman of his own class had been the
one to open his eyes to this side of
America. He promptly fell in love with
her.
379/929
But Eleanor wasn’t the light, witty
type he’d been expected to marry. Just
the opposite: she was slow to laugh,
bored by small talk, serious-minded,
shy. Her mother, a fine-boned, viva-
cious aristocrat, had nicknamed her
“Granny” because of her demeanor. Her
father,
the
charming
and
popular
younger brother of Theodore Roosevelt,
doted on her when he saw her, but he
was drunk most of the time, and died
when Eleanor was nine. By the time
Eleanor met Franklin, she couldn’t be-
lieve that someone like him would be
interested
in
her.
Franklin
was
everything that she was not: bold and
buoyant,
with
a
wide,
irrepressible
grin, as easy with people as she was
cautious. “He was young and gay and
good looking,” Eleanor recalled, “and I
was shy and awkward and thrilled
when he asked me to dance.”
380/929
At the same time, many told Eleanor
that Franklin wasn’t good enough for
her. Some saw him as a lightweight, a
mediocre
scholar,
a
frivolous
man-
about-town. And however poor Elean-
or’s own self-image, she did not lack for
admirers who appreciated her gravitas.
Some of her suitors wrote grudging let-
ters
of
congratulations
to
Franklin
when he won her hand. “I have more
respect and admiration for Eleanor than
any girl I have ever met,” one letter-
writer said. “You are mighty lucky.
Your future wife is such as it is the
privilege of few men to have,” said
another.
But public opinion was beside the
point for Franklin and Eleanor. Each
had
strengths
that
the
other
craved—her empathy, his bravado. “E
is an Angel,” Franklin wrote in his
journal.
When
she
accepted
his
381/929
marriage proposal in 1903, he pro-
claimed himself the happiest man alive.
She responded with a flood of love let-
ters. They were married in 1905 and
went on to have six children.
Despite the excitement of their court-
ship, their differences caused trouble
from the start. Eleanor craved intimacy
and weighty conversations; he loved
parties, flirting, and gossip. The man
who would declare that he had nothing
to fear but fear itself could not under-
stand his wife’s struggles with shyness.
When Franklin was appointed assistant
secretary of the navy in 1913, the pace
of his social life grew ever more fren-
zied and the settings more gilded—elite
private clubs, his Harvard friends’ man-
sions. He caroused later and later into
the night. Eleanor went home earlier
and earlier.
382/929
In the meantime, Eleanor found her-
self with a full calendar of social duties.
She was expected to pay visits to the
wives of other Washington luminaries,
leaving calling cards at their doors and
holding open houses in her own home.
She didn’t relish this role, so she hired
a social secretary named Lucy Mercer
to help her. Which seemed a good
idea—until the summer of 1917, when
Eleanor took the children to Maine for
the summer, leaving Franklin behind in
Washington
with
Mercer.
The
two
began a lifelong affair. Lucy was just
the kind of lively beauty Franklin had
been expected to marry in the first
place.
Eleanor found out about Franklin’s
betrayal when she stumbled on a pack-
et of love letters in his suitcase. She
was devastated, but stayed in the mar-
riage.
And
although
they
never
383/929
rekindled the romantic side of their re-
lationship, she and Franklin replaced it
with something formidable: a union of
his confidence with her conscience.
Fast-forward to our own time, where
we’ll meet another woman of similar
temperament, acting out of her own
sense of conscience. Dr. Elaine Aron is
a research psychologist who, since her
first scientific publication in 1997, has
singlehandedly reframed what Jerome
Kagan and others call high reactivity
(and sometimes “negativity” or “inhibi-
tion”). She calls it “sensitivity,” and
along with her new name for the trait,
she’s transformed and deepened our un-
derstanding of it.
384/929
When I hear that Aron will be the
keynote speaker at an annual weekend
gathering of “highly sensitive people”
at
Walker
Creek
Ranch
in
Marin
County, California, I quickly buy plane
tickets. Jacquelyn Strickland, a psycho-
therapist and the founder and host of
the event, explains that she created
these weekends so that sensitive people
could benefit from being in one anoth-
er’s presence. She sends me an agenda
explaining that we’ll be sleeping in
rooms designated for “napping, journal-
ing, puttering, meditating, organizing,
writing, and reflecting.”
“Please do socialize very quietly in
your room (with consent of your room-
mate), or preferably in the group areas
on walks and at mealtimes,” says the
agenda. The conference is geared to
people who enjoy meaningful discus-
sions
and
sometimes
“move
a
385/929
conversation to a deeper level, only to
find out we are the only ones there.”
There will be plenty of time for serious
talk this weekend, we’re assured. But
we’ll also be free to come and go as we
please. Strickland knows that most of
us will have weathered a lifetime of
mandatory group activities, and she
wants to show us a different model, if
only for a few days.
Walker Creek Ranch sits on 1,741
acres of unspoiled Northern California
wilderness. It offers hiking trails and
wildlife and vast crystalline skies, but
at its center is a cozy, barnlike confer-
ence center where about thirty of us
gather on a Thursday afternoon in the
middle of June. The Buckeye Lodge is
outfitted with grey industrial carpets,
large whiteboards, and picture win-
dows
overlooking
sunny
redwood
forests. Alongside the usual piles of
386/929
registration forms and name badges,
there’s a flip chart where we’re asked to
write our name and Myers-Briggs per-
sonality type. I scan the list. Everyone’s
an introvert except for Strickland, who
is warm, welcoming, and expressive.
(According to Aron’s research, the ma-
jority,
though
not
all,
of
sensitive
people are introverts.)
The tables and chairs in the room are
organized in a big square so that we
can all sit and face one another. Strick-
land invites us—participation option-
al—to share what brought us here. A
software engineer named Tom kicks off,
describing with great passion his relief
at learning that there was “a physiolo-
gical basis for the trait of sensitivity.
Here’s the research! This is how I am! I
don’t have to try to meet anyone’s ex-
pectations anymore. I don’t need to feel
apologetic or defensive in any way.”
387/929
With his long, narrow face, brown hair,
and matching beard, Tom reminds me
of Abraham Lincoln. He introduces his
wife, who talks about how compatible
she and Tom are, and how together
they stumbled across Aron’s work.
When it’s my turn, I talk about how
I’ve never been in a group environment
in which I didn’t feel obliged to present
an unnaturally rah-rah version of my-
self. I say that I’m interested in the con-
nection between introversion and sens-
itivity. Many people nod.
On Saturday morning, Dr. Aron ap-
pears in the Buckeye Lodge. She waits
playfully behind an easel containing a
flip chart while Strickland introduces
her to the audience. Then she emerges
smiling—ta-da!—from behind the easel,
sensibly clad in a blazer, turtleneck,
and
corduroy
skirt.
She
has
short,
feathery brown hair and warm, crinkly
388/929
blue eyes that look as if they don’t miss
a thing. You can see immediately the
dignified scholar Aron is today, as well
as the awkward schoolgirl she must
once have been. You can see, too, her
respect for her audience.
Getting right down to business, she
informs us that she has five different
subtopics she can discuss, and asks us
to raise our hands to vote for our first,
second, and third choice of subjects.
Then she performs, rapid-fire, an elab-
orate
mathematical
calculation
from
which she determines the three subtop-
ics for which we’ve collectively voted.
The crowd settles down amiably. It
doesn’t really matter which subtopics
we’ve chosen; we know that Aron is
here to talk about sensitivity, and that
she’s
taking
our
preferences
into
consideration.
389/929
Some psychologists make their mark
by doing unusual research experiments.
Aron’s contribution is to think differ-
ently, radically differently, about stud-
ies that others have done. When she
was a girl, Aron was often told that she
was “too sensitive for her own good.”
She had two hardy elder siblings and
was the only child in her family who
liked to daydream, and play inside, and
whose feelings were easily hurt. As she
grew older and ventured outside her
family’s orbit, she continued to notice
things about herself that seemed differ-
ent from the norm. She could drive
alone for hours and never turn on the
radio. She had strong, sometimes dis-
turbing
dreams
at
night.
She
was
“strangely intense,” and often beset by
powerful emotions, both positive and
negative. She had trouble finding the
sacred in the everyday; it seemed to be
390/929
there only when she withdrew from the
world.
Aron grew up, became a psycholo-
gist, and married a robust man who
loved these qualities. To her husband,
Art, Aron was creative, intuitive, and a
deep thinker. She appreciated these
things in herself, too, but saw them as
“acceptable surface manifestations of a
terrible, hidden flaw I had been aware
of all my life.” She thought it was a
miracle that Art loved her in spite of
this flaw.
But when one of her fellow psycholo-
gists casually described Aron as “highly
sensitive,” a lightbulb went on in her
head. It was as if these two words de-
scribed her mysterious failing, except
that the psychologist hadn’t been refer-
ring to a flaw at all. It had been a neut-
ral description.
391/929
Aron pondered this new insight, and
then set out to research this trait called
“sensitivity.” She came up mostly dry,
so she pored over the vast literature on
introversion, which seemed to be intim-
ately related: Kagan’s work on high-re-
active children, and the long line of ex-
periments on the tendency of introverts
to be more sensitive to social and sens-
ory stimulation. These studies gave her
glimpses of what she was looking for,
but Aron thought that there was a miss-
ing piece in the emerging portrait of in-
troverted people.
“The problem for scientists is that we
try to observe behavior, and these are
things that you cannot observe,” she ex-
plains. Scientists can easily report on
the behavior of extroverts, who can of-
ten be found laughing, talking, or ges-
ticulating. But “if a person is standing
in the corner of a room, you can
392/929
attribute about fifteen motivations to
that person. But you don’t really know
what’s going on inside.”
Yet inner behavior was still behavior,
thought Aron, even if it was difficult to
catalog. So what is the inner behavior
of people whose most visible feature is
that when you take them to a party
they aren’t very pleased about it? She
decided to find out.
First
Aron
interviewed
thirty-nine
people who described themselves as be-
ing either introverted or easily over-
whelmed
by
stimulation.
She
asked
them about the movies they liked, their
first memories, relationships with par-
ents, friendships, love lives, creative
activities, philosophical and religious
views. Based on these interviews, she
created
a
voluminous
questionnaire
that she gave to several large groups of
people. Then she boiled their responses
393/929
down to a constellation of twenty-seven
attributes. She named the people who
embodied
these
attributes
“highly
sensitive.”
Some of these twenty-seven attrib-
utes were familiar from Kagan and oth-
ers’ work. For example, highly sensitive
people tend to be keen observers who
look before they leap. They arrange
their lives in ways that limit surprises.
They’re
often
sensitive
to
sights,
sounds, smells, pain, coffee. They have
difficulty
when
being
observed
(at
work, say, or performing at a music re-
cital) or judged for general worthiness
(dating, job interviews).
But there were also new insights. The
highly sensitive tend to be philosophic-
al
or
spiritual
in
their
orientation,
rather than materialistic or hedonistic.
They dislike small talk. They often de-
scribe
themselves
as
creative
or
394/929
intuitive (just as Aron’s husband had
described her). They dream vividly, and
can often recall their dreams the next
day. They love music, nature, art, phys-
ical
beauty.
They
feel
exceptionally
strong
emotions—sometimes
acute
bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melan-
choly, and fear.
Highly sensitive people also process
information
about
their
environ-
ments—both
physical
and
emotion-
al—unusually deeply. They tend to no-
tice subtleties that others miss—anoth-
er person’s shift in mood, say, or a
lightbulb burning a touch too brightly.
Recently
a
group
of
scientists
at
Stony Brook University tested this find-
ing by showing two pairs of photos (of
a fence and some bales of hay) to eight-
een people lying inside fMRI machines.
In one pair the photos were noticeably
different from each other, and in the
395/929
other pair the difference was much
more subtle. For each pair, the scient-
ists asked whether the second photo
was the same as the first. They found
that sensitive people spent more time
than others looking at the photos with
the subtle differences. Their brains also
showed more activity in regions that
help
to
make
associations
between
those images and other stored informa-
tion.
In
other
words,
the
sensitive
people were processing the photos at a
more elaborate level than their peers,
reflecting more on those fenceposts and
haystacks.
This study is very new, and its con-
clusions still need to be replicated and
explored
in
other
contexts.
But
it
echoes Jerome Kagan’s findings that
high-reactive first graders spend more
time than other children comparing
choices
when
they
play
matching
396/929
games or reading unfamiliar words.
And it suggests, says Jadzia Jagiellow-
icz, the lead scientist at Stony Brook,
that sensitive types think in an unusu-
ally complex fashion. It may also help
explain why they’re so bored by small
talk. “If you’re thinking in more com-
plicated ways,” she told me, “then talk-
ing about the weather or where you
went for the holidays is not quite as in-
teresting as talking about values or
morality.”
The other thing Aron found about
sensitive
people
is
that
sometimes
they’re highly empathic. It’s as if they
have
thinner
boundaries
separating
them from other people’s emotions and
from the tragedies and cruelties of the
world. They tend to have unusually
strong consciences. They avoid violent
movies and TV shows; they’re acutely
aware of the consequences of a lapse in
397/929
their own behavior. In social settings
they often focus on subjects like person-
al problems, which others consider “too
heavy.”
Aron realized that she was on to
something big. Many of the character-
istics of sensitive people that she’d
identified—such as empathy and re-
sponsiveness to beauty—were believed
by psychologists to be characteristic of
other personality traits like “agreeable-
ness” and “openness to experience.” But
Aron saw that they were also a funda-
mental part of sensitivity. Her findings
implicitly challenged accepted tenets of
personality psychology.
She started publishing her results in
academic
journals
and
books,
and
speaking publicly about her work. At
first this was difficult. Audience mem-
bers told her that her ideas were fascin-
ating, but that her uncertain delivery
398/929
was distracting. But Aron had a great
desire to get her message out. She per-
severed, and learned to speak like the
authority she was. By the time I saw
her at Walker Creek Ranch, she was
practiced, crisp, and sure. The only dif-
ference between her and your typical
speaker
was
how
conscientious
she
seemed
about
answering
every
last
audience question. She lingered after-
ward with the group, even though, as
an extreme introvert, she must have
been itching to get home.
Aron’s description of highly sensitive
people sounds as if she’s talking about
Eleanor Roosevelt herself. Indeed, in
the years since Aron first published her
findings,
scientists
have
found
that
when you put people whose genetic
profiles have been tentatively associ-
ated with sensitivity and introversion
(people
with
the
gene
variant
of
399/929
5-HTTLPR that characterized the rhesus
monkeys of chapter 3) inside an fMRI
machine and show them pictures of
scared faces, accident victims, mutil-
ated bodies, and polluted scenery, the
amygdala—the part of the brain that
plays such an important role in pro-
cessing emotions—becomes strongly ac-
tivated. Aron and a team of scientists
have also found that when sensitive
people see faces of people experiencing
strong feelings, they have more activa-
tion than others do in areas of the brain
associated with empathy and with try-
ing to control strong emotions.
It’s as if, like Eleanor Roosevelt, they
can’t help but feel what others feel.
400/929
In 1921, FDR contracted polio. It was a
terrible blow, and he considered retir-
ing to the country to live out his life as
an invalid gentleman. But Eleanor kept
his contacts with the Democratic Party
alive while he recovered, even agreeing
to address a party fund-raiser. She was
terrified of public speaking, and not
much good at it—she had a high-
pitched voice and laughed nervously at
all the wrong times. But she trained for
the event and made her way through
the speech.
After that, Eleanor was still unsure of
herself, but she began working to fix
the social problems she saw all around
her. She became a champion of wo-
men’s issues and forged alliances with
other serious-minded people. By 1928,
when FDR was elected governor of New
York, she was the director of the Bur-
eau
of
Women’s
Activities
for
the
401/929
Democratic Party and one of the most
influential women in American politics.
She and Franklin were now a fully
functioning partnership of his savoir
faire and her social conscience. “I knew
about social conditions, perhaps more
than he did,” Eleanor recalled with
characteristic modesty. “But he knew
about government and how you could
use government to improve things. And
I think we began to get an understand-
ing of teamwork.”
FDR was elected president in 1933. It
was the height of the Depression, and
Eleanor
traveled
the
country—in
a
single three-month period she covered
40,000
miles—listening
to
ordinary
people
tell
their
hard-luck
stories.
People opened up to her in ways they
didn’t for other powerful figures. She
became for Franklin the voice of the
dispossessed. When she returned home
402/929
from her trips, she often told him what
she’d seen and pressed him to act. She
helped
orchestrate
government
pro-
grams for half-starved miners in Ap-
palachia. She urged FDR to include wo-
men and African-Americans in his pro-
grams to put people back to work. And
she helped arrange for Marian Ander-
son to sing at the Lincoln Memorial.
“She kept at him on issues which he
might, in the rush of things, have
wanted
to
overlook,”
the
historian
Geoff Ward has said. “She kept him to a
high standard. Anyone who ever saw
her lock eyes with him and say, ‘Now
Franklin, you should …’ never forgot it.”
The shy young woman who’d been
terrified of public speaking grew to
love public life. Eleanor Roosevelt be-
came the first First Lady to hold a press
conference, address a national conven-
tion, write a newspaper column, and
403/929
appear on talk radio. Later in her career
she served as a U.S. delegate to the Un-
ited Nations, where she used her unusu-
al brand of political skills and hard-won
toughness to help win passage of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
She never did outgrow her vulnerab-
ility; all her life she suffered dark
“Griselda moods,” as she called them
(named for a princess in a medieval le-
gend who withdrew into silence), and
struggled to “develop skin as tough as
rhinoceros hide.” “I think people who
are shy remain shy always, but they
learn how to overcome it,” she said.
But it was perhaps this sensitivity that
made it easy for her to relate to the dis-
enfranchised, and conscientious enough
to act on their behalf. FDR, elected at
the
start
of
the
Depression,
is
re-
membered for his compassion. But it
404/929
was Eleanor who made sure he knew
how suffering Americans felt.
The connection between sensitivity and
conscience
has
long
been
observed.
Imagine the following experiment, per-
formed by the developmental psycholo-
gist Grazyna Kochanska. A kind woman
hands a toy to a toddler, explaining
that the child should be very careful be-
cause it’s one of the woman’s favorites.
The child solemnly nods assent and be-
gins to play with the toy. Soon after-
ward, it breaks dramatically in two,
having been rigged to do so.
The woman looks upset and cries,
“Oh my!” Then she waits to see what
the child does next.
405/929
Some children, it turns out, feel a lot
more
guilty
about
their
(supposed)
transgression than others. They look
away, hug themselves, stammer out
confessions, hide their faces. And it’s
the kids we might call the most sensit-
ive, the most high-reactive, the ones
who are likely to be introverts who feel
the guiltiest. Being unusually sensitive
to all experience, both positive and
negative, they seem to feel both the
sorrow of the woman whose toy is
broken and the anxiety of having done
something bad. (In case you’re wonder-
ing, the woman in the experiments
quickly returned to the room with the
toy “fixed” and reassurances that the
child had done nothing wrong.)
In our culture, guilt is a tainted word,
but it’s probably one of the building
blocks of conscience. The anxiety these
highly
sensitive
toddlers
feel
upon
406/929
apparently breaking the toy gives them
the
motivation
to
avoid
harming
someone’s plaything the next time. By
age four, according to Kochanska, these
same kids are less likely than their
peers to cheat or break rules, even when
they think they can’t be caught. And by
six or seven, they’re more likely to be
described by their parents as having
high levels of moral traits such as em-
pathy. They also have fewer behavioral
problems in general.
“Functional, moderate guilt,” writes
Kochanska, “may promote future altru-
ism, personal responsibility, adaptive
behavior in school, and harmonious,
competent, and prosocial relationships
with parents, teachers, and friends.”
This is an especially important set of at-
tributes
at
a
time
when
a
2010
University of Michigan study shows
that
college
students
today
are
40
407/929
percent less empathetic than they were
thirty years ago, with much of the drop
having
occurred
since
2000.
(The
study’s authors speculate that the de-
cline in empathy is related to the pre-
valence of social media, reality TV, and
“hyper-competitiveness.”)
Of course, having these traits doesn’t
mean that sensitive children are angels.
They have selfish streaks like everyone
else. Sometimes they act aloof and un-
friendly.
And
when
they’re
over-
whelmed
by
negative
emotions
like
shame or anxiety, says Aron, they can
be positively oblivious of other people’s
needs.
But the same receptivity to experi-
ence that can make life difficult for the
highly sensitive also builds their con-
sciences. Aron tells of one sensitive
teen who persuaded his mother to feed
a homeless person he’d met in the park,
408/929
and of another eight-year-old who cried
not only when she felt embarrassed, but
also when her peers were teased.
We know this type of person well
from literature, probably because so
many writers are sensitive introverts
themselves. He “had gone through life
with one skin fewer than most men,”
the novelist Eric Malpass writes of his
quiet and cerebral protagonist, also an
author, in the novel The Long Long
Dances. “The troubles of others moved
him more, as did also the teeming
beauty of life: moved him, compelled
him, to seize a pen and write about
them. [He was moved by] walking in
the hills, listening to a Schubert im-
promptu, watching nightly from his
armchair the smashing of bone and
flesh that made up so much of the nine
o’clock news.”
409/929
The description of such characters as
thin-skinned is meant metaphorically,
but it turns out that it’s actually quite
literal. Among the tests researchers use
to measure personality traits are skin
conductance tests, which record how
much
people
sweat
in
response
to
noises,
strong
emotions,
and
other
stimuli. High-reactive introverts sweat
more;
low-reactive
extroverts
sweat
less. Their skin is literally “thicker,”
more impervious to stimuli, cooler to
the touch. In fact, according to some of
the scientists I spoke to, this is where
our
notion
of
being
socially
“cool”
comes from; the lower-reactive you are,
the cooler your skin, the cooler you are.
(Incidentally, sociopaths lie at the ex-
treme end of this coolness barometer,
with extremely low levels of arousal,
skin conductance, and anxiety. There is
410/929
some evidence that sociopaths have
damaged amygdalae.)
Lie detectors (polygraphs) are par-
tially skin conductance tests. They op-
erate on the theory that lying causes
anxiety, which triggers the skin to per-
spire imperceptibly. When I was in col-
lege, I applied for a summer job as a
secretary at a large jewelry company. I
had to take a lie detector test as part of
the application process. The test was
administered
in a small, dingily
lit
room with linoleum floors, by a thin,
cigarette-puffing man with pocked yel-
low skin. The man asked me a series of
warm-up questions: my name, address,
and so on, to establish my baseline
level of skin conductance. Then the
questions grew more probing and the
examiner’s manner harsher. Had I been
arrested? Had I ever shoplifted? Had I
used cocaine? With this last question
411/929
my interrogator peered at me intently.
As it happens, I never had tried cocaine.
But he seemed to think I had. The ac-
cusing look on his face was the equival-
ent of the old policeman’s trick where
they tell the suspect that they have the
damning evidence and there’s no point
denying it.
I knew the man was mistaken, but I
still felt myself blush. And sure enough,
the test came back showing I’d lied on
the cocaine question. My skin is so thin,
apparently, that it sweats in response to
imaginary crimes!
We tend to think of coolness as a
pose that you strike with a pair of
sunglasses, a nonchalant attitude, and
drink in hand. But maybe we didn’t
choose these social accessories at ran-
dom.
Maybe
we’ve
adopted
dark
glasses, relaxed body language, and al-
cohol as signifiers precisely because
412/929
they camouflage signs of a nervous sys-
tem on overdrive. Sunglasses prevent
others from seeing our eyes dilate with
surprise or fear; we know from Kagan’s
work that a relaxed torso is a hallmark
of low reactivity; and alcohol removes
our inhibitions and lowers our arousal
levels. When you go to a football game
and someone offers you a beer, says the
personality
psychologist
Brian
Little,
“they’re really saying hi, have a glass of
extroversion.”
Teenagers
understand
instinctively
the physiology of cool. In Curtis Sitten-
feld’s novel Prep, which explores the
adolescent social rituals of boarding-
school life with uncanny precision, the
protagonist, Lee, is invited unexpec-
tedly to the dorm room of Aspeth, the
coolest girl in school. The first thing
she notices is how physically stimulat-
ing Aspeth’s world is. “From outside the
413/929
door, I could hear pounding music,”
she observes. “White Christmas lights,
currently turned on, were taped high
up along all the walls, and on the north
wall they’d hung an enormous orange
and green tapestry.… I felt overstimu-
lated and vaguely irritated. The room I
shared with [my roommate] seemed so
quiet and plain, our lives seemed so
quiet and plain. Had Aspeth been born
cool,
I
wondered,
or
had
someone
taught her, like an older sister or a
cousin?”
Jock cultures sense the low-reactive
physiology of cool, too. For the early
U.S. astronauts, having a low heart
rate, which is associated with low re-
activity, was a status symbol. Lieuten-
ant Colonel John Glenn, who became
the first American to orbit the Earth
and would later run for president, was
admired
by
his
comrades
for
his
414/929
supercool pulse rate during liftoff (only
110 beats per minute).
But physical lack of cool may be more
socially valuable than we think. That
deep blush when a hard-bitten tester
puts his face an inch from yours and
asks if you’ve ever used cocaine turns
out to be a kind of social glue. In a re-
cent experiment, a team of psycholo-
gists led by Corine Dijk asked sixty-odd
participants to read accounts of people
who’d done something morally wrong,
like driving away from a car crash, or
something embarrassing, like spilling
coffee on someone. The participants
were shown photographs of the wrong-
doers, who had one of four different fa-
cial
expressions:
shame
or
415/929
embarrassment (head and eyes down);
shame/embarrassment
plus
a
blush;
neutral; or neutral with a blush. Then
they were asked to rate how sympathet-
ic and trustworthy the transgressors
were.
It turned out that the offenders who
blushed were judged a lot more posit-
ively than those who didn’t. This was
because the blush signified concern for
others. As Dacher Keltner, a psycholo-
gist at the University of California,
Berkeley, who specializes in positive
emotions, put it to the New York Times,
“A blush comes online in two or three
seconds and says, ‘I care; I know I viol-
ated the social contract.’ ”
In fact, the very thing that many
high-reactives hate most about blush-
ing—its
uncontrollability—is
what
makes it so socially useful. “Because it
is
impossible
to
control
the
blush
416/929
intentionally,” Dijk speculates, blushing
is an authentic sign of embarrassment.
And embarrassment, according to Kelt-
ner, is a moral emotion. It shows humil-
ity, modesty, and a desire to avoid ag-
gression and make peace. It’s not about
isolating the person who feels ashamed
(which is how it sometimes feels to
easy
blushers),
but
about
bringing
people together.
Keltner has tracked the roots of hu-
man embarrassment and found that
after many primates fight, they try to
make up. They do this partly by making
gestures of embarrassment of the kind
we
see
in
humans—looking
away,
which acknowledges wrongdoing and
the
intention
to
stop;
lowering
the
head, which shrinks one’s size; and
pressing the lips together, a sign of in-
hibition.
These
gestures
in
humans
have been called “acts of devotion,”
417/929
writes Keltner. Indeed, Keltner, who is
trained in reading people’s faces, has
studied photos of moral heroes like
Gandhi and the Dalai Lama and found
that they feature just such controlled
smiles and averted eyes.
In his book, Born to Be Good, Keltner
even says that if he had to choose his
mate by asking a single question at a
speed-dating
event,
the
question
he
would choose is: “What was your last
embarrassing
experience?”
Then
he
would watch very carefully for lip-
presses, blushing, and averted eyes.
“The elements of the embarrassment
are fleeting statements the individual
makes about his or her respect for the
judgment of others,” he writes. “Embar-
rassment reveals how much the indi-
vidual cares about the rules that bind
us to one another.”
418/929
In other words, you want to make
sure that your spouse cares what other
people think. It’s better to mind too
much than to mind too little.
No matter how great the benefits of
blushing, the phenomenon of high sens-
itivity raises an obvious question. How
did the highly sensitive manage to sur-
vive the harsh sorting-out process of
evolution? If the bold and aggressive
generally
prevail
(as
it
sometimes
seems), why were the sensitive not se-
lected out of the human population
thousands of years ago, like tree frogs
colored orange? For you may, like the
protagonist of The Long Long Dances, be
moved more deeply than the next per-
son
by
the
opening
chords
of
a
419/929
Schubert
impromptu,
and
you
may
flinch more than others at the smashing
of bone and flesh, and you may have
been the sort of child who squirmed
horribly
when
you
thought
you’d
broken someone’s toy, but evolution
doesn’t reward such things.
Or does it?
Elaine Aron has an idea about this.
She believes that high sensitivity was
not itself selected for, but rather the
careful, reflective style that tends to ac-
company it. “The type that is ‘sensitive’
or ‘reactive’ would reflect a strategy of
observing carefully before acting,” she
writes, “thus avoiding dangers, failures,
and wasted energy, which would re-
quire a nervous system specially de-
signed to observe and detect subtle dif-
ferences. It is a strategy of ‘betting on a
sure thing’ or ‘looking before you leap.’
In contrast, the active strategy of the
420/929
[other type] is to be first, without com-
plete information and with the attend-
ant risks—the strategy of ‘taking a long
shot’ because the ‘early bird catches the
worm’ and ‘opportunity only knocks
once.’ ”
In truth, many people Aron considers
sensitive have some of the twenty-seven
attributes associated with the trait, but
not all of them. Maybe they’re sensitive
to light and noise, but not to coffee or
pain; maybe they’re not sensitive to
anything
sensory,
but
they’re
deep
thinkers with a rich inner life. Maybe
they’re not even introverts—only 70
percent of sensitive people are, accord-
ing to Aron, while the other 30 percent
are
extroverts
(although
this
group
tends to report craving more downtime
and solitude than your typical extro-
vert). This, speculates Aron, is because
sensitivity arose as a by-product of
421/929
survival strategy, and you need only
some, not all, of the traits to pull off
the strategy effectively.
There’s a great deal of evidence for
Aron’s point of view. Evolutionary bio-
logists once believed that every animal
species evolved to fit an ecological
niche, that there was one ideal set of
behaviors for that niche, and that spe-
cies members whose behavior deviated
from that ideal would die off. But it
turns out that it’s not only humans that
divide into those who “watch and wait”
and others who “just do it.” More than a
hundred species in the animal kingdom
are organized in roughly this way.
From fruit flies to house cats to
mountain goats, from sunfish to bush-
baby primates to Eurasian tit birds, sci-
entists have discovered that approxim-
ately 20 percent of the members of
many species are “slow to warm up,”
422/929
while the other 80 percent are “fast”
types who venture forth boldly without
noticing
much
of
what’s
going
on
around them. (Intriguingly, the percent-
age of infants in Kagan’s lab who were
born high-reactive was also, you’ll re-
call, about twenty.)
If
“fast”
and
“slow”
animals
had
parties, writes the evolutionary biolo-
gist David Sloan Wilson, “some of the
fasts would bore everyone with their
loud conversation, while others would
mutter into their beer that they don’t
get any respect. Slow animals are best
described as shy, sensitive types. They
don’t assert themselves, but they are
observant and notice things that are in-
visible to the bullies. They are the
writers and artists at the party who
have interesting conversations out of
earshot of the bullies. They are the in-
ventors who figure out new ways to
423/929
behave, while the bullies steal their
patents by copying their behavior.”
Once in a while, a newspaper or TV
program runs a story about animal per-
sonalities, casting shy behavior as un-
seemly and bold behavior as attractive
and admirable. (That’s our kind of fruit
fly!) But Wilson, like Aron, believes that
both types of animals exist because
they have radically different survival
strategies, each of which pays off differ-
ently and at different times. This is
what’s known as the trade-off theory of
evolution, in which a particular trait is
neither all good nor all bad, but a mix
of pros and cons whose survival value
varies according to circumstance.
“Shy” animals forage less often and
widely
for
food,
conserving
energy,
sticking to the sidelines, and surviving
when predators come calling. Bolder
animals sally forth, swallowed regularly
424/929
by those farther up the food chain but
surviving when food is scarce and they
need to assume more risk. When Wilson
dropped metal traps into a pond full of
pumpkinseed fish, an event he says
must have seemed to the fish as unset-
tling as a flying saucer landing on
Earth, the bold fish couldn’t help but
investigate—and rushed headlong into
Wilson’s traps. The shy fish hovered ju-
diciously at the edge of the pond, mak-
ing it impossible for Wilson to catch
them.
On the other hand, after Wilson suc-
ceeded in trapping both types of fish
with an elaborate netting system and
carrying them back to his lab, the bold
fish acclimated quickly to their new en-
vironment and started eating a full five
days earlier than did their shy brethren.
“There is no single best … [animal]
personality,” writes Wilson, “but rather
425/929
a diversity of personalities maintained
by natural selection.”
Another example of the trade-off the-
ory of evolution is a species known as
Trinidadian guppies. These guppies de-
velop
personalities—with
astonishing
speed, in evolutionary terms—to suit
the microclimates in which they live.
Their natural predators are pike. But
some guppy neighborhoods, upstream
of a waterfall for example, are pike-
free. If you’re a guppy who grew up in
such a charmed locale, then chances
are you have a bold and carefree per-
sonality well suited to la dolce vita. In
contrast, if your guppy family came
from
a
“bad
neighborhood”
down-
stream from the waterfall, where pike
cruise the waterways menacingly, then
you probably have a much more cir-
cumspect style, just right for avoiding
the bad guys.
426/929
The interesting thing is that these dif-
ferences are heritable, not learned, so
that the offspring of bold guppies who
move into bad neighborhoods inherit
their parents’ boldness—even though
this puts them at a severe disadvantage
compared to their vigilant peers. It
doesn’t take long for their genes to
mutate, though, and descendants who
manage to survive tend to be careful
types. The same thing happens to vigil-
ant guppies when the pike suddenly
disappear; it takes about twenty years
for their descendants to evolve into fish
who act as if they haven’t a care in the
world.
The trade-off theory seems to apply
equally
to
humans.
Scientists
have
427/929
found that nomads who inherited the
form of a particular gene linked to ex-
troversion (specifically, to novelty-seek-
ing) are better nourished than those
without this version of the gene. But in
settled populations, people with this
same gene form have poorer nutrition.
The same traits that make a nomad
fierce enough to hunt and to defend
livestock against raiders may hinder
more sedentary activities like farming,
selling goods at the market, or focusing
at school.
Or consider this trade-off: human ex-
troverts have more sex partners than in-
troverts do—a boon to any species
wanting to reproduce itself—but they
commit
more
adultery
and
divorce
more frequently, which is not a good
thing for the children of all those coup-
lings. Extroverts exercise more, but in-
troverts
suffer
fewer
accidents
and
428/929
traumatic
injuries.
Extroverts
enjoy
wider networks of social support, but
commit more crimes. As Jung specu-
lated almost a century ago about the
two types, “the one [extroversion] con-
sists in a high rate of fertility, with low
powers of defense and short duration of
life for the single individual; the other
[introversion] consists in equipping the
individual
with
numerous
means
of
self-preservation
plus a low fertility
rate.”
The trade-off theory may even apply
to entire species. Among evolutionary
biologists, who tend to subscribe to the
vision of lone individuals hell-bent on
reproducing their own DNA, the idea
that species include individuals whose
traits promote group survival is hotly
debated and, not long ago, could prac-
tically
get
you
kicked
out
of
the
academy.
But
this
view
is
slowly
429/929
gaining
acceptance.
Some
scientists
even speculate that the evolutionary
basis
for
traits
like
sensitivity
is
heightened compassion for the suffer-
ing of other members of one’s species,
especially one’s family.
But you don’t have to go that far. As
Aron explains, it makes sense that an-
imal groups depend on their sensitive
members for survival. “Suppose a herd
of antelope … has a few members who
are constantly stopping their grazing to
use their keen senses to watch for pred-
ators,” she writes. “Herds with such
sensitive, watchful individuals would
survive
better,
and
so
continue
to
breed, and so continue to have some
sensitive
individuals
born
in
the
group.”
And why should it be any different
for
humans?
We
need
our
Eleanor
430/929
Roosevelts as surely as grazing herds
depend on their sensitive antelopes.
In addition to “shy” and “bold” anim-
als, and to “fast” and “slow” ones, bio-
logists sometimes speak of the “hawk”
and “dove” members of a given species.
Great tit birds, for example, some of
whom are much more aggressive than
others, often act like case studies in an
international
relations
class.
These
birds feed on beech tree nuts, and in
years when nuts are scarce, the hawk-
ish female birds do better, just as you’d
expect,
because
they’re
quick
to
challenge nut-eating competitors to a
duel. But in seasons when there are
plenty of beech nuts to go around, the
female
“doves”—who,
incidentally,
tend to make more attentive moth-
ers—do better than the “hawks,” be-
cause the hawks waste time and bodily
431/929
health getting into fights for no good
reason.
Male great tits, on the other hand,
have the opposite pattern. This is be-
cause their main role in life is not to
find food but to defend territory. In
years when food is scarce, so many of
their fellow tit birds die of hunger that
there’s enough space for all. The hawk-
ish males then fall into the same trap as
their female comrades during nutty sea-
sons—they brawl, squandering precious
resources with each bloody battle. But
in good years, when competition for
nesting territory heats up, aggression
pays for the hawkish male tit bird.
During times of war or fear—the hu-
man equivalent of a bad nut season for
432/929
female tit birds—it might seem that
what we need most are aggressive hero-
ic types. But if our entire population
consisted of warriors, there would be
no one to notice, let alone battle, po-
tentially deadly but far quieter threats
like viral disease or climate change.
Consider Vice President Al Gore’s
decades-long crusade to raise aware-
ness of global warming. Gore is, by
many accounts, an introvert. “If you
send an introvert into a reception or an
event with a hundred other people he
will emerge with less energy than he
had going in,” says a former aide.
“Gore needs a rest after an event.” Gore
acknowledges that his skills are not
conducive to stumping and speechmak-
ing. “Most people in politics draw en-
ergy from backslapping and shaking
hands and all that,” he has said. “I
draw energy from discussing ideas.”
433/929
But combine that passion for thought
with attention to subtlety—both com-
mon characteristics of introverts—and
you get a very powerful mix. In 1968,
when Gore was a college student at
Harvard, he took a class with an influ-
ential
oceanographer
who
presented
early evidence linking the burning of
fossil fuels with the greenhouse effect.
Gore’s ears perked up.
He tried to tell others what he knew.
But
he
found
that
people
wouldn’t
listen. It was as if they couldn’t hear
the alarm bells that rang so loudly in
his ears.
“When I went to Congress in the
middle of the 1970s, I helped organize
the first hearings on global warming,”
he recalls in the Oscar-winning movie
An Inconvenient Truth—a film whose
most stirring action scenes involve the
solitary figure of Gore wheeling his
434/929
suitcase through a midnight airport.
Gore seems genuinely puzzled that no
one paid attention: “I actually thought
and believed that the story would be
compelling enough to cause a real sea
change in the way Congress reacted to
that issue. I thought they would be
startled, too. And they weren’t.”
But if Gore had known then what we
know now about Kagan’s research, and
Aron’s, he might have been less sur-
prised by his colleagues’ reactions. He
might even have used his insight into
personality psychology to get them to
listen. Congress, he could have safely
assumed, is made up of some of the
least
sensitive
people
in
the
coun-
try—people who, if they’d been kids in
one
of
Kagan’s
experiments,
would
have
marched
up
to
oddly
attired
clowns and strange ladies wearing gas
masks without so much as a backward
435/929
glance
at
their
mothers.
Remember
Kagan’s introverted Tom and extrover-
ted Ralph? Well, Congress is full of
Ralphs—it was designed for people like
Ralph. Most of the Toms of the world
do not want to spend their days plan-
ning campaigns and schmoozing with
lobbyists.
These Ralph-like Congressmen can be
wonderful people—exuberant, fearless,
persuasive—but they’re unlikely to feel
alarmed by a photograph of a tiny
crack in a distant glacier. They need
more intense stimulation to get them to
listen. Which is why Gore finally got
his message across when he teamed up
with whiz-bang Hollywood types who
could package his warning into the
special-effects-laden show that became
An Inconvenient Truth.
Gore also drew on his own strengths,
using his natural focus and diligence to
436/929
tirelessly promote the movie. He visited
dozens of movie theaters across the
country to meet with viewers, and gave
innumerable TV and radio interviews.
On the subject of global warming, Gore
has a clarity of voice that eluded him as
a politician. For Gore, immersing him-
self in a complicated scientific puzzle
comes naturally. Focusing on a single
passion rather than tap dancing from
subject to subject comes naturally. Even
talking to crowds comes naturally when
the topic is climate change: Gore on
global warming has an easy charisma
and connection with audience members
that eluded him as a political candid-
ate. That’s because this mission, for
him, is not about politics or personality.
It’s about the call of his conscience.
“It’s about the survival of the planet,”
he says. “Nobody is going to care who
437/929
won or lost any election when the earth
is uninhabitable.”
If you’re a sensitive sort, then you
may be in the habit of pretending to be
more of a politician and less cautious or
single-mindedly focused than you actu-
ally are. But in this chapter I’m asking
you
to
rethink
this
view.
Without
people like you, we will, quite literally,
drown.
Back here at Walker Creek Ranch and
the gathering for sensitive people, the
Extrovert Ideal and its primacy of cool
is turned upside down. If “cool” is low
reactivity that predisposes a person to
boldness
or
nonchalance,
then
the
crowd that has come to meet Elaine
Aron is deeply uncool.
438/929
The atmosphere is startling simply
because it’s so unusual. It’s something
you might find at a yoga class or in a
Buddhist monastery, except that here
there’s no unifying religion or world-
view, only a shared temperament. It’s
easy to see this when Aron delivers her
speech. She has long observed that
when she speaks to groups of highly
sensitive
people
the
room
is
more
hushed and respectful than would be
usual in a public gathering place, and
this is true throughout her presentation.
But it carries over all weekend.
I’ve
never
heard
so
many
“after
you’s” and “thank you’s” as I do here.
During meals, which are held at long
communal tables in a summer-camp
style, open-air cafeteria, people plunge
hungrily into searching conversations.
There’s a lot of one-on-one discussion
about intimate topics like childhood
439/929
experiences and adult love lives, and
social issues like health care and cli-
mate change; there’s not much in the
way of storytelling intended to enter-
tain. People listen carefully to each oth-
er and respond thoughtfully; Aron has
noted that sensitive people tend to
speak softly because that’s how they
prefer
others
to
communicate
with
them.
“In the rest of the world,” observes
Michelle, a web designer who leans for-
ward as if bracing herself against an
imaginary blast of wind, “you make a
statement and people may or may not
discuss it. Here you make a statement
and someone says, ‘What does that
mean?’ And if you ask that question of
someone else, they actually answer.”
It’s not that there’s no small talk, ob-
serves Strickland, the leader of the
gathering. It’s that it comes not at the
440/929
beginning of conversations but at the
end. In most settings, people use small
talk as a way of relaxing into a new re-
lationship, and only once they’re com-
fortable do they connect more seri-
ously. Sensitive people seem to do the
reverse. They “enjoy small talk only
after they’ve gone deep,” says Strick-
land. “When sensitive people are in en-
vironments that nurture their authenti-
city, they laugh and chitchat just as
much as anyone else.”
On the first night we drift to our bed-
rooms, housed in a dormlike building. I
brace myself instinctively: now’s the
time when I’ll want to read or sleep,
but will instead be called upon to have
a pillow fight (summer camp) or play a
loud
and
boring
drinking
game
(college). But at Walker Creek Ranch,
my roommate, a twenty-seven-year-old
secretary with huge, doe-like eyes and
441/929
the ambition to become an author, is
happy to spend the evening writing
peacefully in her journal. I do the same.
Of course, the weekend is not com-
pletely without tension. Some people
are reserved to the point of appearing
sullen.
Sometimes
the
do-your-own-
thing policy threatens to devolve into
mutual
loneliness
as
everyone
goes
their own separate ways. In fact, there
is such a deficit of the social behavior
we call “cool” that I begin thinking
someone should be cracking jokes, stir-
ring things up, handing out rum-and-
Cokes. Shouldn’t they?
The truth is, as much as I crave
breathing room for sensitive types, I
enjoy
hail-fellows-well-met,
too.
I’m
glad for the “cool” among us, and I
miss them this weekend. I’m starting to
speak so softly that I feel like I’m
442/929
putting myself to sleep. I wonder if
deep down the others feel this way, too.
Tom,
the
software
engineer
and
Abraham Lincoln look-alike, tells me of
a former girlfriend who was always
throwing open the doors of her house
to friends and strangers. She was ad-
venturous in every way: she loved new
food,
new
sexual
experiences,
new
people. It didn’t work out between
them—Tom eventually craved the com-
pany of a partner who would focus
more on their relationship and less on
the outside world, and he’s happily
married
now
to
just
such
a
wo-
man—but he’s glad for the time with
his ex-girlfriend.
As Tom talks, I think of how much I
miss my husband, Ken, who’s back
home in New York and not a sensitive
type either, far from it. Sometimes this
is frustrating: if something moves me to
443/929
tears of empathy or anxiety, he’ll be
touched, but grow impatient if I stay
that way too long. But I also know that
his tougher attitude is good for me, and
I find his company endlessly delightful.
I love his effortless charm. I love that
he never runs out of interesting things
to say. I love how he pours his heart
and soul into everything he does, and
everyone
he
loves,
especially
our
family.
But most of all I love his way of ex-
pressing compassion. Ken may be ag-
gressive, more aggressive in a week
than I’ll be in a lifetime, but he uses it
on behalf of others. Before we met, he
worked for the UN in war zones all
over the world, where, among other
things, he conducted prisoner-of-war
and detainee release negotiations. He
would march into fetid jails and face
down camp commanders with machine
444/929
guns strapped to their chests until they
agreed to release young girls who’d
committed no crime other than to be
female and victims of rape. After many
years on the job, he went home and
wrote down what he’d witnessed, in
books and articles that bristled with
rage. He didn’t write in the style of a
sensitive person, and he made a lot of
people angry. But he wrote like a per-
son who cares, desperately.
I thought that Walker Creek Ranch
would make me long for a world of the
highly
sensitive,
a
world
in
which
everyone speaks softly and no one car-
ries a big stick. But instead it reinforced
my deeper yearning for balance. This
balance, I think, is what Elaine Aron
would say is our natural state of being,
at least in Indo-European cultures like
ours, which she observes have long
been divided into “warrior kings” and
445/929
“priestly advisers,” into the executive
branch and the judicial branch, into
bold and easy FDRs and sensitive, con-
scientious Eleanor Roosevelts.

WHY DID WALL STREET CRASH AND
WARREN BUFFETT PROSPER?
How Introverts and Extroverts Think
(and Process Dopamine) Differently
Tocqueville saw that the life of constant
action and decision which was entailed
by the democratic and businesslike char-
acter of American life put a premium
upon rough and ready habits of mind,
quick decision, and the prompt seizure of
opportunities—and that all this activity
was not propitious for deliberation, elab-
oration, or precision in thought.
—RICHARD HOFSTADTER, IN Anti-Intel-
lectualism in America
Just after 7:30 a.m. on December 11,
2008, the year of the great stock mar-
ket crash, Dr. Janice Dorn’s phone rang.
The markets had opened on the East
Coast to another session of carnage.
Housing prices were plummeting, credit
markets were frozen, and GM teetered
on the brink of bankruptcy.
Dorn took the call from her bedroom,
as she often does, wearing a headset
and perched atop her green duvet. The
room was decorated sparely. The most
colorful thing in it was Dorn herself,
who, with her flowing red hair, ivory
skin, and trim frame, looks like a ma-
ture version of Lady Godiva. Dorn has a
PhD in neuroscience, with a specialty in
brain
anatomy.
She’s
also
an
MD
trained in psychiatry, an active trader
in the gold futures market, and a “fin-
ancial psychiatrist” who has counseled
an estimated six hundred traders.
448/929
“Hi,
Janice!”
said
the
caller
that
morning,
a
confident-sounding
man
named Alan. “Do you have time to
talk?”
Dr. Dorn did not have time. A day
trader who prides herself on being in
and out of trading positions every half
hour, she was eager to start trading.
But Dorn heard a desperate note in
Alan’s voice. She agreed to take the
call.
Alan was a sixty-year-old midwest-
erner who struck Dorn as a salt-of-the-
earth type, hardworking and loyal. He
had the jovial and assertive manner of
an extrovert, and he maintained his
good cheer despite the story of disaster
he proceeded to tell. Alan and his wife
had worked all their lives, and man-
aged to sock away a million dollars for
retirement. But four months earlier he’d
gotten the idea that, despite having no
449/929
experience in the markets, he should
buy a hundred thousand dollars’ worth
of GM stock, based on reports that the
U.S. government might bail out the
auto industry. He was convinced it was
a no-lose investment.
After his trade went through, the me-
dia reported that the bailout might not
happen after all. The market sold off
GM and the stock price fell. But Alan
imagined the thrill of winning big. It
felt so real he could taste it. He held
firm. The stock fell again, and again,
and kept dropping until finally Alan de-
cided to sell, at a big loss.
There was worse to come. When the
next news cycle suggested that the bail-
out would happen after all, Alan got ex-
cited all over again and invested anoth-
er hundred thousand dollars, buying
more stock at the lower price. But the
450/929
same thing happened: the bailout star-
ted looking uncertain.
Alan “reasoned” (this word is in quo-
tation
marks
because,
according
to
Dorn, conscious reasoning had little to
do with Alan’s behavior) that the price
couldn’t go much lower. He held on, sa-
voring the idea of how much fun he
and his wife would have spending all
the money he stood to make. Again the
stock went lower. When finally it hit
seven dollars per share, Alan sold. And
bought yet again, in a flush of exhilara-
tion, when he heard that the bailout
might happen after all …
By the time GM’s stock price fell to
two dollars a share, Alan had lost seven
hundred thousand dollars, or 70 percent
of his family nest egg.
He was devastated. He asked Dorn if
she could help recoup his losses. She
could not. “It’s gone,” she told him.
451/929
“You are never going to make that
money back.”
He asked what he’d done wrong.
Dorn had many ideas about that. As
an amateur, Alan shouldn’t have been
trading in the first place. And he’d
risked far too much money; he should
have limited his exposure to 5 percent
of his net worth, or $50,000. But the
biggest problem may have been beyond
Alan’s control: Dorn believed he was
experiencing an excess of something
psychologists call reward sensitivity.
A reward-sensitive person is highly
motivated to seek rewards—from a pro-
motion to a lottery jackpot to an enjoy-
able evening out with friends. Reward
sensitivity motivates us to pursue goals
like sex and money, social status and
influence. It prompts us to climb lad-
ders and reach for faraway branches in
order to gather life’s choicest fruits.
452/929
But sometimes we’re too sensitive to
rewards. Reward sensitivity on over-
drive gets people into all kinds of
trouble. We can get so excited by the
prospect of juicy prizes, like winning
big in the stock market, that we take
outsized risks and ignore obvious warn-
ing signals.
Alan was presented with plenty of
these signals, but was so animated by
the prospect of winning big that he
couldn’t see them. Indeed, he fell into a
classic pattern of reward sensitivity run
amok: at exactly the moments when the
warning signs suggested slowing down,
he
sped
up—dumping
money
he
couldn’t afford to lose into a speculat-
ive series of trades.
Financial history is full of examples
of
players
accelerating
when
they
should be braking. Behavioral econom-
ists have long observed that executives
453/929
buying companies can get so excited
about
beating
out
their
competitors
that they ignore signs that they’re over-
paying. This happens so frequently that
it has a name: “deal fever,” followed by
“the winner’s curse.” The AOL–Time
Warner merger, which wiped out $200
billion
of
Time
Warner
shareholder
value, is a classic example. There were
plenty of warnings that AOL’s stock,
which was the currency for the merger,
was
wildly
overvalued,
yet
Time
Warner’s directors approved the deal
unanimously.
“I did it with as much or more excite-
ment and enthusiasm as I did when I
first made love some forty-two years
ago,” exclaimed Ted Turner, one of
those directors and the largest individu-
al shareholder in the company. “TED
TURNER: IT’S BETTER THAN SEX,” an-
nounced the New York Post the day
454/929
after the deal was struck, a headline to
which we’ll return for its power to ex-
plain why smart people can sometimes
be too reward-sensitive.
You may be wondering what all this
has to do with introversion and extro-
version. Don’t we all get a little carried
away sometimes?
The answer is yes, except that some
of us do so more than others. Dorn has
observed that her extroverted clients
are more likely to be highly reward-
sensitive, while the introverts are more
likely to pay attention to warning sig-
nals. They’re more successful at regulat-
ing their feelings of desire or excite-
ment. They protect themselves better
from
the
downside.
“My
introvert
455/929
traders are much more able to say, ‘OK,
Janice, I do feel these excited emotions
coming up in me, but I understand that
I can’t act on them.’ The introverts are
much better at making a plan, staying
with a plan, being very disciplined.”
To understand why introverts and ex-
troverts might react differently to the
prospect of rewards, says Dorn, you
have to know a little about brain struc-
ture. As we saw in chapter 4, our limbic
system, which we share with the most
primitive mammals and which Dorn
calls the “old brain,” is emotional and
instinctive. It comprises various struc-
tures, including the amygdala, and it’s
highly interconnected with the nucleus
accumbens,
sometimes
called
the
brain’s “pleasure center.” We examined
the anxious side of the old brain when
we explored the role of the amygdala in
456/929
high reactivity and introversion. Now
we’re about to see its greedy side.
The old brain, according to Dorn, is
constantly telling us, “Yes, yes, yes! Eat
more, drink more, have more sex, take
lots of risk, go for all the gusto you can
get, and above all, do not think!” The
reward-seeking, pleasure-loving part of
the old brain is what Dorn believes
spurred Alan to treat his life savings
like chips at the casino.
We also have a “new brain” called
the neocortex, which evolved many
thousands of years after the limbic sys-
tem. The new brain is responsible for
thinking,
planning,
language,
and
decision-making—some of the very fac-
ulties that make us human. Although
the new brain also plays a significant
role in our emotional lives, it’s the seat
of
rationality.
Its
job,
according
to
Dorn, includes saying, “No, no, no!
457/929
Don’t do that, because it’s dangerous,
makes no sense, and is not in your best
interests, or those of your family, or of
society.”
So where was Alan’s neocortex when
he was chasing stock market gains?
The old brain and the new brain do
work together, but not always effi-
ciently. Sometimes they’re actually in
conflict, and then our decisions are a
function of which one is sending out
stronger signals. So when Alan’s old
brain sent its breathless messages up to
his new brain, it probably responded as
a neocortex should: it told his old brain
to slow down. It said, Watch out! But it
lost the ensuing tug-of-war.
We all have old brains, of course. But
just as the amygdala of a high-reactive
person is more sensitive than average
to novelty, so do extroverts seem to be
more susceptible than introverts to the
458/929
reward-seeking
cravings
of
the
old
brain. In fact, some scientists are start-
ing to explore the idea that reward-
sensitivity is not only an interesting fea-
ture of extroversion; it is what makes an
extrovert an extrovert. Extroverts, in
other words, are characterized by their
tendency to seek rewards, from top dog
status to sexual highs to cold cash.
They’ve been found to have greater
economic, political, and hedonistic am-
bitions than introverts; even their soci-
ability is a function of reward-sensitiv-
ity, according to this view—extroverts
socialize because human connection is
inherently gratifying.
What underlies all this reward-seek-
ing? The key seems to be positive emo-
tion.
Extroverts
tend
to
experience
more pleasure and excitement than in-
troverts do—emotions that are activ-
ated, explains the psychologist Daniel
459/929
Nettle in his illuminating book on per-
sonality, “in response to the pursuit or
capture of some resource that is valued.
Excitement builds towards the anticip-
ated capture of that resource. Joy fol-
lows its capture.” Extroverts, in other
words, often find themselves in an emo-
tional state we might call “buzz”—a
rush of energized, enthusiastic feelings.
This is a sensation we all know and
like, but not necessarily to the same de-
gree or with the same frequency: extro-
verts seem to get an extra buzz from
the pursuit and attainment of their
goals.
The basis of buzz appears to be a
high degree of activity in a network of
structures in the brain—often called the
“reward system”—including the orbito-
frontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens,
and the amygdala. The job of the re-
ward system is to get us excited about
460/929
potential
goodies;
fMRI
experiments
have shown that the system is activated
by any number of possible delights,
from anticipation of a squirt of Kool-
Aid on the tongue, to money, to pic-
tures of attractive people.
The neurons that transmit informa-
tion in the reward network operate in
part
through
a
neurotransmitter—a
chemical
that
carries
information
between brain cells—called dopamine.
Dopamine is the “reward chemical” re-
leased in response to anticipated pleas-
ures. The more responsive your brain is
to dopamine, or the higher the level of
dopamine you have available to re-
lease, some scientists believe, the more
likely you are to go after rewards like
sex,
chocolate,
money,
and
status.
Stimulating mid-brain dopamine activ-
ity in mice gets them to run around ex-
citedly in an empty cage until they
461/929
drop dead of starvation. Cocaine and
heroin, which stimulate dopamine-re-
leasing
neurons
in
humans,
make
people euphoric.
Extroverts’ dopamine pathways ap-
pear to be more active than those of in-
troverts. Although the exact relation-
ship between extroversion, dopamine,
and the brain’s reward system has not
been
conclusively
established,
early
findings have been intriguing. In one
experiment, Richard Depue, a neurobio-
logist at Cornell University, gave an
amphetamine that activates the dopam-
ine system to a group of introverts and
extroverts, and found that the extro-
verts had a stronger response. Another
study found that extroverts who win
gambling games have more activity in
the reward-sensitive regions of their
brains than victorious introverts do.
Still other research has shown that the
462/929
medial orbitofrontal cortex, a key com-
ponent of the brain’s dopamine-driven
reward system, is larger in extroverts
than in introverts.
By contrast, introverts “have a smal-
ler response” in the reward system,
writes psychologist Nettle, “and so go
less out of their way to follow up [re-
ward] cues.” They will, “like anyone,
be drawn from time to time to sex, and
parties, and status, but the kick they get
will be relatively small, so they are not
going to break a leg to get there.” In
short,
introverts
just
don’t
buzz
as
easily.
In some ways, extroverts are lucky;
buzz
has
a
delightful
champagne-
bubble quality. It fires us up to work
463/929
and play hard. It gives us the courage
to take chances. Buzz also gets us to do
things that would otherwise seem too
difficult, like giving speeches. Imagine
you work hard to prepare a talk on a
subject you care about. You get your
message across, and when you finish
the audience rises to its feet, its clap-
ping sustained and sincere. One person
might leave the room feeling, “I’m glad
I got my message across, but I’m also
happy it’s over; now I can get back to
the rest of my life.” Another person,
more sensitive to buzz, might walk
away feeling, “What a trip! Did you
hear that applause? Did you see the ex-
pression on their faces when I made
that life-changing point? This is great!”
But buzz also has considerable down-
sides. “Everyone assumes that it’s good
to accentuate positive emotions, but
that
isn’t
correct,”
the
psychology
464/929
professor
Richard
Howard
told
me,
pointing to the example of soccer vic-
tories that end in violence and property
damage. “A lot of antisocial and self-de-
feating behavior results from people
who amplify positive emotions.”
Another disadvantage of buzz may be
its connection to risk—sometimes out-
sized risk. Buzz can cause us to ignore
warning signs we should be heeding.
When Ted Turner (who appears to be
an extreme extrovert) compared the
AOL–Time Warner deal to his first sexu-
al experience, he may have been telling
us that he was in the same buzzy state
of mind as an adolescent who’s so ex-
cited about spending the night with his
new girlfriend that he’s not thinking
much
about
the
consequences.
This
blindness to danger may explain why
extroverts are more likely than intro-
verts to be killed while driving, be
465/929
hospitalized as a result of accident or
injury, smoke, have risky sex, particip-
ate in high-risk sports, have affairs, and
remarry. It also helps explain why ex-
troverts are more prone than introverts
to overconfidence—defined as greater
confidence unmatched by greater abil-
ity. Buzz is JFK’s Camelot, but it’s also
the Kennedy Curse.
This
theory
of
extroversion
is
still
young, and it is not absolute. We can’t
say that all extroverts constantly crave
rewards or that all introverts always
brake for trouble. Still, the theory sug-
gests that we should rethink the roles
that introverts and extroverts play in
their own lives, and in organizations. It
suggests that when it comes time to
466/929
make group decisions, extroverts would
do well to listen to introverts—espe-
cially when they see problems ahead.
In the wake of the 2008 crash, a fin-
ancial catastrophe caused in part by
uncalculated risk-taking and blindness
to threat, it became fashionable to spec-
ulate whether we’d have been better off
with more women and fewer men—or
less testosterone—on Wall Street. But
maybe we should also ask what might
have happened with a few more intro-
verts
at
the
helm—and
a
lot
less
dopamine.
Several studies answer this question
implicitly. Kellogg School of Manage-
ment Professor Camelia Kuhnen has
found that the variation of a dopamine-
regulating gene (DRD4) associated with
a particularly thrill-seeking version of
extroversion is a strong predictor of
financial
risk-taking.
By
contrast,
467/929
people with a variant of a serotonin-
regulating gene linked to introversion
and sensitivity take 28 percent less fin-
ancial risk than others. They have also
been found to outperform their peers
when playing gambling games calling
for
sophisticated
decision-making.
(When faced with a low probability of
winning, people with this gene variant
tend to be risk-averse; when they have
a high probability of winning, they be-
come relatively risk-seeking.) Another
study, of sixty-four traders at an invest-
ment bank, found that the highest-per-
forming traders tended to be emotion-
ally stable introverts.
Introverts also seem to be better than
extroverts at delaying gratification, a
crucial
life
skill
associated
with
everything from higher SAT scores and
income to lower body mass index. In
one study, scientists gave participants
468/929
the choice of a small reward immedi-
ately (a gift certificate from Amazon) or
a bigger gift certificate in two to four
weeks. Objectively, the bigger reward
in the near but not immediate future
was the more desirable option. But
many people went for the “I want it
now” choice—and when they did, a
brain scanner revealed that their re-
ward
network
was
activated.
Those
who held out for the larger reward two
weeks hence showed more activity in
the prefrontal cortex—the part of the
new brain that talks us out of sending
ill-considered e-mails and eating too
much chocolate cake. (A similar study
suggests that the former group tended
to be extroverts and the latter group
introverts.)
Back in the 1990s, when I was a juni-
or associate at a Wall Street law firm, I
found myself on a team of lawyers
469/929
representing a bank considering buying
a portfolio of subprime mortgage loans
made by other lenders. My job was to
perform due diligence—to review the
documentation to see whether the loans
had been made with the proper paper-
work. Had the borrowers been notified
of the interest rates they were slated to
pay? That the rates would go up over
time?
The papers turned out to be chock-
full of irregularities. If I’d been in the
bankers’ shoes, this would have made
me nervous, very nervous. But when
our legal team summarized the risks in
a
caution-filled
conference
call,
the
bankers
seemed
utterly
untroubled.
They saw the potential profits of buying
those loans at a discount, and they
wanted to go ahead with the deal. Yet
it was just this kind of risk-reward mis-
calculation
that
contributed
to
the
470/929
failure of many banks during the Great
Recession of 2008.
At about the same time I evaluated
that portfolio of loans, I heard a story
circulating on Wall Street about a com-
petition among investment banks for a
prestigious piece of business. Each of
the major banks sent a squad of their
top employees to pitch the client. Each
team deployed the usual tools: spread
sheets, “pitch books,” and PowerPoint
presentations. But the winning team ad-
ded its own piece of theatrics: they ran
into the room wearing matching base-
ball caps and T-shirts emblazoned with
the letters FUD, an acronym for Fear,
Uncertainty, and Doubt. In this case FUD
had been crossed out with an emphatic
red X; FUD was an unholy trinity. That
team, the vanquishers of FUD, won the
contest.
471/929
Disdain for FUD—and for the type of
person who tends to experience it—is
what
helped
cause
the
crash,
says
Boykin Curry, a managing director of
the investment firm Eagle Capital, who
had front-row seats to the 2008 melt-
down. Too much power was concen-
trated in the hands of aggressive risk-
takers. “For twenty years, the DNA of
nearly
every
financial
institu-
tion … morphed dangerously,” he told
Newsweek magazine at the height of the
crash. “Each time someone at the table
pressed for more leverage and more
risk, the next few years proved them
‘right.’ These people were emboldened,
they were promoted and they gained
control of ever more capital. Mean-
while, anyone in power who hesitated,
who argued for caution, was proved
‘wrong.’ The cautious types were in-
creasingly intimidated, passed over for
472/929
promotion. They lost their hold on cap-
ital. This happened every day in almost
every financial institution, over and
over, until we ended up with a very
specific kind of person running things.”
Curry is a Harvard Business School
grad
and,
with
his
wife,
Celerie
Kemble, a Palm Beach–born designer, a
prominent fixture on New York politic-
al and social scenes. Which is to say
that he would seem to be a card-carry-
ing member of what he calls the “go-go
aggressive” crowd, and an unlikely ad-
vocate for the importance of introverts.
But one thing he’s not shy about is his
thesis that it was forceful extroverts
who caused the global financial crash.
“People
with
certain
personality
types got control of capital and institu-
tions and power,” Curry told me. “And
people who are congenitally more cau-
tious and introverted and statistical in
473/929
their thinking became discredited and
pushed aside.”
Vincent Kaminski, a Rice University
business
school
professor
who
once
served as managing director of research
for Enron, the company that famously
filed for bankruptcy in 2001 as a result
of reckless business practices, told the
Washington Post a similar story of a
business culture in which aggressive
risk-takers enjoyed too high a status re-
lative to cautious introverts. Kaminski,
a soft-spoken and careful man, was one
of the few heroes of the Enron scandal.
He repeatedly tried to sound the alarm
with senior management that the com-
pany had entered into business deals
risky enough to threaten its survival.
When the top brass wouldn’t listen, he
refused to sign off on these dangerous
transactions and ordered his team not
to
work
on
them.
The
company
474/929
stripped him of his power to review
company-wide deals.
“There have been some complaints,
Vince, that you’re not helping people to
do transactions,” the president of Enron
told him, according to Conspiracy of
Fools, a book about the Enron scandal.
“Instead, you’re spending all your time
acting like cops. We don’t need cops,
Vince.”
But they did need them, and still do.
When the credit crisis threatened the
viability
of
some
of
Wall
Street’s
biggest banks in 2007, Kaminski saw
the
same
thing
happening
all
over
again.
“Let’s
just
say
that
all
the
demons of Enron have not been exor-
cised,” he told the Post in November of
that year. The problem, he explained,
was not only that many had failed to
understand the risks the banks were
taking. It was also that those who did
475/929
understand
were
consistently
ig-
nored—in part because they had the
wrong personality style: “Many times I
have been sitting across the table from
an energy trader and I would say, ‘Your
portfolio will implode if this specific
situation
happens.’
And
the
trader
would start yelling at me and telling me
I’m
an
idiot,
that
such
a situation
would never happen. The problem is
that, on one side, you have a rainmaker
who is making lots of money for the
company and is treated like a superstar,
and on the other side you have an in-
troverted nerd. So who do you think
wins?”
But what exactly is the mechanism by
which
buzz
clouds
good
judgment?
476/929
How did Janice Dorn’s client, Alan, dis-
miss the danger signs screaming that he
might lose 70 percent of his life sav-
ings? What prompts some people to act
as if FUD doesn’t exist?
One answer comes from an intriguing
line
of
research
conducted
by
the
University
of
Wisconsin
psychologist
Joseph Newman. Imagine that you’ve
been invited to Newman’s lab to parti-
cipate in one of his studies. You’re
there to play a game: the more points
you get, the more money you win.
Twelve different numbers flash across a
computer screen, one at a time, in no
particular order. You’re given a button,
as if you were a game-show contestant,
which you can press or not as each
number appears. If you press the button
for a “good” number, you win points; if
you press for a “bad” number, you lose
points; and if you don’t press at all,
477/929
nothing happens. Through trial and er-
ror you learn that four is a nice number
and nine is not. So the next time the
number nine flashes across your screen,
you know not to press that button.
Except that sometimes people press
the button for the bad numbers, even
when they should know better. Extro-
verts, especially highly impulsive extro-
verts, are more likely than introverts to
make this mistake. Why? Well, in the
words of psychologists John Brebner
and Chris Cooper, who have shown that
extroverts think less and act faster on
such tasks: introverts are “geared to in-
spect”
and
extroverts
“geared
to
respond.”
But the more interesting aspect of
this puzzling behavior is not what the
extroverts do before they’ve hit the
wrong button, but what they do after.
When introverts hit the number nine
478/929
button and find they’ve lost a point,
they slow down before moving on to
the next number, as if to reflect on
what went wrong. But extroverts not
only fail to slow down, they actually
speed up.
This seems strange; why would any-
one do this? Newman explains that it
makes perfect sense. If you focus on
achieving your goals, as reward-sensit-
ive extroverts do, you don’t want any-
thing
to
get
in
your
way—neither
naysayers nor the number nine. You
speed up in an attempt to knock these
roadblocks down.
Yet this is a crucially important mis-
step, because the longer you pause to
process surprising or negative feedback,
the more likely you are to learn from it.
If you force extroverts to pause, says
Newman, they’ll do just as well as in-
troverts at the numbers game. But, left
479/929
to their own devices, they don’t stop.
And so they don’t learn to avoid the
trouble staring them in the face. New-
man says that this is exactly what
might happen to extroverts like Ted
Turner when bidding for a company on
auction. “When a person bids up too
high,” he told me, “that’s because they
didn’t inhibit a response they should
have inhibited. They didn’t consider in-
formation that should have been weigh-
ing on their decision.”
Introverts, in contrast, are constitu-
tionally programmed to downplay re-
ward—to kill their buzz, you might
say—and scan for problems. “As soon
they
get
excited,”
says
Newman,
“they’ll put the brakes on and think
about peripheral issues that may be
more important. Introverts seem to be
specifically wired or trained so when
they catch themselves getting excited
480/929
and focused on a goal, their vigilance
increases.”
Introverts also tend to compare new
information with their expectations, he
says. They ask themselves, “Is this what
I thought would happen? Is it how it
should be?” And when the situation
falls short of expectations, they form as-
sociations between the moment of dis-
appointment
(losing
points)
and
whatever was going on in their envir-
onment at the time of the disappoint-
ment (hitting the number nine.) These
associations let them make accurate
predictions about how to react to warn-
ing signals in the future.
Introverts’
disinclination
to
charge
ahead is not only a hedge against risk;
481/929
it also pays off on intellectual tasks.
Here are some of the things we know
about the relative performance of intro-
verts
and
extroverts
at
complex
problem-solving. Extroverts get better
grades than introverts during element-
ary school, but introverts outperform
extroverts in high school and college.
At
the
university
level,
introversion
predicts academic performance better
than cognitive ability. One study tested
141
college
students’
knowledge
of
twenty different subjects, from art to
astronomy to statistics, and found that
introverts knew more than the extro-
verts about every single one of them.
Introverts
receive
disproportionate
numbers of graduate degrees, National
Merit Scholarship finalist positions, and
Phi Beta Kappa keys. They outperform
extroverts on the Watson-Glaser Critical
Thinking Appraisal test, an assessment
482/929
of critical thinking widely used by busi-
nesses
for
hiring
and
promotion.
They’ve
been
shown
to
excel
at
something psychologists call “insightful
problem solving.”
The question is: Why?
Introverts are not smarter than extro-
verts. According to IQ scores, the two
types are equally intelligent. And on
many kinds of tasks, particularly those
performed under time or social pressure
or involving multitasking, extroverts do
better. Extroverts are better than intro-
verts at handling information overload.
Introverts’ reflectiveness uses up a lot
of
cognitive
capacity,
according
to
Joseph Newman. On any given task, he
says, “if we have 100 percent cognitive
capacity, an introvert may have only 75
percent on task and 25 percent off task,
whereas an extrovert may have 90 per-
cent on task.” This is because most
483/929
tasks are goal-directed. Extroverts ap-
pear to allocate most of their cognitive
capacity to the goal at hand, while in-
troverts use up capacity by monitoring
how the task is going.
But introverts seem to think more
carefully than extroverts, as the psycho-
logist Gerald Matthews describes in his
work. Extroverts are more likely to take
a quick-and-dirty approach to problem-
solving,
trading
accuracy
for
speed,
making increasing numbers of mistakes
as they go, and abandoning ship alto-
gether when the problem seems too dif-
ficult or frustrating. Introverts think be-
fore they act, digest information thor-
oughly, stay on task longer, give up less
easily, and work more accurately. Intro-
verts and extroverts also direct their at-
tention differently: if you leave them to
their own devices, the introverts tend
to sit around wondering about things,
484/929
imagining things, recalling events from
their past, and making plans for the fu-
ture. The extroverts are more likely to
focus
on
what’s
happening
around
them. It’s as if extroverts are seeing
“what is” while their introverted peers
are asking “what if.”
Introverts’ and extroverts’ contrasting
problem-solving styles have been ob-
served in many different contexts. In
one
experiment,
psychologists
gave
fifty people a difficult jigsaw puzzle to
solve, and found that the extroverts
were more likely than the introverts to
quit
midway.
In
another,
Professor
Richard Howard gave introverts and ex-
troverts a complicated series of printed
mazes, and found not only that the in-
troverts tended to solve more mazes
correctly, but also that they spent a
much greater percentage of their allot-
ted time inspecting the maze before
485/929
entering it. A similar thing happened
when groups of introverts and extro-
verts were given the Raven Standard
Progressive
Matrices,
an
intelligence
test that consists of five sets of prob-
lems of increasing difficulty. The extro-
verts tended to do better on the first
two sets, presumably because of their
ability to orient quickly to their goal.
But on the three more difficult sets,
where persistence pays, the introverts
significantly outperformed them. By the
final, most complicated set, the extro-
verts were much more likely than the
introverts
to
abandon
the
task
altogether.
Introverts sometimes outperform ex-
troverts even on social tasks that re-
quire
persistence.
Wharton
manage-
ment professor Adam Grant (who con-
ducted the leadership studies described
in
chapter
2)
once
studied
the
486/929
personality traits of effective call-center
employees. Grant predicted that the ex-
troverts would be better telemarketers,
but it turned out that there was zero
correlation between extroversion levels
and cold-calling prowess.
“The extroverts would make these
wonderful calls,” Grant told me, “but
then a shiny object of some kind would
cross their paths and they’d lose focus.”
The introverts, in contrast, “would talk
very quietly, but boom, boom, boom,
they were making those calls. They
were focused
and determined.”
The
only
extroverts
to
outperform
them
were those who also happened to be
unusually high scorers for a separate
personality trait measuring conscien-
tiousness.
Introvert
persistence
was
more than a match for extrovert buzz,
in other words, even at a task where
487/929
social skills might be considered at a
premium.
Persistence isn’t very glamorous. If
genius is one percent inspiration and
ninety-nine percent perspiration, then
as a culture we tend to lionize the one
percent. We love its flash and dazzle.
But
great
power
lies
in
the
other
ninety-nine percent.
“It’s not that I’m so smart,” said Ein-
stein, who was a consummate introvert.
“It’s that I stay with problems longer.”
None of this is to denigrate those who
forge ahead quickly, or to blindly glori-
fy the reflective and careful. The point
is that we tend to overvalue buzz and
discount the risks of reward-sensitivity:
488/929
we need to find a balance between ac-
tion and reflection.
For example, if you were staffing an
investment bank, management profess-
or Kuhnen told me, you’d want to hire
not only reward-sensitive types, who
are likely to profit from bull markets,
but also those who remain emotionally
more neutral. You’d want to make sure
that important corporate decisions re-
flect the input of both kinds of people,
not just one type. And you’d want to
know that individuals on all points of
the reward-sensitivity spectrum under-
stand their own emotional preferences
and can temper them to match market
conditions.
But it’s not just employers who bene-
fit from taking a closer look at their
employees. We also need to take a
closer look at ourselves. Understanding
where we fall on the reward-sensitivity
489/929
spectrum gives us the power to live our
lives well.
If you’re a buzz-prone extrovert, then
you’re lucky to enjoy lots of invigorat-
ing emotions. Make the most of them:
build things, inspire others, think big.
Start a company, launch a website,
build an elaborate tree house for your
kids. But also know that you’re operat-
ing with an Achilles’ heel that you must
learn to protect. Train yourself to spend
energy on what’s truly meaningful to
you instead of on activities that look
like they’ll deliver a quick buzz of
money or status or excitement. Teach
yourself
to pause and reflect when
warning signs appear that things aren’t
working out as you’d hoped. Learn
from your mistakes. Seek out counter-
parts (from spouses to friends to busi-
ness partners) who can help rein you in
and compensate for your blind spots.
490/929
And when it comes time to invest, or
to do anything that involves a sage bal-
ance of risk and reward, keep yourself
in check. One good way to do this is to
make sure that you’re not surrounding
yourself with images of reward at the
crucial moment of decision. Kuhnen
and Brian Knutson have found that men
who are shown erotic pictures just be-
fore they gamble take more risks than
those shown neutral images like desks
and chairs. This is because anticipating
rewards—any rewards, whether or not
related to the subject at hand—excites
our dopamine-driven reward networks
and makes us act more rashly. (This
may be the single best argument yet for
banning
pornography
from
workplaces.)
And if you’re an introvert who’s rel-
atively immune to the excesses of re-
ward sensitivity? At first blush, the
491/929
research on dopamine and buzz seems
to imply that extroverts, and extroverts
alone, are happily motivated to work
hard by the excitement they get from
pursuing their goals. As an introvert, I
was puzzled by this idea when I first
came across it. It didn’t reflect my own
experience. I’m in love with my work
and always have been. I wake up in the
morning excited to get started. So what
drives people like me?
One
answer
is
that
even
if
the
reward-sensitivity theory of extrover-
sion turns out to be correct, we can’t
say that all extroverts are always more
sensitive to rewards and blasé about
risk, or that all introverts are constantly
unmoved by incentives and vigilant
about threats. Since the days of Aris-
totle, philosophers have observed that
these two modes—approaching things
that
appear
to
give
pleasure
and
492/929
avoiding others that seem to cause
pain—lie at the heart of all human
activity. As a group, extroverts tend to
be reward-seeking, but every human
being has her own mix of approach and
avoidance tendencies, and sometimes
the combination differs depending on
the situation. Indeed, many contempor-
ary personality psychologists would say
that threat-vigilance is more character-
istic of a trait known as “neuroticism”
than of introversion. The body’s reward
and threat systems also seem to work
independently of each other, so that the
same person can be generally sensitive,
or
insensitive,
to
both
reward
and
threat.
493/929
If you want to determine whether
you are reward-oriented, threat-
oriented, or both, try asking your-
self whether the following groups
of statements are true of you.
If you are reward-oriented:
1. When I get something I want, I feel
excited and energized.
2. When I want something, I usually
go all out to get it.
3. When I see an opportunity for
something I like, I get excited
right away.
4. When good things happen to me, it
affects me strongly.
494/929
5. I have very few fears compared to
my friends.
If you are threat-oriented:
1. Criticism or scolding hurts me
quite a bit.
2. I feel pretty worried or upset when
I
think
or
know
somebody
is
angry at me.
3. If I think something unpleasant is
going to happen, I usually get
pretty “worked up.”
4. I feel worried when I think I have
done
poorly
at
something
important.
495/929
5. I worry about making mistakes.
But I believe that another important
explanation
for
introverts
who
love
their work may come from a very dif-
ferent line of research by the influential
psychologist
Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi
on the state of being he calls “flow.”
Flow is an optimal state in which you
feel
totally
engaged
in
an
activ-
ity—whether long-distance swimming
or songwriting, sumo wrestling or sex.
In a state of flow, you’re neither bored
nor anxious, and you don’t question
your
own
adequacy.
Hours
pass
without your noticing.
The key to flow is to pursue an activ-
ity for its own sake, not for the rewards
it brings. Although flow does not de-
pend
on
being
an
introvert
or
an
496/929
extrovert, many of the flow experiences
that Csikszentmihalyi writes about are
solitary pursuits that have nothing to
do with reward-seeking: reading, tend-
ing an orchard, solo ocean cruising.
Flow often occurs, he writes, in condi-
tions in which people “become inde-
pendent of the social environment to
the degree that they no longer respond
exclusively in terms of its rewards and
punishments.
To
achieve
such
autonomy, a person has to learn to
provide rewards to herself.”
In a sense, Csikszentmihalyi tran-
scends Aristotle; he is telling us that
there are some activities that are not
about approach or avoidance, but about
something deeper: the fulfillment that
comes from absorption in an activity
outside yourself. “Psychological theor-
ies usually assume that we are motiv-
ated either by the need to eliminate an
497/929
unpleasant condition like hunger or
fear,” Csikszentmihalyi writes, “or by
the expectation of some future reward
such as money, status, or prestige.” But
in flow, “a person could work around
the clock for days on end, for no better
reason than to keep on working.”
If you’re an introvert, find your flow
by using your gifts. You have the power
of persistence, the tenacity to solve
complex
problems,
and
the
clear-
sightedness to avoid pitfalls that trip
others up. You enjoy relative freedom
from
the
temptations
of
superficial
prizes like money and status. Indeed,
your biggest challenge may be to fully
harness your strengths. You may be so
busy trying to appear like a zestful,
reward-sensitive extrovert that you un-
dervalue your own talents, or feel un-
derestimated by those around you. But
when you’re focused on a project that
498/929
you care about, you probably find that
your energy is boundless.
So stay true to your own nature. If
you like to do things in a slow and
steady way, don’t let others make you
feel as if you have to race. If you enjoy
depth,
don’t
force
yourself
to
seek
breadth. If you prefer single-tasking to
multitasking, stick to your guns. Being
relatively unmoved by rewards gives
you the incalculable power to go your
own way. It’s up to you to use that in-
dependence to good effect.
Of course, that isn’t always easy.
While writing this chapter, I correspon-
ded with Jack Welch, the former chair-
man of General Electric. He had just
published
a
BusinessWeek
online
column called “Release Your Inner Ex-
trovert,” in which he called for intro-
verts to act more extroverted on the
job.
I
suggested
that
extroverts
499/929
sometimes need to act more introver-
ted, too, and shared with him some of
the ideas you’ve just read about how
Wall Street might have benefited from
having more introverts at the helm.
Welch was intrigued. But, he said, “the
extroverts would argue that they never
heard from the introverts.”
Welch makes a fair point. Introverts
need to trust their gut and share their
ideas as powerfully as they can. This
does not mean aping extroverts; ideas
can be shared quietly, they can be com-
municated in writing, they can be pack-
aged
into
highly
produced
lectures,
they can be advanced by allies. The
trick for introverts is to honor their
own styles instead of allowing them-
selves to be swept up by prevailing
norms. The story of the lead-up to the
Great Recession of 2008 is peppered,
alas,
with
careful
types
who
took
500/929
inappropriate
risks,
like
the
former
chief
executive
of
Citigroup,
Chuck
Prince, a former lawyer who made
risky loans into a falling market be-
cause, he said, “as long as the music is
playing,
you’ve
got
to
get
up
and
dance.”
“People who are initially cautious be-
come
more
aggressive,”
observes
Boykin
Curry
of
this
phenomenon.
“They say, ‘Hey, the more aggressive
people are getting promoted and I’m
not, so I’m going to be more aggressive
too.’ ”
But stories of financial crises often con-
tain subplots about people who fam-
ously (and profitably) saw them com-
ing—and such tales tend to feature just
501/929
the kinds of people who embrace FUD,
or who like to close the blinds to their
offices, insulate themselves from mass
opinion and peer pressure, and focus in
solitude. One of the few investors who
managed to flourish during the crash of
2008 was Seth Klarman, president of a
hedge fund called the Baupost Group.
Klarman is known for consistently out-
performing the market while steadfastly
avoiding risk, and for keeping a signi-
ficant percentage of his assets in cash.
In the two years since the crash of
2008, when most investors were fleeing
hedge funds in droves, Klarman almost
doubled Baupost’s assets under man-
agement to $22 billion.
Klarman achieved this with an in-
vestment strategy based explicitly on
FUD. “At Baupost, we are big fans of
fear, and in investing, it is clearly bet-
ter to be scared than sorry,” he once
502/929
wrote in a letter to investors. Klarman
is a “world-class worrier,” observes the
New York Times, in a 2007 article called
“Manager Frets Over the Market, But
Still Outdoes It.” He owns a racehorse
called “Read the Footnotes.”
During the years leading up to the
2008 crash, Klarman “was one of the
few people to stick to a cautious and
seemingly
paranoid
message,”
says
Boykin Curry. “When everyone else was
celebrating, he was probably storing
cans of tuna in his basement, to prepare
for the end of civilization. Then, when
everyone else panicked, he started buy-
ing. It’s not just analysis; it’s his emo-
tional makeup. The same wiring that
helps Seth find opportunities that no
one else sees can make him seem aloof
or blunt. If you’re the kind of person
who frets every time the quarter is
good, you may have trouble rising to
503/929
the top of a corporate pyramid. Seth
probably wouldn’t have made it as a
sales manager. But he is one of the
great investors of our time.”
Similarly, in his book on the run-up
to the 2008 crash, The Big Short, Mi-
chael Lewis introduces three of the few
people who were astute enough to fore-
cast the coming disaster. One was a
solitary
hedge-fund
manager
named
Michael Burry who describes himself as
“happy in my own head” and who
spent the years prior to the crash alone
in his office in San Jose, California,
combing through financial documents
and
developing
his
own
contrarian
views of market risk. The others were a
pair
of
socially
awkward
investors
named Charlie Ledley and Jamie Mai,
whose entire investment strategy was
based on FUD: they placed bets that
had limited downside, but would pay
504/929
off handsomely if dramatic but unex-
pected changes occurred in the market.
It was not an investment strategy so
much as a life philosophy—a belief that
most situations were not as stable as
they appeared to be.
This “suited the two men’s personal-
ities,” writes Lewis. “They never had to
be sure of anything. Both were predis-
posed to feel that people, and by exten-
sion markets, were too certain about in-
herently uncertain things.” Even after
being proven right with their 2006 and
2007 bets against the subprime mort-
gage market, and earning $100 million
in the process, “they actually spent
time wondering how people who had
been so sensationally right (i.e., they
themselves) could preserve the capacity
for diffidence and doubt and uncer-
tainty that had enabled them to be
right.”
505/929
Ledley and Mai understood the value
of their constitutional diffidence, but
others were so spooked by it that they
gave up the chance to invest money
with the two—in effect, sacrificing mil-
lions
of
dollars
to
their
prejudice
against
FUD.
“What’s
amazing
with
Charlie
Ledley,”
says
Boykin
Curry,
who knows him well, “is that here you
had a brilliant investor who was ex-
ceedingly
conservative.
If
you
were
concerned about risk, there was no one
better to go to. But he was terrible at
raising capital because he seemed so
tentative about everything. Potential
clients would walk out of Charlie’s of-
fice scared to give him money because
they
thought
he
lacked
conviction.
Meanwhile, they poured money into
funds run by managers who exuded
confidence and certainty. Of course,
when
the
economy
turned,
the
506/929
confident group lost half their clients’
money, while Charlie and Jamie made
a fortune. Anyone who used conven-
tional social cues to evaluate money
managers was led to exactly the wrong
conclusion.”
Another example, this one from the
2000 crash of the dot-com bubble, con-
cerns a self-described introvert based in
Omaha,
Nebraska,
where
he’s
well
known for shutting himself inside his
office for hours at a time.
Warren
Buffett,
the
legendary
in-
vestor and one of the wealthiest men in
the world, has used exactly the attrib-
utes we’ve explored in this chapter—in-
tellectual persistence, prudent thinking,
and the ability
to see and act on
507/929
warning signs—to make billions of dol-
lars for himself and the shareholders in
his company, Berkshire Hathaway. Buf-
fett is known for thinking carefully
when
those
around
him
lose
their
heads. “Success in investing doesn’t
correlate with IQ,” he has said. “Once
you have ordinary intelligence, what
you need is the temperament to control
the urges that get other people into
trouble in investing.”
Every
summer
since
1983,
the
boutique investment bank Allen & Co.
has hosted a weeklong conference in
Sun Valley, Idaho. This isn’t just any
conference. It’s an extravaganza, with
lavish parties, river-rafting trips, ice-
skating, mountain biking, fly fishing,
horseback riding, and a fleet of babysit-
ters to care for guests’ children. The
hosts service the media industry, and
past
guest
lists
have
included
508/929
newspaper moguls, Hollywood celebrit-
ies, and Silicon Valley stars, with mar-
quee names such as Tom Hanks, Can-
dice Bergen, Barry Diller, Rupert Mur-
doch, Steve Jobs, Diane Sawyer, and
Tom Brokaw.
In
July
1999,
according
to
Alice
Schroeder’s excellent biography of Buf-
fett, The Snowball, he was one of those
guests. He had attended year after year
with his entire family in tow, arriving
by Gulfstream jet and staying with the
other VIP attendees in a select group of
condos
overlooking
the
golf
course.
Buffett loved his annual vacation at Sun
Valley, regarding it as a great place for
his family to gather and for him to
catch up with old friends.
But this year the mood was different.
It was the height of the technology
boom, and there were new faces at the
table—the
heads
of
technology
509/929
companies that had grown rich and
powerful
almost
overnight,
and
the
venture capitalists who had fed them
cash. These people were riding high.
When the celebrity photographer Annie
Leibovitz
showed
up
to
shoot
“the
Media All-Star Team” for Vanity Fair,
some of them lobbied to get in the
photo.
They
were
the
future,
they
believed.
Buffett was decidedly not a part of
this group. He was an old-school in-
vestor who didn’t get caught up in
speculative frenzy around companies
with unclear earnings prospects. Some
dismissed him as a relic of the past. But
Buffett was still powerful enough to
give the keynote address on the final
day of the conference.
He thought long and hard about that
speech and spent weeks preparing for
it. After warming up the crowd with a
510/929
charmingly self-deprecating story—Buf-
fett used to dread public speaking until
he took a Dale Carnegie course—he
told the crowd, in painstaking, bril-
liantly analyzed detail, why the tech-
fueled bull market wouldn’t last. Buffett
had studied the data, noted the danger
signals, and then paused and reflected
on what they meant. It was the first
public forecast he had made in thirty
years.
The audience wasn’t thrilled, accord-
ing to Schroeder. Buffett was raining on
their parade. They gave him a standing
ovation, but in private, many dismissed
his ideas. “Good old Warren,” they said.
“Smart man, but this time he missed
the boat.”
Later that evening, the conference
wrapped up with a glorious display of
fireworks. As always, it had been a
blazing success. But the most important
511/929
aspect of the gathering—Warren Buffett
alerting
the
crowd
to
the
market’s
warning signs—wouldn’t be revealed
until the following year, when the dot-
com bubble burst, just as he said it
would.
Buffett takes pride not only in his
track record, but also in following his
own “inner scorecard.” He divides the
world into people who focus on their
own instincts and those who follow the
herd. “I feel like I’m on my back,” says
Buffett about his life as an investor,
“and there’s the Sistine Chapel, and I’m
painting away. I like it when people
say, ‘Gee, that’s a pretty good-looking
painting.’ But it’s my painting, and
when somebody says, ‘Why don’t you
use more red instead of blue?’ Good-
bye. It’s my painting. And I don’t care
what they sell it for. The painting itself
512/929
will never be finished. That’s one of the
great things about it.”

DO ALL CULTURES HAVE AN
EXTROVERT IDEAL?

SOFT POWER
Asian-Americans and the Extrovert Ideal
In a gentle way, you can shake the
world.
—MAHATMA GANDHI
It’s a sunny spring day in 2006, and
Mike
Wei,
a
seventeen-year-old
Chinese-born senior at Lynbrook High
School near Cupertino, California, is
telling me about his experiences as an
Asian-American
student.
Mike
is
dressed in sporty all-American attire of
khakis, windbreaker, and baseball cap,
but his sweet, serious face and wispy
mustache
give
him
the
aura
of
a
budding philosopher, and he speaks so
softly that I have to lean forward to
hear him.
“At school,” says Mike, “I’m a lot
more interested in listening to what the
teacher says and being the good stu-
dent, rather than the class clown or in-
teracting with other kids in the class. If
being outgoing, shouting, or acting out
in class is gonna affect the education I
receive, it’s better if I go for education.”
Mike
relates
this
view
matter-of-
factly, but he seems to know how un-
usual it is by American standards. His
attitude comes from his parents, he ex-
plains. “If I have a choice between do-
ing something for myself, like going out
with my friends, or staying home and
studying, I think of my parents. That
gives me the strength to keep studying.
My father tells me that his job is
516/929
computer programming, and my job is
to study.”
Mike’s mother taught the same lesson
by example. A former math teacher
who worked as a maid when the family
immigrated
to
North
America,
she
memorized English vocabulary words
while washing dishes. She is very quiet,
says Mike, and very resolute. “It’s really
Chinese to pursue your own education
like that. My mother has the kind of
strength that not everyone can see.”
By all indications, Mike has made his
parents proud. His e-mail username is
“A-student,”
and
he’s
just
won
a
coveted spot in Stanford University’s
freshman
class.
He’s
the
kind
of
thoughtful, dedicated student that any
community would be proud to call its
own. And yet, according to an article
called “The New White Flight” that ran
in
the
Wall
Street
Journal
just
six
517/929
months previously, white families are
leaving Cupertino in droves, precisely
because of kids like Mike. They are
fleeing the sky-high test scores and
awe-inspiring
study
habits
of
many
Asian-American students. The article
said that white parents feared that their
kids couldn’t keep up academically. It
quoted a student from a local high
school: “If you were Asian, you had to
confirm you were smart. If you were
white, you had to prove it.”
But the article didn’t explore what
lay behind this stellar academic per-
formance. I was curious whether the
town’s scholarly bent reflected a culture
insulated from the worst excesses of the
Extrovert Ideal—and if so, what that
would feel like. I decided to visit and
find out.
At first blush, Cupertino seems like
the
embodiment
of
the
American
518/929
Dream. Many first- and second-genera-
tion Asian immigrants live here and
work at the local high-tech office parks.
Apple Computer’s headquarters at 1 In-
finite Loop is in town. Google’s Moun-
tain View headquarters is just down the
road.
Meticulously
maintained
cars
glide along the boulevards; the few
pedestrians are crisply dressed in bright
colors and cheerful whites. Unprepos-
sessing ranch houses are pricey, but
buyers think the cost is worth it to get
their kids into the town’s famed public
school system, with its ranks of Ivy-
bound kids. Of the 615 students in the
graduating class of 2010 at Cupertino’s
Monta Vista High School (77 percent of
whom are Asian-American, according
to the school’s website, some of which
is accessible in Chinese), 53 were Na-
tional Merit Scholarship semifinalists.
The average combined score of Monta
519/929
Vista students who took the SAT in
2009 was 1916 out of 2400, 27 percent
higher than the nationwide average.
Respected kids at Monta Vista High
School are not necessarily athletic or
vivacious, according to the students I
meet here. Rather, they’re studious and
sometimes quiet. “Being smart is actu-
ally admired, even if you’re weird,” a
Korean-American high school sopho-
more named Chris tells me. Chris de-
scribes the experience of his friend,
whose family left to spend two years in
a Tennessee town where few Asian-
Americans lived. The friend enjoyed it,
but suffered culture shock. In Tennessee
“there were insanely smart people, but
they were always by themselves. Here,
the really smart people usually have a
lot of friends, because they can help
people out with their work.”
520/929
The library is to Cupertino what the
mall or soccer field is to other towns:
an unofficial center of village life. High
school kids cheerfully refer to studying
as “going nerding.” Football and cheer-
leading
aren’t
particularly
respected
activities. “Our football team sucks,”
Chris says good-naturedly. Though the
team’s recent stats are more impressive
than Chris suggests, having a lousy
football team seems to hold symbolic
significance
for
him.
“You
couldn’t
really even tell they’re football play-
ers,” he explains. “They don’t wear
their jackets and travel in big groups.
When one of my friends graduated,
they played a video and my friend was
like, ‘I can’t believe they’re showing
football players and cheerleaders in this
video.’
That’s
not
what
drives
this
town.”
521/929
Ted Shinta, a teacher and adviser to
the Robotics Team at Monta Vista High
School,
tells
me
something
similar.
“When I was in high school,” he says,
“you were discouraged from voting in
student elections unless you were wear-
ing
a
varsity
jacket.
At
most
high
schools you have a popular group that
tyrannizes the others. But here the kids
in that group don’t hold any power
over the other students. The student
body is too academically oriented for
that.”
A
local
college
counselor
named
Purvi Modi agrees. “Introversion is not
looked down upon,” she tells me. “It is
accepted. In some cases it is even
highly respected and admired. It is cool
to be a Master Chess Champion and
play in the band.” There’s an introvert-
extrovert
spectrum
here,
as
every-
where, but it’s as if the population is
522/929
distributed a few extra degrees toward
the introverted end of the scale. One
young
woman,
a
Chinese-American
about to begin her freshman year at an
elite East Coast college, noticed this
phenomenon after meeting some of her
future classmates online, and worries
what the post-Cupertino future might
hold. “I met a couple of people on Face-
book,” she says, “and they’re just so dif-
ferent. I’m really quiet. I’m not that
much of a partier or socializer, but
everyone there seems to be very social
and stuff. It’s just very different from
my friends. I’m not even sure if I’m
gonna have friends when I get there.”
One of her Facebook correspondents
lives in nearby Palo Alto, and I ask how
she’ll respond if that person invites her
to get together over the summer.
“I probably wouldn’t do it,” she says.
“It would be interesting to meet them
523/929
and stuff, but my mom doesn’t want me
going out that much, because I have to
study.”
I’m struck by the young woman’s
sense of filial obligation, and its con-
nection to prioritizing study over social
life. But this is not unusual in Cuper-
tino. Many Asian-American kids here
tell me that they study all summer at
their parents’ request, even declining
invitations to July birthday parties so
they can get ahead on the following
October’s calculus curriculum.
“I think it’s our culture,” explains
Tiffany
Liao,
a
poised
Swarthmore-
bound high school senior whose par-
ents are from Taiwan. “Study, do well,
don’t create waves. It’s inbred in us to
be more quiet. When I was a kid and
would go to my parents’ friends’ house
and didn’t want to talk, I would bring a
book. It was like this shield, and they
524/929
would be like, ‘She’s so studious!’ And
that was praise.”
It’s hard to imagine other American
moms and dads outside Cupertino smil-
ing on a child who reads in public
while everyone else is gathered around
the barbecue. But parents schooled a
generation ago in Asian countries were
likely taught this quieter style as chil-
dren. In many East Asian classrooms,
the traditional curriculum emphasizes
listening, writing, reading, and memor-
ization. Talking is simply not a focus,
and is even discouraged.
“The teaching back home is very dif-
ferent from here,” says Hung Wei Chi-
en, a Cupertino mom who came to the
United States from Taiwan in 1979 to
attend
graduate
school
at
UCLA.
“There, you learn the subject, and they
test you. At least when I grew up, they
don’t go off subject a lot, and they don’t
525/929
allow the students to ramble. If you
stand up and talk nonsense, you’ll be
reprimanded.”
Hung is one of the most jolly, extro-
verted people I’ve ever met, given to
large, expansive gestures and frequent
belly laughs. Dressed in running shorts,
sneakers, and amber jewelry, she greets
me with a bear hug and drives us to a
bakery for breakfast. We dig into our
pastries, chatting companionably.
So it’s telling that even Hung recalls
her culture shock upon entering her
first American-style classroom. She con-
sidered it rude to participate in class
because she didn’t want to waste her
classmates’ time. And sure enough, she
says, laughing, “I was the quiet person
there. At UCLA, the professor would
start
class,
saying,
‘Let’s
discuss!’
I
would look at my peers while they
were
talking
nonsense,
and
the
526/929
professors were so patient, just listening
to everyone.” She nods her head comic-
ally, mimicking the overly respectful
professors.
“I remember being amazed. It was a
linguistics class, and that’s not even lin-
guistics the students are talking about! I
thought, ‘Oh, in the U.S., as soon as you
start talking, you’re fine.’ ”
If Hung was bewildered by the Amer-
ican style of class participation, it’s
likely that her teachers were equally
perplexed
by
her
unwillingness
to
speak. A full twenty years after Hung
moved to the United States, the San
Jose Mercury News ran an article called
“East, West Teaching Traditions Col-
lide,” exploring professors’ dismay at
the reluctance of Asian-born students
like Hung to participate in California
university
classrooms.
One
professor
noted a “deference barrier” created by
527/929
Asian
students’
reverence
for
their
teachers. Another vowed to make class
participation part of the grade in order
to prod Asian students to speak in class.
“You’re supposed to downgrade your-
self in Chinese learning because other
thinkers are so much greater than you,”
said a third. “This is a perennial prob-
lem
in
classes
with
predominantly
Asian-American students.”
The article generated a passionate re-
action
in
the
Asian-American
com-
munity. Some said the universities were
right that Asian students need to adapt
to Western educational norms. “Asian-
Americans have let people walk all over
them because of their silence,” posted a
reader of the sardonically titled website
ModelMinority.com.
Others
felt
that
Asian students shouldn’t be forced to
speak up and conform to the Western
mode. “Perhaps instead of trying to
528/929
change their ways, colleges can learn to
listen to their sound of silence,” wrote
Heejung Kim, a Stanford University cul-
tural psychologist, in a paper arguing
that talking is not always a positive act.
How is it that Asians and Westerners
can look at the exact same classroom
interactions, and one group will label it
“class
participation”
and
the
other
“talking nonsense”? The Journal of Re-
search in Personality has published an
answer to this question in the form of a
map of the world drawn by research
psychologist Robert McCrae. McCrae’s
map looks like something you’d see in a
geography textbook, but it’s based, he
says, “not on rainfall or population
density, but on personality trait levels,”
529/929
and its shadings of dark and light
grays—dark for extroversion, light for
introversion—reveal a picture that “is
quite
clear:
Asia … is
introverted,
Europe extroverted.” Had the map also
included the United States, it would be
colored dark gray. Americans are some
of
the
most
extroverted
people
on
earth.
McCrae’s map might seem like a
grand exercise in cultural stereotyping.
To group entire continents by personal-
ity type is an act of gross generaliza-
tion: you can find loud people in main-
land China just as easily as in Atlanta,
Georgia. Nor does the map account for
subtleties of cultural difference within a
country or region. People in Beijing
have
different
styles
from
those
in
Shanghai, and both are different still
from the citizens of Seoul or Tokyo.
Similarly, describing Asians as a “model
530/929
minority”—even when meant as a com-
pliment—is just as confining and con-
descending as any description that re-
duces individuals to a set of perceived
group characteristics. Perhaps it is also
problematic to characterize Cupertino
as an incubator for scholarly stand-outs,
no matter how flattering this might
sound to some.
But although I don’t want to encour-
age rigid national or ethnic typecasting,
to avoid entirely the topic of cultural
difference and introversion would be a
shame: there are too many aspects of
Asian cultural and personality styles
that the rest of the world could and
should learn from. Scholars have for
decades studied cultural differences in
personality
type,
especially
between
East and West, and especially the di-
mension
of
introversion-extroversion,
the one pair of traits that psychologists,
531/929
who agree on practically nothing when
it comes to cataloging human personal-
ity, believe is salient and measurable all
over the world.
Much of this research yields the same
results as McCrae’s map. One study
comparing eight- to ten-year-old chil-
dren in Shanghai and southern Ontario,
Canada, for example, found that shy
and sensitive children are shunned by
their peers in Canada but make sought-
after playmates in China, where they
are also more likely than other children
to be considered for leadership roles.
Chinese children who are sensitive and
reticent are said to be dongshi (under-
standing), a common term of praise.
Similarly, Chinese high school stu-
dents tell researchers that they prefer
friends who are “humble” and “altruist-
ic,” “honest” and “hardworking,” while
American high school students seek out
532/929
the “cheerful,” “enthusiastic,” and “so-
ciable.”
“The
contrast
is
striking,”
writes Michael Harris Bond, a cross-cul-
tural psychologist who focuses on Ch-
ina. “The Americans emphasize sociab-
ility and prize those attributes that
make for easy, cheerful association. The
Chinese emphasize deeper attributes,
focusing
on
moral
virtues
and
achievement.”
Another study asked Asian-Americans
and European-Americans to think out
loud while solving reasoning problems,
and found that the Asians did much
better when they were allowed to be
quiet, compared to the Caucasians, who
performed well when vocalizing their
problem-solving.
These results would not surprise any-
one familiar with traditional Asian atti-
tudes to the spoken word: talk is for
communicating
need-to-know
533/929
information;
quiet
and
introspection
are signs of deep thought and higher
truth. Words are potentially dangerous
weapons that reveal things better left
unsaid. They hurt other people; they
can get their speaker into trouble. Con-
sider, for example, these proverbs from
the East:
The wind howls, but the mountain re-
mains still.
—JAPANESE PROVERB
Those who know do not speak.
Those who speak do not know.
—LAO ZI, The Way of Lao Zi
Even though I make no special attempt
to observe the discipline of silence, liv-
ing alone automatically makes me re-
frain from the sins of speech.
534/929
—KAMO NO CHOMEI, 12th Century Japanese
recluse
And compare them to proverbs from
the West:
Be a craftsman in speech that thou
mayest be strong, for the strength of
one is the tongue, and speech is mighti-
er than all fighting.
—MAXIMS OF PTAHHOTEP, 2400 B.C.E.
Speech is civilization itself. The word,
even the most contradictory word, pre-
serves
contact—it
is
silence
which
isolates.
—THOMAS MANN, The Magic Mountain
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
What lies behind these starkly differ-
ent
attitudes?
One
answer
is
the
535/929
widespread
reverence
for
education
among Asians, particularly those from
“Confucian belt” countries like China,
Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. To this
day,
some
Chinese
villages
display
statues
of students
who passed the
grueling Ming dynasty–era jinshi exam
hundreds of years ago. It’s a lot easier
to
achieve
that
kind
of
distinction
if—like some of the kids from Cuper-
tino—you
spend
your
summers
studying.
Another explanation is group iden-
tity. Many Asian cultures are team-ori-
ented, but not in the way that Western-
ers think of teams. Individuals in Asia
see themselves as part of a greater
whole—whether family, corporation, or
community—and
place
tremendous
value on harmony within their group.
They
often
subordinate
their
own
536/929
desires to the group’s interests, accept-
ing their place in its hierarchy.
Western culture, by contrast, is or-
ganized around the individual. We see
ourselves as self-contained units; our
destiny is to express ourselves, to fol-
low our bliss, to be free of undue re-
straint, to achieve the one thing that
we, and we alone, were brought into
this world to do. We may be gregari-
ous, but we don’t submit to group will,
or at least we don’t like to think we do.
We love and respect our parents, but
bridle at notions like filial piety, with
their implications of subordination and
restraint. When we get together with
others, we do so as self-contained units
having
fun
with,
competing
with,
standing out from, jockeying for posi-
tion with, and, yes, loving, other self-
contained units. Even the Western God
is assertive, vocal, and dominant; his
537/929
son Jesus is kind and tender, but also a
charismatic, crowd-pleasing man of in-
fluence (Jesus Christ Superstar).
It makes sense, then, that Westerners
value boldness and verbal skill, traits
that promote individuality, while Asi-
ans prize quiet, humility, and sensitiv-
ity, which foster group cohesion. If you
live in a collective, then things will go a
lot more smoothly if you behave with
restraint, even submission.
This preference was vividly demon-
strated in a recent fMRI study in which
researchers showed seventeen Americ-
ans and seventeen Japanese pictures of
men in dominance poses (arms crossed,
muscles bulging, legs planted squarely
on the ground) and subordinate posi-
tions (shoulders bent, hands interlocked
protectively over groin, legs squeezed
together tight). They found that the
dominant pictures activated pleasure
538/929
centers in the American brains, while
the submissive pictures did the same
for the Japanese.
From a Western perspective, it can be
hard to see what’s so attractive about
submitting to the will of others. But
what looks to a Westerner like subor-
dination can seem like basic politeness
to many Asians. Don Chen, the Chinese-
American Harvard Business School stu-
dent you met in chapter 2, told me
about the time he shared an apartment
with a group of Asian friends plus his
close Caucasian friend, a gentle, easy-
going guy Don felt would fit right in.
Conflicts arose when the Caucasian
friend noticed dishes piling up in the
sink and asked his Asian roommates to
do their fair share of the washing up. It
wasn’t an unreasonable complaint, says
Don, and his friend thought he phrased
his request politely and respectfully.
539/929
But his Asian roommates saw it differ-
ently. To them, he came across as harsh
and angry. An Asian in that situation,
said Don, would be more careful with
his tone of voice. He would phrase his
displeasure in the form of a question,
not a request or command. Or he might
not bring it up at all. It wouldn’t be
worth upsetting the group over a few
dirty dishes.
What looks to Westerners like Asian
deference, in other words, is actually a
deeply felt concern for the sensibilities
of others. As the psychologist Harris
Bond observes, “It is only those from an
explicit tradition who would label [the
Asian] mode of discourse ‘self-efface-
ment.’ Within this indirect tradition it
might be labeled ‘relationship honour-
ing.’ ” And relationship honoring leads
to social dynamics that can seem re-
markable from a Western perspective.
540/929
It’s because of relationship honoring,
for example, that social anxiety dis-
order in Japan, known as taijin kyo-
fusho, takes the form not of excessive
worry about embarrassing oneself, as it
does in the United States, but of embar-
rassing
others.
It’s
because
of
relationship-honoring
that
Tibetan
Buddhist monks find inner peace (and
off-the-chart happiness levels, as meas-
ured in brain scans)
by meditating
quietly on compassion. And it’s because
of relationship-honoring that Hiroshima
victims apologized to each other for
surviving. “Their civility has been well
documented but still stays the heart,”
writes the essayist Lydia Millet. “ ‘I am
sorry,’ said one of them, bowing, with
the skin of his arms peeling off in
strips. ‘I regret I am still alive while
your baby is not.’ ‘I am sorry,’ another
said earnestly, with lips swollen to the
541/929
size of oranges, as he spoke to a child
weeping beside her dead mother. ‘I am
so sorry that I was not taken instead.’ ”
Though Eastern relationship-honor-
ing is admirable and beautiful, so is
Western respect for individual freedom,
self-expression, and personal destiny.
The point is not that one is superior to
the other, but that a profound differ-
ence in cultural values has a powerful
impact on the personality styles favored
by each culture. In the West, we sub-
scribe to the Extrovert Ideal, while in
much
of
Asia
(at
least
before
the
Westernization of the past several dec-
ades), silence is golden. These contrast-
ing outlooks affect the things we say
when our roommates’ dishes pile up in
the sink—and the things we don’t say
in a university classroom.
Moreover, they tell us that the Extro-
vert Ideal is not as sacrosanct as we
542/929
may have thought. So if, deep down,
you’ve been thinking that it’s only nat-
ural for the bold and sociable to domin-
ate the reserved and sensitive, and that
the Extrovert Ideal is innate to human-
ity, Robert McCrae’s personality map
suggests a different truth: that each
way
of
being—quiet
and
talkative,
careful and audacious, inhibited and
unrestrained—is
characteristic
of
its
own mighty civilization.
Ironically, some of the people who have
the most trouble holding on to this
truth are Asian-American kids from Cu-
pertino. Once they emerge from adoles-
cence and leave the confines of their
hometown, they find a world in which
loudness
and
speaking
out
are
the
543/929
tickets to popularity and financial suc-
cess. They come to live with a double-
consciousness—part
Asian
and
part
American—with each side calling the
other into question. Mike Wei, the high
school senior who told me he’d rather
study than socialize, is a perfect ex-
ample of this ambivalence. When we
first met, he was a high school senior,
still nestled in the Cupertino cocoon.
“Because we put so much emphasis on
education,” Mike told me then, refer-
ring to Asians in general, “socializing is
not a big part of our selves.”
When I caught up with Mike the fol-
lowing autumn, in his freshman year at
Stanford, only a twenty-minute drive
from
Cupertino
but
a
world
away
demographically, he seemed unsettled.
We met at an outdoor café, where we
sat next to a coed group of athletes
erupting regularly in laughter. Mike
544/929
nodded at the athletes, all of whom
were white. Caucasians, he said, seem
to be “less afraid of other people think-
ing that what they said was too loud or
too stupid.” Mike was frustrated by the
superficiality of dining-hall conversa-
tion, and by the “bullshitting” that of-
ten substituted for class participation in
freshman seminars. He was spending
his free time mostly with other Asians,
partly because they had “the same level
of outgoingness” he did. The non-Asi-
ans tended to make him feel as if he
had to “be really hyped up or excited,
even though that might not be true to
who I am.”
“My dorm has four Asians in it, out
of fifty kids,” he told me. “So I feel
more comfortable around them. There’s
this one guy called Brian, and he’s
pretty quiet. I can tell he has that Asian
quality where you’re kind of shy, and I
545/929
feel comfortable around him for that
reason. I feel like I can be myself
around
him.
I
don’t
have
to
do
something just to look cool, whereas
around a big group of people that
aren’t Asian or are just really loud, I
feel like I have to play a role.”
Mike sounded dismissive of Western
communication styles, but he admitted
that he sometimes wished he could be
noisy and uninhibited himself. “They’re
more comfortable with their own char-
acter,” he said of his Caucasian class-
mates. Asians are “not uncomfortable
with who they are, but are uncomfort-
able with expressing who they are. In a
group, there’s always that pressure to
be outgoing. When they don’t live up to
it, you can see it in their faces.”
Mike
told
me
about
a
freshman
icebreaking event he’d participated in,
a scavenger hunt in San Francisco that
546/929
was supposed to encourage students to
step out of their comfort zones. Mike
was the only Asian assigned to a rowdy
group, some of whom streaked naked
down a San Francisco street and cross-
dressed in a local department store dur-
ing the hunt. One girl went to a Victor-
ia’s Secret display and stripped down to
her
underwear.
As
Mike
recounted
these details, I thought he was going to
tell me that his group had been over
the top, inappropriate. But he wasn’t
critical of the other students. He was
critical of himself.
“When people do things like that,
there’s a moment where I feel uncom-
fortable with it. It shows my own lim-
its. Sometimes I feel like they’re better
than I am.”
Mike was getting similar messages
from his professors. A few weeks after
the
orientation
event,
his
freshman
547/929
adviser—a professor at Stanford’s med-
ical school—invited a group of students
to her house. Mike hoped to make a
good impression, but he couldn’t think
of anything to say. The other students
seemed to have no problem joking
around and asking intelligent questions.
“Mike, you were so loud today,” the
professor teased him when finally he
said
good-bye.
“You
just
blew
me
away.” He left her house feeling bad
about himself. “People who don’t talk
are seen as weak or lacking,” he con-
cluded ruefully.
To be sure, these feelings were not
totally new to Mike. He’d experienced
glimmers of them back in high school.
Cupertino may have an almost Con-
fucian
ethic
of
quiet,
study,
and
relationship-honoring, but it’s subject
to the mores of the Extrovert Ideal all
the same. At the local shopping center
548/929
on a weekday afternoon, cocky Asian-
American teenage guys with spiky hair-
cuts call out to eye-rolling, wise-crack-
ing girls in spaghetti-strap tank tops.
On a Saturday morning at the library,
some teens study intently in corners,
but
others
congregate
at
boisterous
tables. Few of the Asian-American kids
I spoke to in Cupertino wanted to
identify themselves with the word intro-
vert, even if they effectively described
themselves
that
way.
While
deeply
committed to their parents’ values, they
seemed to divide the world into “tradi-
tional”
Asians
versus
“Asian
super-
stars.” The traditionals keep their heads
down and get their homework done.
The superstars do well academically
but also joke around in class, challenge
their
teachers,
and
get
themselves
noticed.
549/929
Many students deliberately try to be
more outgoing than their parents, Mike
told me. “They think their parents are
too quiet and they try to overcom-
pensate by being flauntingly outgoing.”
Some of the parents have started to
shift their values too. “Asian parents
are starting to see that it doesn’t pay to
be quiet, so they encourage their kids
to take speech and debate,” Mike said.
“Our speech and debate program was
the second largest in California, to give
kids exposure to speaking loudly and
convincingly.”
Still, when I first met Mike in Cuper-
tino, his sense of himself and his values
was pretty much intact. He knew that
he
wasn’t
one
of
the
Asian
super-
stars—he rated himself a 4 on a pop-
ularity scale of 1 to 10—but seemed
comfortable in his own skin. “I’d rather
hang
out
with
people
whose
550/929
personalities are more genuine,” he told
me then, “and that tends to lead me to-
ward more quiet people. It’s hard to be
gleeful when at the same time I’m try-
ing to be wise.”
Indeed, Mike was probably lucky to
enjoy the Cupertino cocoon for as long
as he did. Asian-American kids who
grow up in more typical American com-
munities often face the issues that Mike
confronted
as
a
Stanford
freshman
much earlier in their lives. One study
comparing
European-American
and
second-generation
Chinese-American
teens over a five-year period found that
the Chinese-Americans were signific-
antly more introverted than their Amer-
ican
peers
throughout
adoles-
cence—and paid the price with their
self-esteem. While introverted Chinese-
American twelve-year-olds felt perfectly
fine
about
themselves—presumably
551/929
because they still measured themselves
according to their parents’ traditional
value systems—by the time they got to
be seventeen and had been more ex-
posed
to
America’s
Extrovert
Ideal,
their self-regard had taken a nosedive.
For Asian-American kids, the cost of
failing to fit in is social unease. But as
they grow up, they may pay the price
with their paychecks. The journalist
Nicholas Lemann once interviewed a
group of Asian-Americans on the sub-
ject of meritocracy for his book The Big
Test. “A sentiment that emerges consist-
ently,” he wrote, “is that meritocracy
ends on graduation day, and that after-
ward, Asians start to fall behind be-
cause they don’t have quite the right
552/929
cultural style for getting ahead: too
passive,
not
hail-fellow-well-met
enough.”
I met many professionals in Cuper-
tino who were struggling with this is-
sue. A well-heeled housewife confided
that all the husbands in her social circle
had recently accepted jobs in China,
and were now commuting between Cu-
pertino and Shanghai, partly because
their quiet styles prevented them from
advancing locally. The American com-
panies “think they can’t handle busi-
ness,” she said, “because of presenta-
tion. In business, you have to put a lot
of nonsense together and present it. My
husband always just makes his point
and that’s the end of it. When you look
at big companies, almost none of the
top executives are Asians. They hire
someone who doesn’t know anything
553/929
about the business, but maybe he can
make a good presentation.”
A software engineer told me how
overlooked he felt at work in comparis-
on to other people, “especially people
from
European
origin,
who
speak
without thinking.” In China, he said, “If
you’re quiet, you’re seen as being wise.
It’s
completely
different
here.
Here
people like to speak out. Even if they
have an idea, not completely mature
yet, people still speak out. If I could be
better
in
communication,
my
work
would be much more recognized. Even
though my manager appreciates me, he
still doesn’t know I have done work so
wonderful.”
The engineer then confided that he
had sought training in American-style
extroversion
from
a
Taiwanese-born
communications professor named Pre-
ston Ni. At Foothill College, just outside
554/929
Cupertino, Ni conducts daylong sem-
inars called “Communication Success
for
Foreign-Born
Professionals.”
The
class is advertised online through a loc-
al
group
called
the
Silicon
Valley
SpeakUp Association, whose mission is
to “help foreign-born professionals to
succeed in life through enhancement in
soft skills.” (“Speak you [sic] mind!”
reads the organization’s home page.
“Together everyone achieve [sic] more
at SVSpeakup.”)
Curious about what speaking one’s
mind looks like from an Asian perspect-
ive, I signed up for the class and, a few
Saturday mornings later, found myself
sitting at a desk in a starkly modern
classroom,
the
Northern
California
mountain sun streaming through its
plate-glass windows. There were about
fifteen students in all, many from Asian
555/929
countries
but
some
from
Eastern
Europe and South America, too.
Professor Ni, a friendly-looking man
wearing a Western-style suit, a gold-
colored tie with a Chinese drawing of a
waterfall, and a shy smile, began the
class with an overview of American
business culture. In the United States,
he warned, you need style as well as
substance if you want to get ahead. It
may not be fair, and it might not be the
best way of judging a person’s contribu-
tion to the bottom line, “but if you
don’t have charisma you can be the
most brilliant person in the world and
you’ll still be disrespected.”
This is different from many other cul-
tures, said Ni. When a Chinese Com-
munist leader makes a speech, he reads
it, not even from a teleprompter but
from a paper. “If he’s the leader, every-
one has to listen.”
556/929
Ni asked for volunteers and brought
Raj, a twentysomething Indian software
engineer at a Fortune 500 company, to
the front of the room. Raj was dressed
in the Silicon Valley uniform of casual
button-down shirt and chinos, but his
body language was defensive. He stood
with his arms crossed protectively over
his chest, scuffing at the ground with
his hiking boots. Earlier that morning,
when we’d gone around the room intro-
ducing ourselves, he’d told us, in a
tremulous voice from his seat in the
back row, that he wanted to learn “how
to make more conversation” and “to be
more open.”
Professor Ni asked Raj to tell the
class about his plans for the rest of the
weekend.
“I’m going to dinner with a friend,”
replied Raj, looking fixedly at Ni, his
557/929
voice barely audible, “and then perhaps
tomorrow I’ll go hiking.”
Professor Ni asked him to try it
again.
“I’m going to dinner with a friend,”
said Raj, “and then, mumble, mumble,
mumble, I’ll go hiking.”
“My impression of you,” Professor Ni
told Raj gently, “is that I can give you a
lot of work to do, but I don’t have to
pay much attention to you. Remember,
in
Silicon
Valley,
you
can
be
the
smartest, most capable person, but if
you can’t express yourself aside from
showing your work, you’ll be underap-
preciated. Many foreign-born profes-
sionals experience this; you’re a glori-
fied laborer instead of a leader.”
The class nodded sympathetically.
“But there’s a way to be yourself,”
continued Ni, “and to let more of you
come out through your voice. Many
558/929
Asians use only a narrow set of muscles
when they speak. So we’ll start with
breathing.”
With that, he directed Raj to lie on
his back and vocalize the five American
English vowels. “A … E … U … O …
I …” intoned Raj, his voice floating up
from the classroom floor. “A … E …
U … O … I … A … E … U … O … I …”
Finally
Professor
Ni
deemed
Raj
ready to stand up again.
“Now, what interesting things do you
have planned for after class?” he asked,
clapping his hands encouragingly.
“Tonight I’m going to a friend’s place
for dinner, and tomorrow I’m going
hiking with another friend.” Raj’s voice
was louder than before, and the class
applauded with gusto.
The professor himself is a role model
for what can happen when you work at
it. After class, I visited him in his office,
559/929
and he told me how shy he’d been
when
he
first
came
to
the
United
States—how he put himself in situ-
ations, like summer camp and business
school, where he could practice acting
extroverted until it came more natur-
ally. These days he has a successful
consulting practice, with clients that in-
clude
Yahoo!,
Visa,
and
Microsoft,
teaching some of the same skills he
labored to acquire himself.
But when we began talking about
Asian concepts of “soft power”—what
Ni calls leadership “by water rather
than by fire”—I started to see a side of
him that was less impressed by Western
styles of communication. “In Asian cul-
tures,” Ni said, “there’s often a subtle
way to get what you want. It’s not al-
ways aggressive, but it can be very de-
termined and very skillful. In the end,
much
is
achieved
because
of
it.
560/929
Aggressive power beats you up; soft
power wins you over.”
I asked the professor for real-life ex-
amples of soft power, and his eyes
shone as he told me of clients whose
strength lay in their ideas and heart.
Many of these people were organizers
of employee groups—women’s groups,
diversity groups—who had managed to
rally people to their cause through con-
viction rather than dynamism. He also
talked
about
groups
like
Mothers
Against
Drunk
Driving—clusters
of
people who change lives through the
power not of their charisma but of their
caring. Their communication skills are
sufficient to convey their message, but
their
real
strength
comes
from
substance.
“In the long run,” said Ni, “if the idea
is good, people shift. If the cause is just
and you put heart into it, it’s almost a
561/929
universal law: you will attract people
who want to share your cause. Soft
power is quiet persistence. The people
I’m thinking of are very persistent in
their day-to-day, person-to-person in-
teractions. Eventually they build up a
team.” Soft power, said Ni, was wielded
by people we’ve admired throughout
history: Mother Teresa, the Buddha,
Gandhi.
I was struck when Ni mentioned
Gandhi. I had asked almost all the Cu-
pertino high school students I met to
name a leader they admired, and many
had named Gandhi. What was it about
him that inspired them so?
Gandhi was, according to his autobio-
graphy, a constitutionally shy and quiet
562/929
man. As a child, he was afraid of
everything: thieves, ghosts, snakes, the
dark, and especially other people. He
buried himself in books and ran home
from school as soon as it was over, for
fear of having to talk to anybody. Even
as a young man, when he was elected
to his first leadership position as a
member of the Executive Committee of
the Vegetarian
Society,
he attended
every meeting, but was too shy to
speak.
“You talk to me quite all right,” one
of the members asked him, confused,
“but why is it that you never open your
lips at a committee meeting? You are a
drone.” When a political struggle oc-
curred on the committee, Gandhi had
firm opinions, but was too scared to
voice
them.
He
wrote
his
thoughts
down, intending to read them aloud at
563/929
a meeting. But in the end he was too
cowed even to do that.
Gandhi learned over time to manage
his shyness, but he never really over-
came it. He couldn’t speak extemporan-
eously; he avoided making speeches
whenever possible. Even in his later
years, he wrote, “I do not think I could
or would even be inclined to keep a
meeting of friends engaged in talk.”
But with his shyness came his unique
brand of strength—a form of restraint
best
understood
by
examining
little
known corners of Gandhi’s life story. As
a young man he decided to travel to
England
to
study
law,
against
the
wishes of the leaders of his Modhi
Bania subcaste. Caste members were
forbidden to eat meat, and the leaders
believed that vegetarianism was im-
possible in England. But Gandhi had
already vowed to his beloved mother to
564/929
abstain from meat, so he saw no danger
in the trip. He said as much to the
Sheth, the headman of the community.
“Will you disregard the orders of the
caste?” demanded the Sheth.
“I
am
really
helpless,”
replied
Gandhi. “I think the caste should not
interfere in the matter.”
Boom! He was excommunicated—a
judgment that remained in force even
when he returned from England several
years later with the promise of success
that attended a young, English-speaking
lawyer. The community was divided
over how to handle him. One camp em-
braced him; the other cast him out.
This meant that Gandhi was not al-
lowed even to eat or drink at the homes
of fellow subcaste members, including
his own sister and his mother- and
father-in-law.
565/929
Another man, Gandhi knew, would
protest for readmission. But he couldn’t
see the point. He knew that fighting
would only generate retaliation. Instead
he followed the Sheth’s wishes and kept
at a distance, even from his own family.
His sister and in-laws were prepared to
host him at their homes in secret, but
he turned them down.
The result of this compliance? The
subcaste not only stopped bothering
him, but its members—including those
who had excommunicated him—helped
in his later political work, without ex-
pecting
anything
in
return.
They
treated him with affection and generos-
ity. “It is my conviction,” Gandhi wrote
later, “that all these good things are
due to my non-resistance. Had I agit-
ated for being admitted to the caste,
had I attempted to divide it into more
camps, had I provoked the castemen,
566/929
they would surely have retaliated, and
instead of steering clear of the storm, I
should, on arrival from England, have
found
myself
in
a
whirlpool
of
agitation.”
This pattern—the decision to accept
what
another
man
would
chal-
lenge—occurred
again
and
again
in
Gandhi’s life. As a young lawyer in
South Africa, he applied for admission
to the local bar. The Law Society didn’t
want Indian members, and tried to
thwart his application by requiring an
original copy of a certificate that was
on file in the Bombay High Court and
therefore inaccessible. Gandhi was en-
raged; he knew well that the true reas-
on for these barriers was discrimina-
tion. But he didn’t let his feelings show.
Instead he negotiated patiently, until
the Law Society agreed to accept an af-
fidavit from a local dignitary.
567/929
The day arrived when he stood to
take the oath, at which point the chief
justice ordered him to take off his
turban. Gandhi saw his true limitations
then. He knew that resistance would be
justified, but believed in picking his
battles, so he took off his headgear. His
friends were upset. They said he was
weak, that he should have stood up for
his beliefs. But Gandhi felt that he had
learned “to appreciate the beauty of
compromise.”
If I told you these stories without
mentioning Gandhi’s name and later
achievements, you might view him as a
deeply passive man. And in the West,
passivity is a transgression. To be “pass-
ive,” according to the Merriam-Webster
Dictionary, means to be “acted upon by
an external agency.” It also means to be
“submissive.”
Gandhi
himself
ulti-
mately
rejected
the
phrase
“passive
568/929
resistance,” which he associated with
weakness,
preferring
satyagraha,
the
term he coined to mean “firmness in
pursuit of truth.”
But as the word satyagraha implies,
Gandhi’s passivity was not weakness at
all. It meant focusing on an ultimate
goal and refusing to divert energy to
unnecessary skirmishes along the way.
Restraint, Gandhi believed, was one of
his greatest assets. And it was born of
his shyness:
I have naturally formed the habit of
restraining my thoughts. A thought-
less word hardly ever escaped my
tongue
or
pen.
Experience
has
taught me that silence is part of the
spiritual discipline of a votary of
truth. We find so many people impa-
tient to talk. All this talking can
hardly be said to be of any benefit
569/929
to the world. It is so much waste of
time. My shyness has been in reality
my shield and buckler. It has al-
lowed me to grow. It has helped me
in my discernment of truth.
Soft power is not limited to moral ex-
emplars like Mahatma Gandhi. Con-
sider,
for
example,
the
much-bally-
hooed excellence of Asians in fields like
math and science. Professor Ni defines
soft power as “quiet persistence,” and
this trait lies at the heart of academic
excellence
as
surely
as
it
does
in
Gandhi’s political triumphs. Quiet per-
sistence
requires
sustained
atten-
tion—in effect restraining one’s reac-
tions to external stimuli.

The TIMSS exam (Trends in Interna-
tional Mathematics and Science Study)
is a standardized math and science test
given every four years to kids around
the world. After each test, researchers
slice and dice the results, comparing
the performance of students from dif-
ferent countries; Asian countries such
as Korea, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan
consistently rank at the top of the list.
In 1995, for example, the first year the
TIMSS was given, Korea, Singapore,
and
Japan
had
the
world’s
highest
average middle-school math scores and
were among the top four worldwide in
science.
In
2007,
when
researchers
measured how many students in a giv-
en country reached the Advanced Inter-
national Benchmark—a kind of super-
star
status
for
math
students—they
found that most of the standouts were
clustered in just a few Asian countries.
571/929
About 40 percent of fourth graders in
Singapore and Hong Kong reached or
surpassed
the
Advanced
Benchmark,
and about 40 to 45 percent of eighth
graders in Taiwan, Korea, and Singa-
pore pulled it off. Worldwide, the medi-
an percentage of students reaching the
Advanced Benchmark was only 5 per-
cent at the fourth grade and 2 percent
at the eighth grade.
How to explain these sensational per-
formance gaps between Asia and the
rest of the world? Consider this inter-
esting wrinkle in the TIMSS exam. Stu-
dents taking the test are also asked to
answer a tedious series of questions
about themselves, ranging from how
much they enjoy science to whether
there are enough books in their home
to fill three or more bookcases. The
questionnaire takes a long time to com-
plete, and since it doesn’t count toward
572/929
the final grade, many students leave a
lot of questions blank. You’d have to be
pretty persistent to answer every single
one. But it turns out, according to a
study
by
education
professor
Erling
Boe, that the nations whose students fill
out more of the questionnaire also tend
to have students who do well on the
TIMSS test. In other words, excellent
students seem not only to possess the
cognitive ability to solve math and sci-
ence problems, but also to have a useful
personality
characteristic:
quiet
persistence.
Other studies have also found unusu-
al levels of persistence in even very
young Asian children. For example, the
cross-cultural
psychologist
Priscilla
Blinco gave Japanese and American
first graders an unsolvable puzzle to
work on in solitude, without the help of
other
children
or
a
teacher,
and
573/929
compared how long they tried before
giving up. The Japanese children spent
an average of 13.93 minutes on the
puzzle before calling it quits, whereas
the
American
kids
spent
only
9.47
minutes. Fewer than 27 percent of the
American students persisted as long as
the
average
Japanese
student—and
only 10 percent of the Japanese stu-
dents gave up as quickly as the average
American. Blinco attributes these res-
ults
to
the
Japanese
quality
of
persistence.
The quiet persistence shown by many
Asians, and Asian-Americans,
is not
limited to the fields of math and sci-
ence. Several years after my first trip to
Cupertino, I caught up with Tiffany
Liao,
the
Swarthmore-bound
high
school
student
whose
parents
had
praised her so highly for loving to read,
even in public, when she was a young
574/929
girl. When we first met, Tiffany was a
baby-faced seventeen-year-old on her
way to college. She told me then that
she was excited to travel to the East
Coast and meet new people, but was
also afraid of living in a place where no
one else would drink bubble tea, the
popular drink invented in Taiwan.
Now Tiffany was a worldly and soph-
isticated college senior. She had studied
abroad in Spain. She signed her notes
with
a
continental
touch:
“Abrazos,
Tiffany.” In her Facebook picture, the
childlike look was gone, replaced with
a smile that was still soft and friendly
but also knowing.
Tiffany was on her way to realizing
her dream of becoming a journalist,
having just been elected editor-in-chief
of the college newspaper. She still de-
scribed herself as shy—she feels a heat
rush on her face when she first speaks
575/929
in public or picks up the phone to call a
stranger—but had become more com-
fortable speaking up. She believed that
her “quiet traits,” as she called them,
had helped her become editor-in-chief.
For Tiffany, soft power meant listening
attentively, taking thorough notes, and
doing deep research on her interview
subjects before meeting them face-to-
face. “This process has contributed to
my success as a journalist,” she wrote
to me. Tiffany had come to embrace the
power of quiet.
When I first met Mike Wei, the Stanford
student who wished he was as uninhib-
ited as his classmates, he said that there
was no such thing as a quiet leader.
“How can you let people know you
576/929
have conviction if you’re quiet about
it?” he asked. I reassured him that this
wasn’t so, but Mike had so much quiet
conviction about the inability of quiet
people to convey conviction that deep
down I’d wondered whether he had a
point.
But that was before I heard Professor
Ni talk about Asian-style soft power,
before I read Gandhi on satyagraha, be-
fore I contemplated Tiffany’s bright fu-
ture as a journalist. Conviction is con-
viction, the kids from Cupertino taught
me,
at
whatever
decibel
level
it’s
expressed.

WHEN SHOULD YOU ACT MORE
EXTROVERTED THAN YOU REALLY
ARE?
A man has as many social selves as there
are distinct groups of persons about
whose opinion he cares. He generally
shows a different side of himself to each
of these different groups.
—WILLIAM JAMES
Meet Professor Brian Little, former Har-
vard University psychology lecturer and
winner of the 3M Teaching Fellowship,
sometimes referred to as the Nobel Pr-
ize of university teaching. Short, sturdy,
bespectacled, and endearing, Professor
Little has a booming baritone, a habit
of
breaking
into
song
and
twirling
about onstage, and an old-school act-
or’s way of emphasizing consonants
and elongating vowels. He’s been de-
scribed as a cross between Robin Willi-
ams and Albert Einstein, and when he
makes a joke that pleases his audience,
which happens a lot, he looks even
more
delighted
than
they
do.
His
classes at Harvard were always over-
subscribed and often ended with stand-
ing ovations.
In contrast, the man I’m about to de-
scribe seems a very different breed: he
lives with his wife in a tucked-away
house on more than two acres of re-
mote Canadian woods, visited occasion-
ally by his children and grandchildren,
but otherwise keeping to himself. He
spends his free time scoring music,
reading and writing books and articles,
580/929
and e-mailing friends long notes he
calls “e-pistles.” When he does social-
ize, he favors one-on-one encounters.
At parties, he pairs off into quiet con-
versations as soon as he can or excuses
himself “for a breath of fresh air.”
When he’s forced to spend too much
time out and about or in any situation
involving conflict, he can literally be-
come ill.
Would you be surprised if I told you
that the vaudevillean professor and the
recluse who prefers a life of the mind
are one and the same man? Maybe not,
when you consider that we all behave
differently depending on the situation.
But if we’re capable of such flexibility,
does it even make sense to chart the
differences between introverts and ex-
troverts?
Is
the
very
notion
of
introversion-extroversion too pat a di-
chotomy:
the
introvert
as
sage
581/929
philosopher, the extrovert as fearless
leader? The introvert as poet or science
nerd, the extrovert as jock or cheerlead-
er? Aren’t we all a little of both?
Psychologists call this the “person-
situation” debate: Do fixed personality
traits really exist, or do they shift ac-
cording
to
the
situation
in
which
people find themselves? If you talk to
Professor Little, he’ll tell you that des-
pite his public persona and his teaching
accolades, he’s a true blue, off-the-
charts introvert, not only behaviorally
but also neurophysiologically (he took
the lemon juice test I described in
chapter 4 and salivated right on cue).
This would seem to place him squarely
on the “person” side of the debate:
Little believes that personality traits ex-
ist, that they shape our lives in pro-
found
ways,
that
they’re
based
on
physiological
mechanisms,
and
that
582/929
they’re
relatively
stable
across
a
lifespan. Those who take this view
stand on broad shoulders: Hippocrates,
Milton, Schopenhauer, Jung, and more
recently the prophets of fMRI machines
and skin conductance tests.
On the other side of the debate are a
group of psychologists known as the
Situationists. Situationism posits that
our generalizations about people, in-
cluding the words we use to describe
one another—shy, aggressive, conscien-
tious, agreeable—are misleading. There
is no core self; there are only the vari-
ous selves of Situations X, Y, and Z. The
Situationist view rose to prominence in
1968
when
the
psychologist
Walter
Mischel
published
Personality
and
Assessment,
challenging
the
idea
of
fixed personality traits. Mischel argued
that
situational
factors
predict
the
583/929
behavior of people like Brian Little
much better than supposed personality
traits.
For the next few decades, Situation-
ism prevailed. The postmodern view of
self that emerged around this time, in-
fluenced by theorists like Erving Goff-
man, author of The Presentation of Self
in Everyday Life, suggested that social
life is performance and social masks are
our
true
selves.
Many
researchers
doubted whether personality traits even
existed in any meaningful sense. Per-
sonality researchers had trouble finding
jobs.
But just as the nature-nurture debate
was replaced with interactionism—the
insight that both factors contribute to
who we are, and indeed influence each
other—so has the person-situation de-
bate been superseded by a more nu-
anced
understanding.
Personality
584/929
psychologists acknowledge that we can
feel sociable at 6:00 p.m. and solitary
at 10:00 p.m., and that these fluctu-
ations are real and situation-dependent.
But they also emphasize how much
evidence has emerged to support the
premise
that
notwithstanding
these
variations, there truly is such a thing as
a fixed personality.
These days, even Mischel admits that
personality traits exist, but he believes
they tend to occur in patterns. For ex-
ample, some people are aggressive with
peers and subordinates but docile with
authority figures; others are just the op-
posite. People who are “rejection-sens-
itive” are warm and loving when they
feel
secure,
hostile
and
controlling
when they feel rejected.
But
this
comfortable
compromise
raises a variation on the problem of
free will that we explored in chapter 5.
585/929
We know that there are physiological
limits on who we are and how we act.
But should we attempt to manipulate
our behavior within the range available
to us, or should we simply be true to
ourselves? At what point does con-
trolling our behavior become futile, or
exhausting?
If you’re an introvert in corporate
America, should you try to save your
true self for quiet weekends and spend
your weekdays striving to “get out
there, mix, speak more often, and con-
nect with your team and others, de-
ploying all the energy and personality
you can muster,” as Jack Welch advised
in a BusinessWeek online column? If
you’re an extroverted university stu-
dent, should you save your true self for
rowdy weekends and spend your week-
days focusing and studying? Can people
586/929
fine-tune their own personalities this
way?
The only good answer I’ve heard to
these questions comes from Professor
Brian Little.
On the morning of October 12, 1979,
Little visited the Royal Military College
Saint-Jean on the Richelieu River, forty
kilometers south of Montreal, to ad-
dress a group of senior military officers.
As an introvert might be expected to
do, he’d prepared thoroughly for the
speech, not only rehearsing his remarks
but also making sure he could cite the
latest research. Even while delivering
his talk, he was in what he calls classic
introvert mode, continually scanning
the room for audience displeasure and
587/929
making adjustments as needed—a stat-
istical reference here, a dollop of hu-
mor there.
The speech was a success (so much
so that he would be invited to make it
every year). But the next invitation the
college extended horrified him: to join
the top brass for lunch. Little had to de-
liver another lecture that afternoon,
and he knew that making small talk for
an hour and a half would wipe him out.
He needed to recharge for his afternoon
performance.
Thinking quickly, he announced that
he had a passion for ship design and
asked his hosts if he might instead take
the opportunity of his visit to admire
the boats passing by on the Richelieu
River. He then spent his lunch hour
strolling up and down the river path-
way with an appreciative expression on
his face.
588/929
For years Little returned to lecture at
the college, and for years, at lunchtime,
he walked the banks of the Richelieu
River
indulging
his
imaginary
hobby—until
the
day
the
college
moved its campus to a landlocked loca-
tion. Stripped of his cover story, Pro-
fessor Little resorted to the only escape
hatch he could find—the men’s room.
After each lecture, he would race to the
restroom and hide inside a stall. One
time, a military man spotted Little’s
shoes under the door and began a
hearty conversation, so Little took to
keeping his feet propped up on the
bathroom walls, where they would be
hidden from view. (Taking shelter in
bathrooms is a surprisingly common
phenomenon, as you probably know if
you’re an introvert. “After a talk, I’m in
bathroom
stall
number
nine,”
Little
once
told
Peter
Gzowski,
one
of
589/929
Canada’s most eminent talk-show hosts.
“After a show, I’m in stall number
eight,” replied Gzowski, not missing a
beat.)
You might wonder how a strong in-
trovert like Professor Little manages to
speak in public so effectively. The an-
swer, he says, is simple, and it has to
do with a new field of psychology that
he
created
almost
singlehandedly,
called Free Trait Theory. Little believes
that fixed traits and free traits coexist.
According to Free Trait Theory, we are
born and culturally endowed with cer-
tain personality traits—introversion, for
example—but we can and do act out of
character in the service of “core person-
al projects.”
In other words, introverts are capable
of acting like extroverts for the sake of
work they consider important, people
they
love,
or
anything
they
value
590/929
highly. Free Trait Theory explains why
an introvert might throw his extrover-
ted wife a surprise party or join the
PTA at his daughter’s school. It explains
how it’s possible for an extroverted sci-
entist to behave with reserve in her
laboratory, for an agreeable person to
act hard-nosed during a business nego-
tiation, and for a cantankerous uncle to
treat his niece tenderly when he takes
her out for ice cream. As these ex-
amples suggest, Free Trait Theory ap-
plies in many different contexts, but it’s
especially relevant for introverts living
under the Extrovert Ideal.
According to Little, our lives are dra-
matically
enhanced
when
we’re
in-
volved in core personal projects that we
consider meaningful, manageable, and
not unduly stressful, and that are sup-
ported by others. When someone asks
us “How are things?” we may give a
591/929
throwaway answer, but our true re-
sponse is a function of how well our
core personal projects are going.
That’s why Professor Little, the con-
summate introvert, lectures with such
passion. Like a modern-day Socrates, he
loves his students deeply; opening their
minds and attending to their well-being
are two of his core personal projects.
When Little held office hours at Har-
vard, the students lined up in the hall-
way as if he were giving out free tickets
to a rock concert. For more than twenty
years his students asked him to write
several hundred letters of recommenda-
tion a year. “Brian Little is the most en-
gaging, entertaining, and caring pro-
fessor I have ever encountered,” wrote
one student about him. “I cannot even
begin to explain the myriad ways in
which he has positively affected my
life.” So, for Brian Little, the additional
592/929
effort required to stretch his natural
boundaries is justified by seeing his
core personal project—igniting all those
minds—come to fruition.
At
first
blush,
Free
Trait
Theory
seems to run counter to a cherished
piece
of
our
cultural
heritage.
Shakespeare’s oft-quoted advice, “To
thine own self be true,” runs deep in
our philosophical DNA. Many of us are
uncomfortable with the idea of taking
on a “false” persona for any length of
time. And if we act out of character by
convincing ourselves that our pseudo-
self is real, we can eventually burn out
without even knowing why. The genius
of Little’s theory is how neatly it re-
solves this discomfort. Yes, we are only
pretending to be extroverts, and yes,
such inauthenticity can be morally am-
biguous (not to mention exhausting),
but if it’s in the service of love or a
593/929
professional calling, then we’re doing
just as Shakespeare advised.
When people are skilled at adopting
free traits, it can be hard to believe that
they’re acting out of character. Profess-
or Little’s students are usually incredu-
lous when he claims to be an introvert.
But Little is far from unique; many
people, especially those in leadership
roles,
engage
in
a
certain
level
of
pretend-extroversion. Consider, for ex-
ample, my friend Alex, the socially ad-
ept head of a financial services com-
pany, who agreed to give a candid in-
terview on the condition of sealed-in-
blood anonymity. Alex told me that
pretend-extroversion was something he
taught himself in the seventh grade,
594/929
when he decided that other kids were
taking advantage of him.
“I was the nicest person you’d ever
want to know,” Alex recalls, “but the
world wasn’t that way. The problem
was that if you were just a nice person,
you’d get crushed. I refused to live a
life where people could do that stuff to
me. I was like, OK, what’s the policy
prescription here? And there really was
only one. I needed to have every person
in my pocket. If I wanted to be a nice
person, I needed to run the school.”
But how to get from A to B? “I stud-
ied social dynamics, I guarantee more
than anyone you’ve ever met,” Alex
told me. He observed the way people
talked, the way they walked—espe-
cially male dominance poses. He adjus-
ted his own persona, which allowed
him to go on being a fundamentally
shy, sweet kid, but without being taken
595/929
advantage of. “Any hard thing where
you can get crushed, I was like, ‘I need
to learn how to do this.’ So by now I’m
built for war. Because then people don’t
screw you.”
Alex also took advantage of his nat-
ural strengths. “I learned that boys ba-
sically do only one thing: they chase
girls. They get them, they lose them,
they talk about them. I was like, ‘That’s
completely circuitous. I really like girls.’
That’s where intimacy comes from. So
rather than sitting around and talking
about girls, I got to know them. I used
having relationships with girls, plus be-
ing good at sports, to have the guys in
my pocket. Oh, and every once in a
while, you have to punch people. I did
that, too.”
Today Alex has a folksy, affable,
whistle-while-you-work demeanor. I’ve
never seen him in a bad mood. But
596/929
you’ll see his self-taught bellicose side
if you ever try to cross him in a negoti-
ation. And you’ll see his introverted self
if you ever try to make dinner plans
with him.
“I could literally go years without
having any friends except for my wife
and kids,” he says. “Look at you and
me. You’re one of my best friends, and
how
many
times
do
we
actually
talk—when you call me! I don’t like so-
cializing. My dream is to live off the
land on a thousand acres with my fam-
ily. You never see a team of friends in
that
dream.
So
notwithstanding
whatever you might see in my public
persona, I am an introvert. I think that
fundamentally I’m the same person I al-
ways was. Massively shy, but I com-
pensate for it.”
597/929
But how many of us are really capable
of acting out of character to this degree
(putting aside, for the moment, the
question of whether we want to)? Pro-
fessor Little happens to be a great per-
former, and so are many CEOs. What
about the rest of us?
Some years ago, a research psycholo-
gist named Richard Lippa set out to an-
swer this question. He called a group of
introverts to his lab and asked them to
act like extroverts while pretending to
teach a math class. Then he and his
team, video cameras in hand, measured
the length of their strides, the amount
of eye contact they made with their
“students,” the percentage of time they
spent talking, the pace and volume of
their speech, and the total length of
598/929
each teaching session. They also rated
how generally extroverted the subjects
appeared,
based
on
their
recorded
voices and body language.
Then Lippa did the same thing with
actual extroverts and compared the res-
ults. He found that although the latter
group came across as more extroverted,
some of the pseudo-extroverts were sur-
prisingly convincing. It seems that most
of us know how to fake it to some ex-
tent. Whether or not we’re aware that
the
length
of
our
strides
and
the
amount of time we spend talking and
smiling mark us as introverts and extro-
verts, we know it unconsciously.
Still, there’s a limit to how much we
can control our self-presentation. This
is partly because of a phenomenon
called behavioral leakage, in which our
true selves seep out via unconscious
body language: a subtle look away at a
599/929
moment when an extrovert would have
made eye contact, or a skillful turn of
the conversation by a lecturer that
places the burden of talking on the
audience when an extroverted speaker
would
have
held
the
floor
a
little
longer.
How was it that some of Lippa’s
pseudo-extroverts came so close to the
scores of true extroverts? It turned out
that the introverts who were especially
good at acting like extroverts tended to
score high for a trait that psychologists
call “self-monitoring.” Self-monitors are
highly skilled at modifying their beha-
vior to the social demands of a situ-
ation. They look for cues to tell them
how to act. When in Rome, they do as
the Romans do, according to the psy-
chologist Mark Snyder, author of Public
Appearances, Private Realities, and creat-
or of the Self-Monitoring Scale.
600/929
One of the most effective self-monit-
ors I’ve ever met is a man named
Edgar, a well-known and much-beloved
fixture on the New York social circuit.
He and his wife host or attend fund-
raisers and other social events seem-
ingly every weeknight. He’s the kind of
enfant terrible whose latest antics are a
favorite
topic
of
conversation.
But
Edgar is an avowed introvert. “I’d much
rather sit and read and think about
things than talk to people,” he says.
Yet talk to people he does. Edgar was
raised in a highly social family that ex-
pected him to self-monitor, and he’s
motivated to do so. “I love politics,” he
says. “I love policy, I love making
things happen, I want to change the
world in my own way. So I do stuff
that’s artificial. I don’t really like being
the guest at someone else’s party, be-
cause then I have to be entertaining.
601/929
But I’ll host parties because it puts you
at the center of things without actually
being a social person.”
When he does find himself at other
people’s parties, Edgar goes to great
lengths to play his role. “All through
college, and recently even, before I ever
went to a dinner or cocktail party, I
would have an index card with three to
five relevant, amusing anecdotes. I’d
come up with them during the day—if
something struck me I’d jot it down.
Then, at dinner, I’d wait for the right
opening and launch in. Sometimes I’d
have to go to the bathroom and pull
out my cards to remember what my
little stories were.”
Over time, though, Edgar stopped
bringing index cards to dinner parties.
He still considers himself an introvert,
but he grew so deeply into his extrover-
ted role that telling anecdotes started to
602/929
come naturally to him. Indeed, the
highest self-monitors not only tend to
be good at producing the desired effect
and emotion in a given social situ-
ation—they also experience less stress
while doing so.
In
contrast
to
the
Edgars
of
the
world, low self-monitors base their be-
havior on their own internal compass.
They have a smaller repertoire of social
behaviors and masks at their disposal.
They’re
less
sensitive
to
situational
cues, like how many anecdotes you’re
expected to share at a dinner party, and
less
interested
in
role-playing,
even
when they know what the cues are. It’s
as if low self-monitors (LSMs) and high
self-monitors (HSMs) play to different
audiences, Snyder has said: one inner,
the other outer.
If you want to know how strong a
self-monitor you are, here are a few
603/929
questions from Snyder’s Self-Monitoring
Scale:
• When you’re uncertain how to
act in a social situation, do you
look to the behavior of others
for cues?
• Do you often seek the advice of
your friends to choose movies,
books, or music?
• In different situations and with
different people, do you often
act like very different people?
• Do you find it easy to imitate
other people?
• Can you look someone in the
eye and tell a lie with a straight
face if for a right end?
• Do you ever deceive people by
being friendly when really you
dislike them?
604/929
• Do you put on a show to im-
press or entertain people?
• Do you sometimes appear to
others to be experiencing deep-
er emotions than you actually
are?
The more times you answered “yes” to
these questions, the more of a high self-
monitor you are.
Now ask yourself these questions:
• Is your behavior usually an ex-
pression of your true inner feel-
ings, attitudes, and beliefs?
• Do you find that you can only
argue for ideas that you already
believe?
• Would
you
refuse
to
change
your opinions, or the way you
do things, in order to please
605/929
someone
else
or
win
their
favor?
• Do
you
dislike
games
like
charades
or
improvisational
acting?
• Do you have trouble changing
your behavior to suit different
people and different situations?
The more you tended to answer “yes”
to this second set of questions, the
more of a low self-monitor you are.
When Professor Little introduced the
concept of self-monitoring to his per-
sonality psychology classes, some stu-
dents got very worked up about wheth-
er it was ethical to be a high self-monit-
or. A few “mixed” couples—HSMs and
LSMs in love—even broke up over it, he
was told. To high self-monitors, low
self-monitors can seem rigid and so-
cially awkward. To low self-monitors,
606/929
high self-monitors can come across as
conformist and deceptive—“more prag-
matic
than
principled,”
in
Mark
Snyder’s
words.
Indeed,
HSMs
have
been found to be better liars than LSMs,
which would seem to support the mor-
alistic
stance
taken
by
low
self-
monitors.
But Little, an ethical and sympathetic
man who happens to be an extremely
high self-monitor, sees things differ-
ently. He views self-monitoring as an
act of modesty. It’s about accommodat-
ing oneself to situational norms, rather
than
“grinding
down
everything
to
one’s own needs and concerns.” Not all
self-monitoring is based on acting, he
says, or on working the room. A more
introverted version may be less con-
cerned with spotlight-seeking and more
with the avoidance of social faux pas.
When Professor Little makes a great
607/929
speech, it’s partly because he’s self-
monitoring every moment, continually
checking his audience for subtle signs
of pleasure or boredom and adjusting
his presentation to meet its needs.
So if you can fake it, if you master the
acting skills, the attention to social nu-
ance, and the willingness to submit to
social norms that self-monitoring re-
quires, should you? The answer is that a
Free Trait strategy can be effective
when used judiciously, but disastrous if
overdone.
Recently I spoke on a panel at Har-
vard Law School. The occasion was the
fifty-fifth anniversary of women being
admitted to the law school. Alumnae
from all over the country gathered on
608/929
campus to celebrate. The subject of the
panel
was
“In
a
Different
Voice:
Strategies for Powerful Self-Presenta-
tion.” There were four speakers: a trial
lawyer,
a
judge,
a
public-speaking
coach, and me. I’d prepared my re-
marks carefully;
I knew the role
I
wanted to play.
The public-speaking coach went first.
She talked about how to give a talk that
knocks people’s socks off. The judge,
who happened to be Korean-American,
spoke of how frustrating it is when
people assume that all Asians are quiet
and studious when in fact she’s outgo-
ing and assertive. The litigator, who
was petite and blond and feisty as hell,
talked about the time she conducted a
cross-examination only to be admon-
ished by a judge to “Back down, tiger!”
When my turn came, I aimed my re-
marks at the women in the audience
609/929
who didn’t see themselves as tigers,
myth-busters, or sock-knocker-offers. I
said that the ability to negotiate is not
inborn, like blond hair or straight teeth,
and it does not belong exclusively to
the
table-pounders
of
the
world.
Anyone can be a great negotiator, I told
them, and in fact it often pays to be
quiet and gracious, to listen more than
talk, and to have an instinct for har-
mony rather than conflict. With this
style, you can take aggressive positions
without inflaming your counterpart’s
ego. And by listening, you can learn
what’s
truly
motivating
the
person
you’re negotiating with and come up
with creative solutions that satisfy both
parties.
I
also
shared
some
psychological
tricks for feeling calm and secure dur-
ing intimidating situations, such as pay-
ing attention to how your face and
610/929
body arrange themselves when you’re
feeling genuinely confident, and adopt-
ing those same positions when it comes
time to fake it. Studies show that taking
simple
physical
steps—like
smil-
ing—makes us feel stronger and happi-
er, while frowning makes us feel worse.
Naturally, when the panel was over
and the audience member came around
to chat with the panelists, it was the in-
troverts
and
pseudo-extroverts
who
sought me out. Two of those women
stand out in my mind.
The first was Alison, a trial lawyer.
Alison
was
slim
and
meticulously
groomed,
but
her
face
was
pale,
pinched, and unhappy-looking. She’d
been a litigator at the same corporate
law firm for over a decade. Now she
was applying for general counsel posi-
tions
at
various
companies,
which
seemed a logical next step, except that
611/929
her heart clearly wasn’t in it. And sure
enough, she hadn’t gotten a single job
offer. On the strength of her creden-
tials, she was advancing to the final
round of interviews, only to be weeded
out at the last minute. And she knew
why, because the head-hunter who’d
coordinated her interviews gave the
same feedback each time: she lacked
the right personality for the job. Alison,
a
self-described
introvert,
looked
pained as she related this damning
judgment.
The second alumna, Jillian, held a
senior position at an environmental ad-
vocacy organization that she loved. Jil-
lian came across as kind, cheerful, and
down-to-earth. She was fortunate to
spend much of her time researching
and writing policy papers on topics she
cared about. Sometimes, though, she
had
to
chair
meetings
and
make
612/929
presentations. Although she felt deep
satisfaction after these meetings, she
didn’t enjoy the spotlight, and wanted
my advice on staying cool when she felt
scared.
So what was the difference between
Alison and Jillian? Both were pseudo-
extroverts, and you might say that Alis-
on was trying and failing where Jillian
was succeeding. But Alison’s problem
was actually that she was acting out of
character in the service of a project she
didn’t care about. She didn’t love the
law. She’d chosen to become a Wall
Street litigator because it seemed to her
that this was what powerful and suc-
cessful lawyers did, so her pseudo-ex-
troversion was not supported by deeper
values. She was not telling herself, I’m
doing this to advance work I care about
deeply, and when the work is done I’ll
settle back into my true self. Instead, her
613/929
interior monologue was The route to
success is to be the sort of person I am
not. This is not self-monitoring; it is
self-negation. Where Jillian acts out of
character for the sake of worthy tasks
that temporarily require a different ori-
entation, Alison believes that there is
something fundamentally wrong with
who she is.
It’s not always so easy, it turns out,
to identify your core personal projects.
And it can be especially tough for intro-
verts, who have spent so much of their
lives conforming to extroverted norms
that by the time they choose a career,
or a calling, it feels perfectly normal to
ignore their own preferences. They may
be uncomfortable in law school or nurs-
ing school or in the marketing depart-
ment, but no more so than they were
back in middle school or summer camp.
614/929
I, too, was once in this position. I en-
joyed practicing corporate law, and for
a while I convinced myself that I was
an attorney at heart. I badly wanted to
believe it, since I had already invested
years
in
law
school
and
on-the-job
training, and much about Wall Street
law was alluring. My colleagues were
intellectual,
kind,
and
considerate
(mostly). I made a good living. I had an
office on the forty-second floor of a sky-
scraper with views of the Statue of
Liberty. I enjoyed the idea that I could
flourish in such a high-powered envir-
onment. And I was pretty good at ask-
ing the “but” and “what if” questions
that are central to the thought pro-
cesses of most lawyers.
It took me almost a decade to under-
stand that the law was never my per-
sonal project, not even close. Today I
can tell you unhesitatingly what is: my
615/929
husband and sons; writing; promoting
the values of this book. Once I realized
this, I had to make a change. I look
back on my years as a Wall Street law-
yer as time spent in a foreign country.
It was absorbing, it was exciting, and I
got to meet a lot of interesting people
whom I never would have known oth-
erwise. But I was always an expatriate.
Having spent so much time navigat-
ing my own career transition and coun-
seling others through theirs, I have
found that there are three key steps to
identifying
your
own
core
personal
projects.
First, think back to what you loved to
do when you were a child. How did
you answer the question of what you
wanted to be when you grew up? The
specific answer you gave may have
been off the mark, but the underlying
impulse was not. If you wanted to be a
616/929
fireman, what did a fireman mean to
you? A good man who rescued people
in distress? A daredevil? Or the simple
pleasure of operating a truck? If you
wanted to be a dancer, was it because
you got to wear a costume, or because
you craved applause, or was it the pure
joy
of
twirling
around
at
lightning
speed? You may have known more
about who you were then than you do
now.
Second, pay attention to the work
you gravitate to. At my law firm I never
once volunteered to take on an extra
corporate legal assignment, but I did
spend a lot of time doing pro bono
work for a nonprofit women’s leader-
ship organization. I also sat on several
law firm committees dedicated to ment-
oring, training, and personal develop-
ment for young lawyers in the firm.
Now, as you can probably tell from this
617/929
book, I am not the committee type. But
the goals of those committees lit me up,
so that’s what I did.
Finally, pay attention to what you
envy. Jealousy is an ugly emotion, but
it tells the truth. You mostly envy those
who have what you desire. I met my
own envy after some of my former law
school
classmates
got
together
and
compared
notes
on
alumni
career
tracks.
They
spoke
with
admiration
and, yes, jealousy, of a classmate who
argued regularly before the Supreme
Court. At first I felt critical. More power
to that classmate! I thought, congratu-
lating myself on my magnanimity. Then
I realized that my largesse came cheap,
because I didn’t aspire to argue a case
before the Supreme Court, or to any of
the other accolades of lawyering. When
I asked myself whom I did envy, the an-
swer came back instantly. My college
618/929
classmates
who’d
grown
up
to
be
writers or psychologists. Today I’m pur-
suing my own version of both those
roles.
But even if you’re stretching yourself in
the service of a core personal project,
you don’t want to act out of character
too much, or for too long. Remember
those trips Professor Little made to the
restroom in between speeches? Those
hideout sessions tell us that, paradoxic-
ally, the best way to act out of charac-
ter is to stay as true to yourself as you
possibly can—starting by creating as
many “restorative niches” as possible in
your daily life.
“Restorative
niche”
is
Professor
Little’s term for the place you go when
619/929
you want to return to your true self. It
can be a physical place, like the path
beside the Richelieu River, or a tempor-
al one, like the quiet breaks you plan
between sales calls. It can mean can-
celing your social plans on the weekend
before a big meeting at work, practi-
cing yoga or meditation, or choosing e-
mail over an in-person meeting. (Even
Victorian ladies, whose job effectively
was to be available to friends and fam-
ily, were expected to withdraw for a
rest each afternoon.)
You choose a restorative niche when
you close the door to your private of-
fice (if you’re lucky enough to have
one) in between meetings. You can
even create a restorative niche during a
meeting, by carefully selecting where
you sit, and when and how you parti-
cipate. In his memoir In an Uncertain
World,
Robert
Rubin,
the
treasury
620/929
secretary under President Clinton, de-
scribes how he “always liked to be
away from the center, whether in the
Oval Office or the chief of staff’s office,
where my regular seat became the foot
of the table. That little bit of physical
distance felt more comfortable to me,
and let me read the room and comment
from a perspective ever so slightly re-
moved.
I
didn’t
worry
about
being
overlooked. No matter how far away
you were sitting or standing, you could
always just say, ‘Mr. President, I think
this, that, or the other.’ ”
We would all be better off if, before
accepting a new job, we evaluated the
presence
or
absence
of
restorative
niches as carefully as we consider the
family leave policy or health insurance
plans. Introverts should ask themselves:
Will this job allow me to spend time on
in-character activities like, for example,
621/929
reading, strategizing, writing, and re-
searching? Will I have a private work-
space or be subject to the constant de-
mands of an open office plan? If the job
doesn’t
give
me
enough
restorative
niches, will I have enough free time on
evenings and weekends to grant them
to myself?
Extroverts will want to look for res-
torative niches, too. Does the job in-
volve talking, traveling, and meeting
new people? Is the office space stimu-
lating enough? If the job isn’t a perfect
fit, are the hours flexible enough that I
can blow off steam after work? Think
through the job description carefully.
One highly extroverted woman I inter-
viewed was excited about a position as
the “community organizer” for a par-
enting website, until she realized that
she’d be sitting by herself behind a
computer every day from nine to five.
622/929
Sometimes
people
find
restorative
niches in professions where you’d least
expect them. One of my former col-
leagues is a trial lawyer who spends
most of her time in splendid solitude,
researching and writing legal briefs. Be-
cause most of her cases settle, she goes
to court rarely enough that she doesn’t
mind exercising her pseudo-extrover-
sion skills when she has to. An introver-
ted
administrative
assistant
I
inter-
viewed parlayed her office experience
into a work-from-home Internet busi-
ness that serves as a clearinghouse and
coaching service for “virtual assistants.”
And in the next chapter we’ll meet a su-
perstar salesman who broke his com-
pany’s sales records year after year by
insisting on staying true to his introver-
ted self. All three of these people have
taken decidedly extroverted fields and
reinvented them in their own image, so
623/929
that they’re acting in character most of
the time, effectively turning their work-
days into one giant restorative niche.
Finding restorative niches isn’t al-
ways easy. You might want to read
quietly by the fire on Saturday nights,
but if your spouse wishes you’d spend
those evenings out with her large circle
of friends, then what? You might want
to retreat to the oasis of your private
office in between sales calls, but what if
your company just switched over to an
open office plan? If you plan to exercise
free traits, you’ll need the help of
friends, family, and colleagues. Which
is why Professor Little calls, with great
passion, for each of us to enter into “a
Free Trait Agreement.”
This is the final piece of Free Trait
Theory. A Free Trait Agreement ac-
knowledges that we’ll each act out of
character
some
of
the
time—in
624/929
exchange for being ourselves the rest of
the time. It’s a Free Trait Agreement
when a wife who wants to go out every
Saturday night and a husband who
wants to relax by the fire work out a
schedule: half the time we’ll go out, and
half the time we’ll stay home. It’s a Free
Trait Agreement when you attend your
extroverted
best
friend’s
wedding
shower, engagement celebration, and
bachelorette party, but she understands
when you skip out on the three days’
worth of group activities leading up to
the wedding itself.
It’s often possible to negotiate Free
Trait Agreements with friends and lov-
ers, whom you want to please and who
love your true, in-character self. Your
work life is a little trickier, since most
businesses still don’t think in these
terms. For now, you may have to pro-
ceed indirectly. Career counselor Shoya
625/929
Zichy told me the story of one of her
clients, an introverted financial analyst
who worked in an environment where
she was either presenting to clients or
talking to colleagues who continually
cycled in and out of her office. She was
so burned out that she planned to quit
her job—until Zichy suggested that she
negotiate for downtime.
Now, this woman worked for a Wall
Street bank, not a culture conducive to
a frank discussion about the needs of
the highly introverted. So she carefully
considered how to frame her request.
She told her boss that the very nature
of
her
work—strategic
analysis—re-
quired quiet time in which to concen-
trate. Once she made her case empiric-
ally, it was easier to ask for what she
needed
psychologically:
two
days
a
week of working from home. Her boss
said yes.
626/929
But the person with whom you can
best
strike
a
Free
Trait
Agree-
ment—after overcoming his or her res-
istance—is yourself.
Let’s say you’re single. You dislike
the bar scene, but you crave intimacy,
and you want to be in a long-term rela-
tionship in which you can share cozy
evenings and long conversations with
your partner and a small circle of
friends. In order to achieve this goal,
you make an agreement with yourself
that you will push yourself to go to so-
cial events, because only in this way
can you hope to meet a mate and re-
duce the number of gatherings you at-
tend over the long term. But while you
pursue this goal, you will attend only as
many events as you can comfortably
stand. You decide in advance what that
amount is—once a week, once a month,
once a quarter. And once you’ve met
627/929
your quota, you’ve earned the right to
stay home without feeling guilty.
Or perhaps you’ve always dreamed of
building
your
own
small
company,
working from home so you can spend
more time with your spouse and chil-
dren. You know you’ll need to do a cer-
tain amount of networking, so you
make the following Free Trait Agree-
ment with yourself: you will go to one
schmooze-fest per week. At each event
you will have at least one genuine con-
versation (since this comes easier to
you than “working the room”) and fol-
low up with that person the next day.
After that, you get to go home and not
feel bad when you turn down other net-
working opportunities that come your
way.
628/929
Professor Little knows all too well what
happens when you lack a Free Trait
Agreement with yourself. Apart from
occasional excursions to the Richelieu
River or the restroom, he once followed
a schedule that combined the most
energy-zapping elements of both intro-
version and extroversion. On the extro-
verted side, his days consisted of non-
stop lectures, meetings with students,
monitoring a student discussion group,
and writing all those letters of recom-
mendation. On the introverted side, he
took those responsibilities very, very
seriously.
“One way of looking at this,” he says
now, “is to say that I was heavily en-
gaged in extrovert-like behaviors, but,
of course, had I been a real extrovert I
would have done quicker, less nuanced
letters of recommendation, would not
have invested the time in preparation
629/929
of lectures, and the social events would
not have drained me.” He also suffered
from a certain amount of what he calls
“reputational confusion,” in which he
became known for being over-the-top
effervescent, and the reputation fed on
itself. This was the persona that others
knew, so it was the persona he felt ob-
liged to serve up.
Naturally, Professor Little started to
burn out, not only mentally but also
physically. Never mind. He loved his
students, he loved his field, he loved it
all. Until the day that he ended up in
the doctor’s office with a case of double
pneumonia that he’d been too busy to
notice. His wife had dragged him there
against his will, and a good thing too.
According to the doctors, if she had
waited much longer, he would have
died.
630/929
Double pneumonia and an oversched-
uled life can happen to anyone, of
course, but for Little, it was the result
of acting out of character for too long
and without enough restorative niches.
When
your
conscientiousness
impels
you to take on more than you can
handle, you begin to lose interest, even
in tasks that normally engage you. You
also risk your physical health. “Emo-
tional labor,” which is the effort we
make to control and change our own
emotions,
is
associated
with
stress,
burnout, and even physical symptoms
like an increase in cardiovascular dis-
ease. Professor Little believes that pro-
longed acting out of character may also
increase
autonomic
nervous
system
activity, which can, in turn, comprom-
ise immune functioning.
One noteworthy study suggests that
people who suppress negative emotions
631/929
tend to leak those emotions later in un-
expected ways. The psychologist Judith
Grob asked people to hide their emo-
tions as she showed them disgusting
images. She even had them hold pens
in their mouths to prevent them from
frowning. She found that this group re-
ported feeling less disgusted by the pic-
tures than did those who’d been al-
lowed
to
react
naturally.
Later,
however, the people who hid their
emotions suffered side effects. Their
memory was impaired, and the negat-
ive emotions they’d suppressed seemed
to color their outlook. When Grob had
them fill in the missing letter to the
word “gr_ss,” for example, they were
more likely than others to offer “gross”
rather than “grass.” “People who tend
to [suppress their negative emotions]
regularly,” concludes Grob, “might start
632/929
to see the world in a more negative
light.”
That’s why these days Professor Little
is in restorative mode, retired from the
university and reveling in his wife’s
company in their house in the Canadian
countryside. Little says that his wife,
Sue Phillips, the director of the School
of Public Policy and Administration at
Carleton University, is so much like
him that they don’t need a Free Trait
Agreement to govern their relationship.
But his Free Trait Agreement with him-
self provides that he do his remaining
“scholarly and professional deeds with
good grace,” but not “hang around
longer than necessary.”
Then he goes home and snuggles by
the fire with Sue.

THE COMMUNICATION GAP
How to Talk to Members of the Opposite
Type
The meeting of two personalities is like
the contact of two chemical substances; if
there is any reaction, both are trans-
formed.
—CARL JUNG
If introverts
and extroverts
are the
north and south of temperament—op-
posite ends of a single spectrum—then
how can they possibly get along? Yet
the two types are often drawn to each
other—in friendship, business, and es-
pecially romance. These pairs can enjoy
great excitement and mutual admira-
tion, a sense that each completes the
other. One tends to listen, the other to
talk; one is sensitive to beauty, but also
to slings and arrows, while the other
barrels cheerfully through his days; one
pays the bills and the other arranges
the children’s play dates. But it can also
cause problems when members of these
unions pull in opposite directions.
Greg and Emily are an example of an
introvert-extrovert couple who love and
madden each other in equal measure.
Greg, who just turned thirty, has a
bounding gait, a mop of dark hair con-
tinually falling over his eyes, and an
easy laugh. Most people would describe
him as gregarious. Emily, a mature
twenty-seven, is as self-contained as
Greg is expansive. Graceful and soft-
spoken, she keeps her auburn hair tied
635/929
in a chignon, and often gazes at people
from under lowered lashes.
Greg and Emily complement each
other beautifully. Without Greg, Emily
might forget to leave the house, except
to go to work. But without Emily, Greg
would feel—paradoxically for such a
social creature—alone.
Before they met, most of Greg’s girl-
friends were extroverts. He says he en-
joyed those relationships, but never got
to know his girlfriends well, because
they were always “plotting how to be
with groups of people.” He speaks of
Emily with a kind of awe, as if she has
access to a deeper state of being. He
also
describes
her
as
“the
anchor”
around which his world revolves.
Emily, for her part, treasures Greg’s
ebullient nature; he makes her feel
happy and alive. She has always been
attracted to extroverts, who she says
636/929
“do all the work of making conversa-
tion. For them, it’s not work at all.”
The trouble is that for most of the
five years they’ve been together, Greg
and Emily have been having one ver-
sion or another of the same fight. Greg,
a music promoter with a large circle of
friends, wants to host dinner parties
every Friday—casual, animated get-to-
gethers with heaping bowls of pasta
and flowing bottles of wine. He’s been
giving Friday-night dinners since he
was a senior in college, and they’ve be-
come a highlight of his week and a
treasured piece of his identity.
Emily
has
come
to
dread
these
weekly events. A hardworking staff at-
torney for an art museum and a very
private person, the last thing she wants
to do when she gets home from work is
entertain. Her idea of a perfect start to
637/929
the weekend is a quiet evening at the
movies, just her and Greg.
It seems an irreconcilable difference:
Greg wants fifty-two dinner parties a
year, Emily wants zero.
Greg says that Emily should make
more of an effort. He accuses her of be-
ing antisocial. “I am social,” she says. “I
love you, I love my family, I love my
close friends. I just don’t love dinner
parties. People don’t really relate at
those parties—they just socialize. You’re
lucky because I devote all my energy to
you.
You
spread
yours
around
to
everyone.”
But Emily soon backs off, partly be-
cause she hates fighting, but also be-
cause she doubts herself. Maybe I am
antisocial, she thinks. Maybe there is
something wrong with me. Whenever she
and
Greg
argue
about
this,
she’s
flooded with childhood memories: how
638/929
school was tougher for her than for her
emotionally hardier younger sister; how
she seemed to worry more than other
people did about social issues, like how
to say no when someone asked her to
get together after school and she pre-
ferred to stay home. Emily had plenty
of friends—she’s always had a talent for
friendship—but she never traveled in
packs.
Emily has suggested a compromise:
What if Greg gives his dinner parties
whenever she’s out of town visiting her
sister? But Greg doesn’t want to host
dinners by himself. He loves Emily and
wants to be with her, and so does
everyone else, once they get to know
her. So why does Emily withdraw?
This question, for Greg, is more than
mere pique. Being alone for him is a
kind of Kryptonite; it makes him feel
weak. He had looked forward to a
639/929
married life of shared adventures. He’d
imagined being part of a couple at the
center of things. And he’d never admit-
ted it to himself, but for him being mar-
ried meant never having to be by him-
self. But now Emily is saying that he
should socialize without her. He feels
as if she’s backing out of a fundamental
part of their marriage contract. And he
believes
that
something
is
indeed
wrong with his wife.
Is something wrong with me? It’s not sur-
prising
that
Emily
asks
herself
this
question, or that Greg aims this charge
at
her.
Probably
the
most
com-
mon—and
damaging—misunderstand-
ing about personality type is that intro-
verts are antisocial and extroverts are
640/929
pro-social. But as we’ve seen, neither
formulation is correct; introverts and
extroverts are differently social. What
psychologists call “the need for intim-
acy” is present in introverts and extro-
verts alike. In fact, people who value
intimacy highly don’t tend to be, as the
noted psychologist David Buss puts it,
“the loud, outgoing, life-of-the-party ex-
trovert.” They are more likely to be
someone with a select group of close
friends, who prefers “sincere and mean-
ingful conversations over wild parties.”
They are more likely to be someone
like Emily.
Conversely, extroverts do not neces-
sarily seek closeness from their socializ-
ing. “Extroverts seem to need people as
a forum to fill needs for social impact,
just as a general needs soldiers to fill
his or her need to lead,” the psycholo-
gist William Graziano told me. “When
641/929
extroverts show up at a party, everyone
knows they are present.”
Your degree of extroversion seems to
influence how many friends you have,
in other words, but not how good a
friend you are. In a study of 132 college
students at Humboldt University in Ber-
lin, the psychologists Jens Aspendorf
and Susanne Wilpers set out to under-
stand the effect of different personality
traits on students’ relationships with
their peers and families. They focused
on
the
so-called
Big
Five
traits:
Introversion-Extroversion;
Agreeable-
ness;
Openness
to
Experience;
Con-
scientiousness; and Emotional Stability.
(Many personality psychologists believe
that human personality can be boiled
down to these five characteristics.)
Aspendorf and Wilpers predicted that
the extroverted students would have an
easier time striking up new friendships
642/929
than the introverts, and this was indeed
the case. But if the introverts were truly
antisocial
and
extroverts
pro-social,
then you’d suppose that the students
with the most harmonious relationships
would also be highest in extroversion.
And this was not the case at all. In-
stead, the students whose relationships
were freest of conflict had high scores
for agreeableness. Agreeable people are
warm, supportive, and loving; personal-
ity psychologists have found that if you
sit them down in front of a computer
screen of words, they focus longer than
others do on words like caring, console,
and help, and a shorter time on words
like abduct, assault, and harass. Intro-
verts and extroverts are equally likely
to be agreeable; there is no correlation
between extroversion and agreeable-
ness. This explains why some extroverts
love the stimulation of socializing but
643/929
don’t get along particularly well with
those closest to them.
It also helps explain why some intro-
verts—like
Emily,
whose
talent
for
friendship suggests that she’s a highly
agreeable type herself—lavish attention
on their family and close friends but
dislike small talk. So when Greg labels
Emily “antisocial,” he’s off base. Emily
nurtures her marriage in just the way
that you’d expect an agreeable introvert
to do, making Greg the center of her so-
cial universe.
Except when she doesn’t. Emily has a
demanding job, and sometimes when
she gets home at night she has little en-
ergy left. She’s always happy to see
Greg, but sometimes she’d rather sit
next to him reading than go out for din-
ner or make animated conversation.
Simply to be in his company is enough.
For Emily, this is perfectly natural, but
644/929
Greg feels hurt that she makes an effort
for her colleagues and not for him.
This was a painfully common dynam-
ic in the introvert-extrovert couples I
interviewed: the introverts desperately
craving downtime and understanding
from their partners, the extroverts long-
ing for company, and resentful that oth-
ers seemed to benefit from their part-
ners’ “best” selves.
It can be hard for extroverts to un-
derstand how badly introverts need to
recharge at the end of a busy day. We
all empathize with a sleep-deprived
mate who comes home from work too
tired to talk, but it’s harder to grasp
that social overstimulation can be just
as exhausting.
It’s also hard for introverts to under-
stand just how hurtful their silence can
be.
I
interviewed
a
woman
named
Sarah,
a
bubbly
and
dynamic
high
645/929
school English teacher married to Bob,
an introverted law school dean who
spends his days fund-raising, then col-
lapses when he gets home. Sarah cried
tears of frustration and loneliness as
she told me about her marriage.
“When he’s on the job, he’s amaz-
ingly engaging,” she said. “Everyone
tells me that he’s so funny and I’m so
lucky to be married to him. And I want
to throttle them. Every night, as soon as
we’re done eating, he jumps up and
cleans the kitchen. Then he wants to
read the paper alone and work on his
photography
by
himself.
At
around
nine, he comes into the bedroom and
wants to watch TV and be with me. But
he’s not really with me even then. He
wants
me
to
lay
my
head
on
his
shoulder while we stare at the TV. It’s a
grownup
version
of
parallel
play.”
Sarah is trying to convince Bob to make
646/929
a career change. “I think we’d have a
great life if he had a job where he could
sit at the computer all day, but he’s
consistently fund-raising,” she says.
In couples where the man is introver-
ted and the woman extroverted, as with
Sarah and Bob, we often mistake per-
sonality conflicts for gender difference,
then trot out the conventional wisdom
that “Mars” needs to retreat to his cave
while “Venus” prefers to interact. But
whatever the reason for these differ-
ences in social needs—whether gender
or temperament—what’s important is
that it’s possible to work through them.
In The Audacity of Hope, for example,
President Obama confides that early in
his marriage to Michelle, he was work-
ing on his first book and “would often
spend the evening holed up in my of-
fice in the back of our railroad apart-
ment; what I considered normal often
647/929
left Michelle feeling lonely.” He attrib-
utes his own style to the demands of
writing
and
to
having
been
raised
mostly as an only child, and then says
that he and Michelle have learned over
the years to meet each other’s needs,
and to see them as legitimate.
It can also be hard for introverts and
extroverts to understand each other’s
ways of resolving differences. One of
my clients was an immaculately dressed
lawyer named Celia. Celia wanted a di-
vorce, but dreaded letting her husband
know. She had good reasons for her de-
cision but anticipated that he would
beg her to stay and that she would
crumple with guilt. Above all, Celia
648/929
wanted
to
deliver
her
news
compassionately.
We decided to role-play their discus-
sion, with me acting as her husband.
“I want to end this marriage,” said
Celia. “I mean it this time.”
“I’ve been doing everything I can to
hold things together,” I pleaded. “How
can you do this to me?”
Celia thought for a minute.
“I’ve spent a lot of time thinking this
through, and I believe this is the right
decision,”
she replied in a wooden
voice.
“What
can
I
do
to
change
your
mind?” I asked.
“Nothing,” said Celia flatly.
Feeling for a minute what her hus-
band would feel, I was dumbstruck. She
was so rote, so dispassionate. She was
about to divorce me—me, her husband
of eleven years! Didn’t she care?
649/929
I asked Celia to try again, this time
with emotion in her voice.
“I can’t,” she said. “I can’t do it.”
But she did. “I want to end this mar-
riage,” she repeated, her voice choked
with
sadness.
She
began
to
weep
uncontrollably.
Celia’s problem was not lack of feel-
ing. It was how to show her emotions
without losing control. Reaching for a
tissue, she quickly gathered herself, and
went back into crisp, dispassionate law-
yer mode. These were the two gears to
which
she
had
ready
access—over-
whelming
feelings
or
detached
self-
possession.
I tell you Celia’s story because in
many ways she’s a lot like Emily and
many introverts I’ve interviewed. Emily
is talking to Greg about dinner parties,
not divorce, but her communication
style echoes Celia’s. When she and Greg
650/929
disagree, her voice gets quiet and flat,
her manner slightly distant. What she’s
trying
to
do
is
minimize
aggres-
sion—Emily is uncomfortable with an-
ger—but she appears to be receding
emotionally. Meanwhile, Greg does just
the
opposite,
raising
his
voice
and
sounding belligerent as he gets ever
more engaged in working out their
problem. The more Emily seems to
withdraw, the more alone, then hurt,
then enraged Greg becomes; the angrier
he gets, the more hurt and distaste
Emily feels, and the deeper she retreats.
Pretty soon they’re locked in a destruct-
ive cycle from which they can’t escape,
partly because both spouses believe
they’re
arguing
in
an
appropriate
manner.
This dynamic shouldn’t surprise any-
one
familiar
with
the
relationship
between
personality
and
conflict
651/929
resolution style. Just as men and wo-
men
often
have
different
ways
of
resolving conflict, so do introverts and
extroverts;
studies
suggest
that
the
former
tend
to
be
conflict-avoiders,
while
the
latter
are
“confrontive
copers,” at ease with an up-front, even
argumentative style of disagreement.
These are diametrically opposite ap-
proaches, so they’re bound to create
friction. If Emily didn’t mind conflict so
much, she might not react so strongly
to Greg’s head-on approach; if Greg
were milder-mannered, he might appre-
ciate Emily’s attempt to keep a lid on
things. When people have compatible
styles of conflict, a disagreement can be
an occasion for each partner to affirm
the other’s point of view. But Greg and
Emily seem to understand each other a
little less each time they argue in a way
that the other disapproves of.
652/929
Do they also like each other a little
less, at least for the duration of the
fight? An illuminating study by the psy-
chologist
William
Graziano
suggests
that the answer to this question might
be yes. Graziano divided a group of
sixty-one male students into teams to
play a simulated football game. Half
the participants were assigned to a co-
operative game, in which they were
told, “Football is useful to us because to
be successful in football, team members
have to work well together.” The other
half were assigned to a game emphasiz-
ing competition between teams. Each
student was then shown slides and fab-
ricated biographical information about
his teammates and his competitors on
the other team, and asked to rate how
he felt about the other players.
The differences between introverts
and extroverts were remarkable. The
653/929
introverts assigned to the cooperative
game rated all players—not just their
competitors,
but
also
their
team-
mates—more positively than the intro-
verts who played the competitive game.
The extroverts did just the opposite:
they rated all players more positively
when they played the competitive ver-
sion of the game. These findings sug-
gest something very important: intro-
verts like people they meet in friendly
contexts; extroverts prefer those they
compete with.
A very different study, in which ro-
bots
interacted
with
stroke
patients
during physical rehabilitation exercises,
yielded strikingly similar results. Intro-
verted patients responded better and in-
teracted longer with robots that were
designed to speak in a soothing, gentle
manner: “I know it is hard, but remem-
ber that it’s for your own good,” and,
654/929
“Very nice, keep up the good work.”
Extroverts, on the other hand, worked
harder for robots that used more bra-
cing, aggressive language: “You can do
more than that, I know it!” and “Con-
centrate on your exercise!”
These findings suggest that Greg and
Emily face an interesting challenge. If
Greg likes people more when they’re
behaving forcefully or competitively,
and if Emily feels the same way about
nurturing,
cooperative
people,
then
how
can
they
reach
a
compromise
about their dinner-party impasse—and
get there in a loving way?
An intriguing answer comes from a
University of Michigan business school
study, not of married couples with op-
posite personality styles, but of negoti-
ators from different cultures—in this
case, Asians and Israelis. Seventy-six
MBA students from Hong Kong and
655/929
Israel were asked to imagine they were
getting married in a few months and
had to finalize arrangements with a ca-
tering company for the wedding recep-
tion.
This
“meeting”
took
place
by
video.
Some of the students were shown a
video in which the business manager
was friendly and smiley; the others saw
a video featuring an irritable and antag-
onistic manager. But the caterer’s mes-
sage was the same in both cases. Anoth-
er couple was interested in the same
wedding date. The price had gone up.
Take it or leave it.
The students from Hong Kong re-
acted very differently from the Israeli
students. The Asians were far more
likely to accept a proposal from the
friendly business manager than from
the hostile one; only 14 percent were
willing
to
work
with
the
difficult
656/929
manager, while 71 percent accepted the
deal from the smiling caterer. But the
Israelis were just as likely to accept the
deal
from
either
manager.
In
other
words, for the Asian negotiators, style
counted as well as substance, while the
Israelis were more focused on the in-
formation being conveyed. They were
unmoved by a display of either sym-
pathetic or hostile emotions.
The explanation for this stark differ-
ence has to do with how the two cul-
tures define respect. As we saw in
chapter 8, many Asian people show es-
teem by minimizing conflict. But Israel-
is, say the researchers, “are not likely to
view [disagreement] as a sign of dis-
respect, but as a signal that the oppos-
ing party is concerned and is passion-
ately engaged in the task.”
We might say the same of Greg and
Emily. When Emily lowers her voice
657/929
and flattens her affect during fights
with Greg, she thinks she’s being re-
spectful by taking the trouble not to let
her negative emotions show. But Greg
thinks she’s checking out or, worse,
that she doesn’t give a damn. Similarly,
when Greg lets his anger fly, he as-
sumes that Emily feels, as he does, that
this is a healthy and honest expression
of their deeply committed relationship.
But to Emily, it’s as if Greg has sud-
denly turned on her.
In her book Anger: The Misunderstood
Emotion, Carol Tavris recounts a story
about a Bengali cobra that liked to bite
passing villagers. One day a swami—a
man
who
has
achieved
self-mas-
tery—convinces the snake that biting is
658/929
wrong. The cobra vows to stop immedi-
ately, and does. Before long, the village
boys grow unafraid of the snake and
start to abuse him. Battered and blood-
ied, the snake complains to the swami
that this is what came of keeping his
promise.
“I told you not to bite,” said the
swami, “but I did not tell you not to
hiss.”
“Many people, like the swami’s co-
bra, confuse the hiss with the bite,”
writes Tavris.
Many people—like Greg and Emily.
Both have much to learn from the
swami’s
story:
Greg
to
stop
biting,
Emily that it’s OK for him—and for
her—to hiss.
Greg can start by changing his as-
sumptions about anger. He believes, as
most of us do, that venting anger lets
off
steam.
The
“catharsis
659/929
hypothesis”—that aggression builds up
inside
us
until
it’s
healthily
re-
leased—dates back to the Greeks, was
revived by Freud, and gained steam
during the “let it all hang out” 1960s of
punching bags and primal screams. But
the catharsis hypothesis is a myth—a
plausible one, an elegant one, but a
myth
nonetheless.
Scores
of
studies
have shown that venting doesn’t soothe
anger; it fuels it.
We’re best off when we don’t allow
ourselves to go to our angry place.
Amazingly, neuroscientists have even
found
that
people
who
use
Botox,
which
prevents
them
from
making
angry faces, seem to be less anger-
prone than those who don’t, because
the very act of frowning triggers the
amygdala to process negative emotions.
And anger is not just damaging in the
moment; for days afterward, venters
660/929
have repair work to do with their part-
ners. Despite the popular fantasy of fab-
ulous sex after fighting, many couples
say that it takes time to feel loving
again.
What can Greg do to calm down
when he feels his fury mounting? He
can take a deep breath. He can take a
ten-minute break. And he can ask him-
self whether the thing that’s making
him so angry is really that important. If
not, he might let it go. But if it is, then
he’ll want to phrase his needs not as
personal attacks but as neutral discus-
sion items. “You’re so antisocial!” can
become “Can we figure out a way to or-
ganize our weekends that works for us
both?”
This advice would hold even if Emily
weren’t a sensitive introvert (no one
likes to feel dominated or disrespected),
but it so happens that Greg’s married to
661/929
a woman who is especially put off by
anger. So he needs to respond to the
conflict-avoidant wife he has, not the
confrontational one that he wishes, at
least in the heat of the moment, he
were married to.
Now let’s look at Emily’s side of the
equation. What could she be doing dif-
ferently? She’s right to protest when
Greg
bites—when
he
attacks
un-
fairly—but what about when he hisses?
Emily might address her own counter-
productive reactions to anger, among
them her tendency to slip into a cycle
of guilt and defensiveness. We know
from chapter 6 that many introverts are
prone from earliest childhood to strong
guilt feelings; we also know that we all
tend to project our own reactions onto
others. Because conflict-avoidant Emily
would never “bite” or even hiss unless
Greg
had
done
something
truly
662/929
horrible, on some level she processes
his bite to mean that she’s terribly
guilty—of
something,
anything,
who
knows what? Emily’s guilt feels so in-
tolerable that she tends to deny the
validity of all of Greg’s claims—the le-
gitimate ones along with those exagger-
ated by anger. This, of course, leads to
a vicious cycle in which she shuts down
her natural empathy and Greg feels
unheard.
So Emily needs to accept that it’s OK
to be in the wrong. At first she may
have trouble puzzling out when she is
and when she isn’t; the fact that Greg
expresses his grievances with such pas-
sion makes it hard to sort this out. But
Emily must try not to get dragged into
this morass. When Greg makes legitim-
ate
points,
she
should
acknowledge
them, not only to be a good partner to
her husband, but also to teach herself
663/929
that it’s OK to have transgressed. This
will make it easier for her not to feel
hurt—and to fight back—when Greg’s
claims are unjustified.
Fight back? But Emily hates fighting.
That’s OK. She needs to become more
comfortable with the sound of her own
hiss.
Introverts
may
be
hesitant
to
cause disharmony, but, like the passive
snake, they should be equally worried
about encouraging vitriol from their
partners. And fighting back may not in-
vite retaliation, as Emily fears; instead
it may encourage Greg to back off. She
need not put on a huge display. Often,
a firm “that’s not OK with me” will do.
Every once in a while, Emily might
also want to step outside her usual
comfort zone and let her own anger fly.
Remember, for Greg, heat means con-
nection. In the same way that the extro-
verted players in the football game
664/929
study felt warmly toward their fellow
competitors, so Greg may feel closer to
Emily if she can take on just a little of
the coloration of a pumped-up player,
ready to take the field.
Emily can also overcome her own
distaste for Greg’s behavior by remind-
ing herself that he’s not really as ag-
gressive as he seems. John, an introvert
I interviewed who has a great relation-
ship with his fiery wife, describes how
he learned to do this after twenty-five
years of marriage:
When
Jennifer’s
after
me
about
something, she’s really after me. If I
went to bed without tidying the kit-
chen, the next morning she’ll shout
at me, “This kitchen is filthy!” I
come in and look around the kit-
chen. There are three or four cups
out; it’s not filthy. But the drama
665/929
with which she imbues such mo-
ments is natural to her. That’s her
way of saying, Gee, when you get a
chance I’d appreciate it if you could
just tidy up the kitchen a little more. If
she did say it that way to me, I
would say, I’d be happy to, and I’m
sorry that I didn’t do it sooner. But be-
cause she comes at me with that
two-hundred-mile-per-hour
freight-
train energy, I want to bridle and
say, Too bad. The reason I don’t is
because
we’ve
been
married
for
twenty-five years, and I’ve come to
understand that Jennifer didn’t put
me in a life-threatening situation
when she spoke that way.
So what’s John’s secret for relating to
his forceful wife? He lets her know that
her words were unacceptable, but he
also tries to listen to their meaning. “I
666/929
try to tap into my empathy,” he says. “I
take her tone out of the equation. I take
out the assault on my senses, and I try
to get to what she’s trying to say.”
And what Jennifer is trying to say,
underneath her freight-train words, is
often quite simple: Respect me. Pay at-
tention to me. Love me.
Greg and Emily now have valuable
insights about how to talk through their
differences. But there’s one more ques-
tion they need to answer: Why exactly
do they experience those Friday-night
dinner parties so differently? We know
that Emily’s nervous system probably
goes into overdrive when she enters a
room full of people. And we know that
Greg feels the opposite: propelled to-
ward
people,
conversations,
events,
anything that gives him that dopamine-
fueled, go-for-it sensation that extro-
verts crave. But let’s dig a little deeper
667/929
into the anatomy of cocktail-hour chat-
ter. The key to bridging Greg and
Emily’s differences lies in the details.
Some years ago, thirty-two pairs of in-
troverts and extroverts, all of them
strangers to each other, chatted on the
phone for a few minutes as part of an
experiment conducted by a neuroscient-
ist named Dr. Matthew Lieberman, then
a graduate student at Harvard. When
they hung up, they were asked to fill
out detailed questionnaires, rating how
they’d felt and behaved during the con-
versation. How much did you like your
conversational partner? How friendly
were you? How much would you like to
interact with this person again? They
were also asked to put themselves in
668/929
the shoes of their conversational part-
ners: How much did your partner like
you? How sensitive was she to you?
How encouraging?
Lieberman and his team compared
the answers and also listened in on the
conversations
and
made
their
own
judgments about how the parties felt
about each other. They found that the
extroverts were a lot more accurate
than the introverts in assessing whether
their partner liked talking to them.
These findings suggest that extroverts
are better at decoding social cues than
introverts. At first, this seems unsur-
prising, writes Lieberman; it echoes the
popular assumption that extroverts are
better at reading social situations. The
only problem, as Lieberman showed
through a further twist to his experi-
ment, is that this assumption is not
quite right.
669/929
Lieberman and his team asked a se-
lect group of participants to listen to a
tape of the conversations they’d just
had—before filling out the question-
naire. In this group, he found, there
was no difference between introverts
and extroverts in their ability to read
social cues. Why?
The answer is that the subjects who
listened to the tape recording were able
to decode social cues without having to
do anything else at the same time. And in-
troverts are pretty fine decoders, ac-
cording to several studies predating the
Lieberman experiments. One of these
studies actually found that introverts
were better decoders than extroverts.
But these studies measured how well
introverts observe social dynamics, not
how well they participate in them. Par-
ticipation places a very different set of
demands on the brain than observing
670/929
does. It requires a kind of mental multi-
tasking: the ability to process a lot of
short-term information at once without
becoming distracted or overly stressed.
This is just the sort of brain functioning
that extroverts tend to be well suited
for. In other words, extroverts are soci-
able because their brains are good at
handling competing demands on their
attention—which is just what dinner-
party conversation involves. In con-
trast, introverts often feel repelled by
social events that force them to attend
to many people at once.
Consider that the simplest social in-
teraction between two people requires
performing
an
astonishing
array
of
tasks: interpreting what the other per-
son is saying; reading body language
and facial expressions; smoothly taking
turns talking and listening; responding
to what the other person said; assessing
671/929
whether you’re being understood; de-
termining
whether
you’re
well
re-
ceived, and, if not, figuring out how to
improve or remove yourself from the
situation. Think of what it takes to
juggle all this at once! And that’s just a
one-on-one conversation. Now imagine
the multitasking required in a group
setting like a dinner party.
So when introverts assume the ob-
server role, as when they write novels,
or contemplate unified field theory—or
fall quiet at dinner parties—they’re not
demonstrating a failure of will or a lack
of energy. They’re simply doing what
they’re constitutionally suited for.
The Lieberman experiment helps us un-
derstand
what
trips
up
introverts
672/929
socially. It doesn’t show us how they
can shine.
Consider the case of an unassuming-
looking fellow named Jon Berghoff. Jon
is a stereotypical introvert, right down
to his physical appearance: lean, wiry
body;
sharply
etched
nose
and
cheekbones; thoughtful expression on
his bespectacled face. He’s not much of
a talker, but what he says is carefully
considered, especially when he’s in a
group: “If I’m in a room with ten
people and I have a choice between
talking and not talking,” he says, “I’m
the one not talking. When people ask,
‘Why aren’t you saying anything?’ I’m
the guy they’re saying it to.”
Jon is also a standout salesman, and
has been ever since he was a teenager.
In the summer of 1999, when he was
still a junior in high school, he started
working as an entry-level distributor,
673/929
selling Cutco kitchen products. The job
had him going into customers’ homes,
selling knives. It was one of the most
intimate
sales
situations
imaginable,
not in a boardroom or a car dealership,
but inside a potential client’s kitchen,
selling them a product they’d use daily
to help put food on the table.
Within Jon’s first eight weeks on the
job, he sold $50,000 worth of knives.
He went on to be the company’s top
representative from over 40,000 new
recruits that year. By the year 2000,
when he was still a high school senior,
Jon had generated more than $135,000
in commissions and had broken more
than twenty-five national and regional
sales records. Meanwhile, back in high
school, he was still a socially awkward
guy who hid inside the library at lunch-
time. But by 2002 he’d recruited, hired,
and trained ninety other sales reps, and
674/929
increased territory sales 500 percent
over the previous year. Since then, Jon
has
launched
Global
Empowerment
Coaching, his own personal coaching
and sales training business. To date he’s
given hundreds of speeches, training
seminars, and private consultations to
more
than
30,000
salespeople
and
managers.
What’s the secret of Jon’s success?
One important clue comes from an ex-
periment by the developmental psycho-
logist Avril Thorne, now a professor at
the University of California, Santa Cruz.
Thorne
gathered
fifty-two
young
women—twenty-six
introverts
and
twenty-six
extroverts—and
assigned
them to two different conversational
pairings. Each person had one ten-
minute conversation with a partner of
her own type and a second conversa-
tion
of
equal
length
with
her
675/929
“dispositional opposite.” Thorne’s team
taped the conversations and asked the
participants to listen to a playback
tape.
This process revealed some surprising
findings. The introverts and extroverts
participated about equally, giving the
lie to the idea that introverts always
talk less. But the introvert pairs tended
to focus on one or two serious subjects
of conversation, while the extrovert
pairs chose lighter-hearted and wider-
ranging topics. Often the introverts dis-
cussed problems or conflicts in their
lives: school, work, friendships, and so
on. Perhaps because of this fondness for
“problem talk,” they tended to adopt
the role of adviser, taking turns coun-
seling each other on the problem at
hand. The extroverts, by contrast, were
more likely to offer casual information
about
themselves
that
established
676/929
commonality with the other person:
You have a new dog? That’s great. A
friend of mine has an amazing tank of
saltwater fish!
But
the
most
interesting
part
of
Thorne’s experiment was how much the
two types appreciated each other. Intro-
verts talking to extroverts chose cheeri-
er topics, reported making conversation
more easily, and described conversing
with extroverts as a “breath of fresh
air.” In contrast, the extroverts felt that
they could relax more with introvert
partners and were freer to confide their
problems. They didn’t feel pressure to
be falsely upbeat.
These are useful pieces of social in-
formation.
Introverts
and
extroverts
sometimes feel mutually put off, but
Thorne’s research suggests how much
each has to offer the other. Extroverts
need
to
know
that
introverts—who
677/929
often
seem
to
disdain
the
superfi-
cial—may be only too happy to be
tugged along to a more lighthearted
place; and introverts, who sometimes
feel as if their propensity for problem
talk makes them a drag, should know
that they make it safe for others to get
serious.
Thorne’s research also helps us to un-
derstand
Jon
Berghoff’s
astonishing
success at sales. He has turned his affin-
ity for serious conversation, and for ad-
opting an advisory role rather than a
persuasive one, into a kind of therapy
for his prospects. “I discovered early on
that people don’t buy from me because
they understand what I’m selling,” ex-
plains Jon. “They buy because they feel
understood.”
Jon also benefits from his natural
tendency to ask a lot of questions and
to listen closely to the answers. “I got
678/929
to the point where I could walk into
someone’s house and instead of trying
to sell them some knives, I’d ask a hun-
dred questions in a row. I could man-
age the entire conversation just by ask-
ing the right questions.” Today, in his
coaching business, Jon does the same
thing. “I try to tune in to the radio sta-
tion of the person I’m working with. I
pay attention to the energy they exude.
It’s easy for me to do that because I’m
in my head a lot, anyways.”
But doesn’t salesmanship require the
ability to get excited, to pump people
up? Not according to Jon. “A lot of
people believe that selling requires be-
ing a fast talker, or knowing how to use
charisma to persuade. Those things do
require an extroverted way of commu-
nicating. But in sales there’s a truism
that ‘we have two ears and one mouth
and
we
should
use
them
679/929
proportionately.’ I believe that’s what
makes someone really good at selling or
consulting—the
number-one
thing
is
they’ve got to really listen well. When I
look at the top salespeople in my or-
ganization, none of those extroverted
qualities are the key to their success.”
And now back to Greg and Emily’s im-
passe. We’ve just acquired two crucial
pieces of information: first, Emily’s dis-
taste for conversational multitasking is
real and explicable; and second, when
introverts are able to experience con-
versations in their own way, they make
deep and enjoyable connections with
others.
It was only once they accepted these
two realities that Greg and Emily found
680/929
a way to break their stalemate. Instead
of focusing on the number of dinner
parties they’d give, they started talking
about the format of the parties. Instead
of seating everyone around a big table,
which would require the kind of all-
hands
conversational
multitasking
Emily dislikes so much, why not serve
dinner buffet style, with people eating
in small, casual conversational group-
ings on the sofas and floor pillows?
This would allow Greg to gravitate to
his usual spot at the center of the room
and Emily to hers on the outskirts,
where
she
could
have
the
kind
of
intimate, one-on-one conversations she
enjoys.
This issue solved, the couple was
now free to address the thornier ques-
tion of how many parties to give. After
some back-and-forth, they agreed on
two
evenings
a
month—twenty-four
681/929
dinners a year—instead of fifty-two.
Emily still doesn’t look forward to these
events. But she sometimes enjoys them
in spite of herself. And Greg gets to
host the evenings he enjoys so much, to
hold on to his identity, and to be with
the person he most adores—all at the
same time.

ON COBBLERS AND GENERALS
How to Cultivate Quiet Kids in a World
That Can’t Hear Them
With anything young and tender the most
important part of the task is the begin-
ning of it; for that is the time at which
the character is being formed and the de-
sired impression more readily taken.
—PLATO, THE REPUBLIC
Mark Twain once told a story about a
man who scoured the planet looking for
the greatest general who ever lived.
When the man was informed that the
person he sought had already died and
gone to heaven, he made a trip to the
Pearly Gates to look for him. Saint
Peter pointed at a regular-looking Joe.
“That isn’t the greatest of all gener-
als,” protested the man. “I knew that
person when he lived on Earth, and he
was only a cobbler.”
“I know that,” said Saint Peter, “but
if he had been a general, he would have
been the greatest of them all.”
We should all look out for cobblers
who might have been great generals.
Which means focusing on introverted
children, whose talents are too often
stifled, whether at home, at school, or
on the playground.
Consider this cautionary tale, told to
me by Dr. Jerry Miller, a child psycho-
logist and the director of the Center for
the
Child
and
the
Family
at
the
University of Michigan. Dr. Miller had a
patient named Ethan, whose parents
brought
him
for
treatment
on
four
684/929
separate occasions. Each time, the par-
ents
voiced
the
same
fears
that
something was wrong with their child.
Each time, Dr. Miller assured them that
Ethan was perfectly fine.
The reason for their initial concern
was simple enough. Ethan was seven,
and
his
four-year-old
brother
had
beaten him up several times. Ethan
didn’t fight back. His parents—both of
them outgoing, take-charge types with
high-powered corporate jobs and a pas-
sion
for
competitive
golf
and
ten-
nis—were OK with their younger son’s
aggression, but worried that Ethan’s
passivity was “going to be the story of
his life.”
As Ethan grew older, his parents tried
in vain to instill “fighting spirit” in him.
They sent him onto the baseball dia-
mond and the soccer field, but Ethan
just wanted to go home and read. He
685/929
wasn’t
even
competitive
at
school.
Though very bright, he was a B student.
He could have done better, but pre-
ferred to focus on his hobbies, espe-
cially building model cars. He had a
few close friends, but was never in the
thick of classroom social life. Unable to
account
for
his
puzzling
behavior,
Ethan’s parents thought he might be
depressed.
But Ethan’s problem, says Dr. Miller,
was not depression but a classic case of
poor “parent-child fit.” Ethan was tall,
skinny, and unathletic; he looked like a
stereotypical nerd. His parents were so-
ciable, assertive people, who were “al-
ways smiling, always talking to people
while
dragging
Ethan
along
behind
them.”
Compare their worries about Ethan
to Dr. Miller’s assessment: “He was like
the classic Harry Potter kid—he was
686/929
always reading,” says Dr. Miller enthu-
siastically. “He enjoyed any form of
imaginative play. He loved to build
things. He had so many things he
wanted to tell you about. He had more
acceptance of his parents than they had
of him. He didn’t define them as patho-
logical, just as different from himself.
That same kid in a different home
would be a model child.”
But Ethan’s own parents never found
a way to see him in that light. The last
thing Dr. Miller heard was that his par-
ents finally consulted with another psy-
chologist who agreed to “treat” their
son. And now Dr. Miller is the one
who’s worried about Ethan.
“This is a clear case of an ‘iatrogenic’
problem,’ ” he says. “That’s when the
treatment makes you sick. The classic
example is when you use treatment to
try to make a gay child into a straight
687/929
one. I worry for that kid. These parents
are
very
caring
and
well-meaning
people. They feel that without treat-
ment, they’re not preparing their son
for society. That he needs more fire in
him. Maybe there’s truth to that last
part; I don’t know. But whether there is
or not, I firmly believe that it’s im-
possible to change that kid. I worry that
they’re taking a perfectly healthy boy
and damaging his sense of self.”
Of course, it doesn’t have to be a bad
fit when extroverted parents have an
introverted child. With a little mindful-
ness and understanding, any parent can
have a good fit with any kind of child,
says Dr. Miller. But parents need to step
back from their own preferences and
see what the world looks like to their
quiet children.
688/929
Take the case of Joyce and her seven-
year-old daughter, Isabel. Isabel is an
elfin second grader who likes to wear
glittery
sandals
and
colorful
rubber
bracelets snaking up her skinny arms.
She has several best friends with whom
she exchanges confidences, and she gets
along with most of the kids in her class.
She’s
the
type
to
throw
her
arms
around a classmate who’s had a bad
day;
she
even
gives
her
birthday
presents away to charity. That’s why
her mother, Joyce, an attractive, good-
natured woman with a wisecracking
sense of humor and a bring-it-on de-
meanor, was so confused by Isabel’s
problems at school.
In
first
grade,
Isabel
often
came
home consumed with worry over the
689/929
class bully, who hurled mean comments
at
anyone
sensitive
enough
to
feel
bruised by them. Even though the bully
usually picked on other kids, Isabel
spent hours dissecting the meaning of
the bully’s words, what her true inten-
tions had been, even what the bully
might be suffering at home that could
possibly motivate her to behave so
dreadfully at school.
By second grade, Isabel started ask-
ing her mother not to arrange play
dates without checking with her first.
Usually she preferred to stay home.
When Joyce picked up Isabel from
school, she often found the other girls
gathered into groups and Isabel off on
the playground, shooting baskets by
herself. “She just wasn’t in the mix. I
had to stop doing pickups for a while,”
recalls Joyce. “It was just too upsetting
for
me
to
watch.”
Joyce
couldn’t
690/929
understand
why
her
sweet,
loving
daughter wanted to spend so much
time alone. She worried that something
was wrong with Isabel. Despite what
she’d always thought about her daugh-
ter’s empathetic nature, might Isabel
lack the ability to relate with others?
It was only when I suggested that
Joyce’s daughter might be an introvert,
and
explained
what
that
was,
that
Joyce started thinking differently about
Isabel’s experiences at school. And from
Isabel’s perspective, things didn’t sound
alarming at all. “I need a break after
school,” she told me later. “School is
hard because a lot of people are in the
room, so you get tired. I freak out if my
mom plans a play date without telling
me, because I don’t want to hurt my
friends’ feelings. But I’d rather stay
home. At a friend’s house you have to
do the things other people want to do. I
691/929
like hanging out with my mom after
school because I can learn from her.
She’s been alive longer than me. We
have thoughtful conversations. I like
having
thoughtful
conversations
be-
cause they make people happy.”*
Isabel is telling us, in all her second-
grade wisdom, that introverts relate to
other people. Of course they do. They
just do it in their own way.
Now that Joyce understands Isabel’s
needs, mother and daughter brainstorm
happily, figuring out strategies to help
Isabel navigate her school day. “Before,
I would have had Isabel going out and
seeing people all the time, packing her
time after school full of activities,” says
Joyce. “Now I understand that it’s very
stressful for her to be in school, so we
figure out together how much socializ-
ing makes sense and when it should
happen.”
Joyce
doesn’t
mind
when
692/929
Isabel wants to hang out alone in her
room after school or leave a birthday
party a little earlier than the other kids.
She also understands that since Isabel
doesn’t see any of this as a problem,
there’s no reason that she should.
Joyce has also gained insight into
how to help her daughter manage play-
ground politics. Once, Isabel was wor-
ried about how to divide her time
among three friends who didn’t get
along with each other. “My initial in-
stinct,” says Joyce, “would be to say,
Don’t worry about it! Just play with them
all! But now I understand that Isabel’s a
different
kind
of
person.
She
has
trouble
strategizing
about
how
to
handle all these people simultaneously
on the playground. So we talk about
who she’s going to play with and when,
and we rehearse things she can tell her
friends to smooth the situation over.”
693/929
Another time, when Isabel was a
little older, she felt upset because her
friends sat at two different tables in the
lunch room. One table was populated
with her quieter friends, the other with
the class extroverts. Isabel described
the second group as “loud, talking all
the time, sitting on top of each oth-
er—ugh!” But she was sad because her
best friend Amanda loved to sit at the
“crazy table,” even though she was also
friends with the girls at the “more re-
laxed and chill table.” Isabel felt torn.
Where should she sit?
Joyce’s first thought was that the
“crazy table” sounded like more fun.
But she asked Isabel what she preferred.
Isabel thought for a minute and said,
“Maybe every now and then I’ll sit with
Amanda, but I do like being quieter and
taking
a
break
at
lunch
from
everything.”
694/929
Why would you want to do that?
thought Joyce. But she caught herself
before she said it out loud. “Sounds
good to me,” she told Isabel. “And
Amanda still loves you. She just really
likes that other table. But it doesn’t
mean she doesn’t like you. And you
should get yourself the peaceful time
you need.”
Understanding
introversion,
says
Joyce, has changed the way she par-
ents—and she can’t believe it took her
so long. “When I see Isabel being her
wonderful self, I value it even if the
world may tell her she should want to
be at that other table. In fact, looking
at that table through her eyes, it helps
me reflect on how I might be perceived
by others and how I need to be aware
and manage my extroverted ‘default’ so
as not to miss the company of others
like my sweet daughter.”
695/929
Joyce has also come to appreciate
Isabel’s sensitive ways. “Isabel is an old
soul,” she says. “You forget that she’s
only a child. When I talk to her, I’m not
tempted to use that special tone of
voice that people reserve for children,
and I don’t adapt my vocabulary. I talk
to her the way I would to any adult.
She’s very sensitive, very caring. She
worries about other people’s well-be-
ing. She can be easily overwhelmed,
but all these things go together and I
love this about my daughter.”
Joyce is as caring a mother as I’ve seen,
but she had a steep learning curve as
parent to her daughter because of their
difference in temperaments. Would she
have enjoyed a more natural parent-
696/929
child fit if she’d been an introvert her-
self? Not necessarily. Introverted par-
ents can face challenges of their own.
Sometimes painful childhood memories
can get in the way.
Emily Miller, a clinical social worker
in Ann Arbor, Michigan, told me about
a little girl she treated, Ava, whose shy-
ness was so extreme that it prevented
her from making friends or from con-
centrating in class. Recently she sobbed
when asked to join a group singing in
front of the classroom, and her mother,
Sarah, decided to seek Miller’s help.
When Miller asked Sarah, a successful
business journalist, to act as a partner
in Ava’s treatment, Sarah burst into
tears. She’d been a shy child, too, and
felt guilty that she’d passed on to Ava
her terrible burden.
“I hide it better now, but I’m still just
like my daughter,” she explained. “I
697/929
can approach anyone, but only as long
as I’m behind a journalist’s notebook.”
Sarah’s reaction is not unusual for
the pseudo-extrovert parent of a shy
child, says Miller. Not only is Sarah re-
living her own childhood, but she’s pro-
jecting onto Ava the worst of her own
memories. But Sarah needs to under-
stand that she and Ava are not the
same person, even if they do seem to
have inherited similar temperaments.
For one thing, Ava is influenced by her
father, too, and by any number of en-
vironmental factors, so her tempera-
ment is bound to have a different ex-
pression. Sarah’s own distress need not
be her daughter’s, and it does Ava a
great disservice to assume that it will
be. With the right guidance, Ava may
get to the point where her shyness is
nothing more than a small and infre-
quent annoyance.
698/929
But even parents who still have work
to do on their own self-esteem can be
enormously helpful to their kids, ac-
cording to Miller. Advice from a parent
who appreciates how a child feels is in-
herently
validating.
If
your
son
is
nervous on the first day of school, it
helps to tell him that you felt the same
way when you started school and still
do sometimes at work, but that it gets
easier with time. Even if he doesn’t be-
lieve you, you’ll signal that you under-
stand and accept him.
You can also use your empathy to
help you judge when to encourage him
to face his fears, and when this would
be
too
overwhelming.
For
example,
Sarah might know that singing in front
of the classroom really is too big a step
to ask Ava to take all at once. But she
might also sense that singing in private
with a small and simpatico group, or
699/929
with one trusted friend, is a manage-
able first step, even if Ava protests at
first. She can, in other words, sense
when to push Ava, and how much.
The psychologist Elaine Aron, whose
work
on
sensitivity
I
described
in
chapter
6,
offers
insight
into
these
questions when she writes about Jim,
one of the best fathers she knows. Jim
is a carefree extrovert with two young
daughters. The first daughter, Betsy, is
just like him, but the second daughter,
Lily,
is more
sensitive—a
keen
but
anxious observer of her world. Jim is a
friend of Aron’s, so he knew all about
sensitivity and introversion. He em-
braced Lily’s way of being, but at the
700/929
same time he didn’t want her to grow
up shy.
So, writes Aron, he “became determ-
ined to introduce her to every poten-
tially pleasurable opportunity in life,
from ocean waves, tree climbing, and
new foods to family reunions, soccer,
and varying her clothes rather than
wearing one comfortable uniform. In
almost
every
instance,
Lily
initially
thought these novel experiences were
not such good ideas, and Jim always re-
spected her opinion. He never forced
her, although he could be very persuas-
ive. He simply shared his view of a situ-
ation with her—the safety and pleas-
ures involved, the similarities to things
she already liked. He would wait for
that little gleam in her eye that said she
wanted to join in with the others, even
if she couldn’t yet.
701/929
“Jim always assessed these situations
carefully to ensure that she would not
ultimately be frightened, but rather be
able to experience pleasure and success.
Sometimes he held her back until she
was overly ready. Above all, he kept it
an
internal
conflict,
not
a
conflict
between him and her.… And if she or
anyone else comments on her quietness
or hesitancy, Jim’s prompt reply is,
‘That’s just your style. Other people
have different styles. But this is yours.
You like to take your time and be sure.’
Jim also knows that part of her style is
befriending anyone whom others tease,
doing careful work, noticing everything
going on in the family, and being the
best soccer strategist in her league.”
One of the best things you can do for
an introverted child is to work with
him on his reaction to novelty. Remem-
ber that introverts react not only to
702/929
new people, but also to new places and
events. So don’t mistake your child’s
caution in new situations for an inabil-
ity to relate to others. He’s recoiling
from novelty or overstimulation, not from
human contact. As we saw in the last
chapter,
introversion-extroversion
levels are not correlated with either
agreeableness or the enjoyment of in-
timacy. Introverts are just as likely as
the next kid to seek others’ company,
though often in smaller doses.
The key is to expose your child
gradually
to
new
situations
and
people—taking care to respect his lim-
its, even when they seem extreme. This
produces
more-confident
kids
than
either overprotection or pushing too
hard. Let him know that his feelings are
normal
and
natural,
but
also
that
there’s nothing to be afraid of: “I know
it can feel funny to play with someone
703/929
you’ve never met, but I bet that boy
would love to play trucks with you if
you asked him.” Go at your child’s
pace; don’t rush him. If he’s young,
make the initial introductions with the
other little boy if you have to. And stick
around in the background—or, when
he’s really little, with a gentle, support-
ive hand on his back—for as long as he
seems to benefit from your presence.
When he takes social risks, let him
know you admire his efforts: “I saw you
go up to those new kids yesterday. I
know that can be difficult, and I’m
proud of you.”
The same goes for new situations.
Imagine a child who’s more afraid of
the ocean than are other kids the same
age. Thoughtful parents recognize that
this fear is natural and even wise; the
ocean is indeed dangerous. But they
don’t allow her to spend the summer on
704/929
the safety of the dunes, and neither do
they drop her in the water and expect
her to swim. Instead they signal that
they understand her unease, while ur-
ging her to take small steps. Maybe
they play in the sand for a few days
with the ocean waves crashing at a safe
distance. Then one day they approach
the water’s edge, perhaps with the child
riding on a parent’s shoulders. They
wait for calm weather, or low tide, to
immerse a toe, then a foot, then a knee.
They don’t rush; every small step is a
giant stride in a child’s world. When ul-
timately she learns to swim like a fish,
she has reached a crucial turning point
in her relationship not only with water
but also with fear.
Slowly your child will see that it’s
worth punching through her wall of
discomfort to get to the fun on the oth-
er side. She’ll learn how to do the
705/929
punching by herself. As Dr. Kenneth
Rubin, the director of the Center for
Children, Relationships and Culture at
the University of Maryland, writes, “If
you’re consistent in helping your young
child learn to regulate his or her emo-
tions and behaviors in soothing and
supportive ways, something rather ma-
gical will begin to happen: in time, you
might watch your daughter seem to be
silently reassuring herself: ‘Those kids
are having fun, I can go over there.’ He
or she is learning to self-regulate fear-
fulness and wariness.”
If you want your child to learn these
skills, don’t let her hear you call her
“shy”: she’ll believe the label and ex-
perience her nervousness as a fixed
trait rather than an emotion she can
control. She also knows full well that
“shy” is a negative word in our society.
706/929
Above all, do not shame her for her
shyness.
If you can, it’s best to teach your
child self-coaxing skills while he’s still
very young, when there’s less stigma
associated with social hesitancy. Be a
role model by greeting strangers in a
calm and friendly way, and by getting
together with your own friends. Simil-
arly, invite some of his classmates to
your house. Let him know gently that
when you’re together with others, it’s
not OK to whisper or tug at your pants
leg to communicate his needs; he needs
to speak up. Make sure that his social
encounters are pleasant by selecting
kids who aren’t overly aggressive and
playgroups that have a friendly feel to
them. Have your child play with young-
er kids if this gives him confidence,
older kids if they inspire him.
707/929
If he’s not clicking with a particular
child, don’t force it; you want most of
his early social experiences to be posit-
ive. Arrange for him to enter new social
situations
as
gradually
as
possible.
When you’re going to a birthday party,
for example, talk in advance about
what the party will be like and how the
child might greet her peers (“First I’ll
say ‘Happy birthday, Joey,’ and then I’ll
say ‘Hi, Sabrina.’). And make sure to
get there early. It’s much easier to be
one of the earlier guests, so your child
feels as if other people are joining him
in a space that he “owns,” rather than
having
to
break
into
a
preexisting
group.
Similarly, if your child is nervous be-
fore school starts for the year, bring
him to see his classroom and, ideally, to
meet the teacher one-on-one, as well as
other friendly-looking adults, such as
708/929
principals and guidance counselors, jan-
itors and cafeteria workers. You can be
subtle about this: “I’ve never seen your
new classroom, why don’t we drive by
and take a look?” Figure out together
where the bathroom is, what the policy
is for going there, the route from the
classroom to the cafeteria, and where
the school bus will pick him up at day’s
end. Arrange playdates during the sum-
mer with compatible kids from his
class.
You can also teach your child simple
social strategies to get him through un-
comfortable moments. Encourage him
to look confident even if he’s not feel-
ing it. Three simple reminders go a long
way: smile, stand up straight, and make
eye contact. Teach him to look for
friendly faces in a crowd. Bobby, a
three-year-old, didn’t like going to his
city preschool because at recess the
709/929
class
left
the
safe
confines
of
the
classroom and played on the roof with
the bigger kids in the older classes. He
felt so intimidated that he wanted to go
to school only on rainy days when
there was no roof time. His parents
helped him figure out which kids he
felt comfortable playing with, and to
understand that a noisy group of older
boys didn’t have to spoil his fun.
If you think that you’re not up to all
this, or that your child could use extra
practice, ask a pediatrician for help loc-
ating a social skills workshop in your
area. These workshops teach kids how
to enter groups, introduce themselves
to new peers, and read body language
and facial expressions. And they can
help your child navigate what for many
introverted kids is the trickiest part of
their social lives: the school day.
710/929
It’s a Tuesday morning in October, and
the fifth-grade class at a public school
in New York City is settling down for a
lesson on the three branches of Americ-
an
government.
The
kids
sit
cross-
legged on a rug in a brightly lit corner
of
the
room
while
their
teacher,
perched on a chair with a textbook in
her lap, takes a few minutes to explain
the basic concepts. Then it’s time for a
group activity applying the lesson.
“This classroom gets so messy after
lunch,”
says
the
teacher.
“There’s
bubble
gum under
the tables,
food
wrappers everywhere, and Cheese Nips
all over the floor. We don’t like our
room to be so messy, do we?”
The students shake their heads no.
711/929
“Today we’re going to do something
about this problem—together,” says the
teacher.
She
divides
the
class
into
three
groups of seven kids each: a legislative
group, tasked with enacting a law to
regulate lunchtime behavior; an execut-
ive group, which must decide how to
enforce the law; and a judicial branch,
which has to come up with a system for
adjudicating messy eaters.
The kids break excitedly into their
groups,
seating
themselves
in
three
large clusters. There’s no need to move
any furniture. Since so much of the cur-
riculum is designed for group work, the
classroom desks are already arranged in
pods of seven desks each. The room
erupts in a merry din. Some of the kids
who’d looked deathly bored during the
ten-minute lecture are now chattering
with their peers.
712/929
But not all of them. When you see
the kids as one big mass, they look like
a room full of joyfully squirming pup-
pies. But when you focus on individual
children—like Maya, a redhead with a
ponytail, wire-rimmed glasses, and a
dreamy expression on her face—you
get a strikingly different picture.
In
Maya’s
group,
the
“executive
branch,” everyone is talking at once.
Maya hangs back. Samantha, tall and
plump in a purple T-shirt, takes charge.
She pulls a sandwich bag from her
knapsack and announces, “Whoever’s
holding the plastic bag gets to talk!”
The students pass around the bag, each
contributing a thought in turn. They re-
mind me of the kids in The Lord of the
Flies
civic-mindedly
passing
around
their conch shell, at least until all hell
breaks loose.
713/929
Maya looks overwhelmed when the
bag makes its way to her.
“I agree,” she says, handing it like a
hot potato to the next person.
The
bag
circles
the
table
several
times. Each time Maya passes it to her
neighbor, saying nothing. Finally the
discussion
is
done.
Maya
looks
troubled. She’s embarrassed, I’m guess-
ing, that she hasn’t participated. Sam-
antha reads from her notebook a list of
enforcement
mechanisms
that
the
group has brainstormed.
“Rule Number 1,” she says. “If you
break the laws, you miss recess.…”
“Wait!” interrupts Maya. “I have an
idea!”
“Go ahead,” says Samantha, a little
impatiently. But Maya, who like many
sensitive introverts seems attuned to
the subtlest cues for disapproval, no-
tices the sharpness in Samantha’s voice.
714/929
She opens her mouth to speak, but
lowers
her
eyes,
only
managing
something rambling and unintelligible.
No one can hear her. No one tries. The
cool
girl
in
the
group—light-years
ahead of the rest in her slinkiness and
fashion-forward clothes—sighs dramat-
ically. Maya peters off in confusion,
and the cool girl says, “OK, Samantha,
you can keep reading the rules now.”
The
teacher
asks
the
executive
branch for a recap of its work. Every-
one vies for airtime. Everyone except
Maya. Samantha takes charge as usual,
her voice carrying over everyone else’s,
until the rest of the group falls silent.
Her report doesn’t make a lot of sense,
but she’s so confident and good-natured
that it doesn’t seem to matter.
Maya, for her part, sits curled up at
the periphery of the group, writing her
name
over
and
over
again
in
her
715/929
notebook, in big block letters, as if to
reassert her identity. At least to herself.
Earlier, Maya’s teacher had told me
that she’s an intellectually alive student
who shines in her essay-writing. She’s a
gifted softball player. And she’s kind to
others, offering to tutor other children
who lag behind academically. But none
of Maya’s positive attributes were evid-
ent that morning.
Any parent would be dismayed to think
that this was their child’s experience of
learning, of socializing, and of herself.
Maya is an introvert; she is out of her
element in a noisy and overstimulating
classroom where lessons are taught in
large groups. Her teacher told me that
she’d do much better in a school with a
716/929
calm atmosphere where she could work
with other kids who are “equally hard-
working and attentive to detail,” and
where a larger portion of the day would
involve independent work. Maya needs
to learn to assert herself in groups, of
course, but will experiences like the
one I witnessed teach her this skill?
The truth is that many schools are
designed for extroverts. Introverts need
different kinds of instruction from ex-
troverts, write College of William and
Mary education scholars Jill Burruss
and Lisa Kaenzig. And too often, “very
little is made available to that learner
except constant advice on becoming
more social and gregarious.”
We tend to forget that there’s nothing
sacrosanct
about
learning
in
large
group classrooms, and that we organize
students this way not because it’s the
best way to learn but because it’s cost-
717/929
efficient, and what else would we do
with our children while the grown-ups
are at work? If your child prefers to
work autonomously and socialize one-
on-one, there’s nothing wrong with her;
she just happens not to fit the prevail-
ing
model.
The
purpose
of
school
should be to prepare kids for the rest of
their lives, but too often what kids need
to be prepared for is surviving the
school day itself.
The
school
environment
can
be
highly unnatural, especially from the
perspective of an introverted child who
loves to work intensely on projects he
cares about, and hang out with one or
two friends at a time. In the morning,
the door to the bus opens and dis-
charges its occupants in a noisy, jost-
ling mass. Academic classes are domin-
ated by group discussions in which a
teacher prods him to speak up. He eats
718/929
lunch in the cacophonous din of the
cafeteria, where he has to jockey for a
place at a crowded table. Worst of all,
there’s little time to think or create.
The structure of the day is almost guar-
anteed to sap his energy rather than
stimulate it.
Why do we accept this one-size-fits-
all situation as a given when we know
perfectly well that adults don’t organize
themselves this way? We often marvel
at how introverted, geeky kids “blos-
som” into secure and happy adults. We
liken it to a metamorphosis. However,
maybe it’s not the children who change
but their environments. As adults, they
get to select the careers, spouses, and
social circles that suit them. They don’t
have to live in whatever culture they’re
plunked into. Research from a field
known
as
“person-environment
fit”
shows that people flourish when, in the
719/929
words
of
psychologist
Brian
Little,
they’re “engaged in occupations, roles
or settings that are concordant with
their personalities.” The inverse is also
true: kids stop learning when they feel
emotionally threatened.
No
one
knows
this
better
than
LouAnne
Johnson,
a
tough-talking
former
marine
and
schoolteacher
widely recognized for educating some
of the most troubled teens in the Cali-
fornia public school system (Michelle
Pfeiffer played her in the movie Danger-
ous Minds). I visited Johnson at her
home in Truth or Consequences, New
Mexico, to find out more about her ex-
perience teaching children of all stripes.
Johnson happens to be skilled at
working with very shy children—which
is no accident. One of her techniques is
to share with her students how timid
she herself used to be. Her earliest
720/929
school memory is of being made to
stand on a stool in kindergarten be-
cause she preferred to sit in the corner
and read books, and the teacher wanted
her to “interact.” “Many shy children
are thrilled to discover that their teach-
er had been as shy as they were,” she
told me. “I remember one very shy girl
in my high school English class whose
mother
thanked
me
for
telling
her
daughter that I believed she would
peak much later in life, so not to worry
that she didn’t shine in high school. She
said that one comment had changed
her daughter’s entire outlook on life.
Imagine—one offhand comment made
such an impact on a tender child.”
When encouraging shy children to
speak, says Johnson, it helps to make
the topic so compelling that they forget
their inhibitions. She advises asking
students to discuss hot-button subjects
721/929
like “Boys have life a lot easier than
girls do.” Johnson, who is a frequent
public speaker on education despite a
lifelong public speaking phobia, knows
firsthand
how
well
this
works.
“I
haven’t
overcome
my
shyness,”
she
says. “It is sitting in the corner, calling
to me. But I am passionate about chan-
ging our schools, so my passion over-
comes my shyness once I get started on
a speech. If you find something that
arouses your passion or provides a wel-
come challenge, you forget yourself for
a
while.
It’s
like
an
emotional
vacation.”
But don’t risk having children make a
speech
to
the
class
unless
you’ve
provided them with the tools to know
with reasonable confidence that it will
go well. Have kids practice with a part-
ner and in small groups, and if they’re
still too terrified, don’t force it. Experts
722/929
believe that negative public speaking
experiences in childhood can leave chil-
dren
with
a
lifelong
terror
of
the
podium.
So, what kind of school environment
would work best for the Mayas of the
world?
First,
some
thoughts
for
teachers:
• Don’t think of introversion as
something
that
needs
to
be
cured. If an introverted child
needs help with social skills,
teach her or recommend train-
ing outside class, just as you’d
do for a student who needs ex-
tra attention in math or reading.
But celebrate these kids for who
they are. “The typical comment
on many children’s report cards
is, ‘I wish Molly would talk
more in class,’ ” Pat Adams, the
723/929
former
head
of
the
Emerson
School for gifted students in
Ann Arbor, Michigan, told me.
“But here we have an under-
standing that many kids are in-
trospective.
We
try
to
bring
them out, but we don’t make it
a big deal. We think about in-
troverted kids as having a dif-
ferent learning style.”
• Studies show that one third to
one half of us are introverts.
This means that you have more
introverted kids in your class
than you think. Even at a young
age, some introverts become ad-
ept at acting like extroverts,
making it tough to spot them.
Balance
teaching
methods
to
serve all the kids in your class.
Extroverts
tend
to
like
724/929
movement, stimulation, collab-
orative work. Introverts prefer
lectures, downtime, and inde-
pendent
projects.
Mix
it
up
fairly.
• Introverts often have one or two
deep interests that are not ne-
cessarily shared by their peers.
Sometimes they’re made to feel
freaky for the force of these pas-
sions, when in fact studies show
that this sort of intensity is a
prerequisite to talent develop-
ment. Praise these kids for their
interests, encourage them, and
help
them
find
like-minded
friends, if not in the classroom,
then outside it.
• Some collaborative work is fine
for introverts, even beneficial.
725/929
But it should take place in small
groups—pairs
or
three-
somes—and be carefully struc-
tured so that each child knows
her role. Roger Johnson, co-dir-
ector of the Cooperative Learn-
ing Center at the University of
Minnesota, says that shy or in-
troverted kids benefit especially
from well-managed small-group
work because “they are usually
very comfortable talking with
one or two of their classmates
to answer a question or com-
plete a task, but would never
think of raising their hand and
addressing the whole class. It is
very important that these stu-
dents get a chance to translate
their thoughts into language.”
Imagine how different Maya’s
experience would have been if
726/929
her group had been smaller and
someone had taken the time to
say,
“Samantha,
you’re
in
charge of keeping the discussion
on track. Maya, your job is to
take notes and read them back
to the group.”
• On the other hand, remember
Anders Ericsson’s research on
Deliberate Practice from chapter
3. In many fields, it’s impossible
to gain mastery without know-
ing how to work on one’s own.
Have your extroverted students
take a page from their introver-
ted peers’ playbooks. Teach all
kids to work independently.
• Don’t seat quiet kids in “high-
interaction”
areas
of
the
classroom, says communications
727/929
professor
James
McCroskey.
They won’t talk more in those
areas;
they’ll
feel
more
threatened
and
will
have
trouble concentrating. Make it
easy for introverted kids to par-
ticipate in class, but don’t insist.
“Forcing
highly
apprehensive
young people to perform orally
is harmful,” writes McCroskey.
“It will increase apprehension
and reduce self-esteem.”
• If your school has a selective
admissions policy, think twice
before basing your admissions
decisions on children’s perform-
ance
in
a
playgroup
setting.
Many introverted kids clam up
in groups of strangers, and you
will not get even a glimpse of
728/929
what these kids are like once
they’re relaxed and comfortable.
And here are some thoughts for par-
ents. If you’re lucky enough to have
control over where your child goes to
school, whether by scouting out a mag-
net school, moving to a neighborhood
whose public schools you like, or send-
ing your kids to private or parochial
school, you can look for a school that
• prizes independent interests and
emphasizes autonomy
• conducts
group
activities
in
moderation and in small, care-
fully managed groups
• values
kindness,
caring,
em-
pathy, good citizenship
• insists
on
orderly
classrooms
and hallways
729/929
• is organized into small, quiet
classes
• chooses teachers who seem to
understand the shy/serious/in-
troverted/sensitive
temperament
• focuses
its
academic/athletic/
extracurricular activities on sub-
jects that are particularly inter-
esting to your child
• strongly enforces an anti-bully-
ing program
• emphasizes a tolerant, down-to-
earth culture
• attracts like-minded peers, for
example
intellectual
kids,
or
artistic or athletic ones, depend-
ing on your child’s preference
Handpicking a school may be unreal-
istic for many families. But whatever
the school, there’s much you can do to
730/929
help your introverted child thrive. Fig-
ure out which subjects energize him
most, and let him run with them, either
with outside tutors, or extra program-
ming like science fairs or creative writ-
ing classes.
As for group activities,
coach him to look for comfortable roles
within larger groups. One of the ad-
vantages of group work, even for intro-
verts, is that it often offers many differ-
ent niches. Urge your child to take the
initiative, and claim for himself the re-
sponsibility of note-taker, picture-draw-
er, or whatever role interests him most.
Participation will feel more comfortable
when he knows what his contribution is
supposed to be.
You can also help him practice speak-
ing up. Let him know that it’s OK to
take his time to gather his thoughts be-
fore he speaks, even if it seems as if
everyone else is jumping into the fray.
731/929
At the same time, advise him that con-
tributing earlier in a discussion is a lot
easier than waiting until everyone else
has talked and letting the tension build
as he waits to take his turn. If he’s not
sure what to say, or is uncomfortable
making assertions, help him play to his
strengths. Does he tend to ask thought-
ful questions? Praise this quality, and
teach him that good questions are often
more useful than proposing answers.
Does he tend to look at things from his
own unique point of view? Teach him
how valuable this is, and discuss how
he might share his outlook with others.
Explore real-life scenarios: for ex-
ample, Maya’s parents could sit down
with her and figure out how she might
have handled the executive-group exer-
cise
differently.
Try
role-playing,
in
situations that are as specific as pos-
sible. Maya could rehearse in her own
732/929
words what it’s like to say “I’ll be the
note-taker!” or “What if we make a rule
that anyone who throws wrappers on
the floor has to spend the last ten
minutes of lunch picking up litter?”
The catch is that this depends on get-
ting Maya to open up and tell you what
happened during her school day. Even
if they’re generally forthcoming, many
kids won’t share experiences that made
them feel ashamed. The younger your
child is, the more likely she is to open
up, so you should start this process as
early in her school career as possible.
Ask your child for information in a
gentle, nonjudgmental way, with spe-
cific, clear questions. Instead of “How
was your day?” try “What did you do in
math class today?” Instead of “Do you
like your teacher?” ask “What do you
like about your teacher?” Or “What do
you not like so much?” Let her take her
733/929
time to answer. Try to avoid asking, in
the
overly
bright
voice
of
parents
everywhere,
“Did
you
have
fun
in
school today?!” She’ll sense how im-
portant it is that the answer be yes.
If she still doesn’t want to talk, wait
for her. Sometimes she’ll need to de-
compress for hours before she’s ready.
You may find that she’ll open up only
during
cozy,
relaxed
moments,
like
bathtime or bedtime. If that’s the case,
make sure to build these situations into
the day. And if she’ll talk to others, like
a trusted babysitter, aunt, or older sib-
ling, but not to you, swallow your pride
and enlist help.
Finally, try not to worry if all signs
suggest that your introverted child is
not the most popular kid at school. It’s
critically important for his emotional
and social development that he have
one
or
two
solid
friendships,
child
734/929
development experts tell us, but being
popular isn’t necessary. Many introver-
ted kids grow up to have excellent so-
cial skills, although they tend to join
groups in their own way—waiting a
while before they plunge in, or particip-
ating only for short periods. That’s OK.
Your child needs to acquire social skills
and make friends, not turn into the
most gregarious student in school. This
doesn’t mean that popularity isn’t a lot
of fun. You’ll probably wish it for him,
just as you might wish that he have
good looks, a quick wit, or athletic tal-
ent. But make sure you’re not imposing
your own longings, and remember that
there are many paths to a satisfying
life.
735/929
Many of those paths will be found in
passions outside the classroom. While
extroverts are more likely to skate from
one hobby or activity to another, intro-
verts often stick with their enthusiasms.
This gives them a major advantage as
they grow, because true self-esteem
comes from competence, not the other
way around. Researchers have found
that intense engagement in and com-
mitment to an activity is a proven route
to happiness and well-being. Well-de-
veloped talents and interests can be a
great source of confidence for your
child, no matter how different he might
feel from his peers.
For example, Maya, the girl who was
such a quiet member of the “executive
branch,” loves to go home every day
after school and read. But she also loves
softball, with all of its social and per-
formance pressures. She still recalls the
736/929
day she made the team after participat-
ing in tryouts. Maya was scared stiff,
but she also felt strong—capable of hit-
ting the ball with a good, powerful
whack. “I guess all those drills finally
paid off,” she reflected later. “I just
kept smiling. I was so excited and
proud—and that feeling never went
away.”
For parents, however, it’s not always
easy to orchestrate situations where
these deep feelings of satisfaction arise.
You might feel, for example, that you
should
encourage
your
introverted
child to play whichever sport is the
ticket to friendship and esteem in your
town. And that’s fine, if he enjoys that
sport and is good at it, as Maya is with
softball. Team sports can be a great
boon for anyone, especially for kids
who otherwise feel uncomfortable join-
ing groups. But let your child take the
737/929
lead in picking the activities he likes
best. He may not like any team sports,
and that’s OK. Help him look for activ-
ities where he’ll meet other kids, but
also have plenty of his own space. Cul-
tivate the strengths of his disposition. If
his passions seem too solitary for your
taste, remember that even solo activit-
ies like painting, engineering, or creat-
ive writing can lead to communities of
fellow enthusiasts.
“I have known children who found
others,” says Dr. Miller, “by sharing im-
portant interests: chess, elaborate role-
playing games, even discussing deep in-
terests like math or history.” Rebecca
Wallace-Segall, who teaches creative-
writing workshops for kids and teens as
director of Writopia Lab in New York
City, says that the students who sign up
for her classes “are often not the kids
who are willing to talk for hours about
738/929
fashion and celebrity. Those kids are
less likely to come, perhaps because
they’re less inclined to analyze and dig
deep—that’s not their comfort zone.
The so-called shy kids are often hungry
to brainstorm ideas, deconstruct them,
and act on them, and, paradoxically,
when they’re allowed to interact this
way, they’re not shy at all. They’re con-
necting with each other, but in a deep-
er zone, in a place that’s considered
boring or tiresome by some of their
peers.” And these kids do “come out”
when they’re ready; most of the Writo-
pia kids read their works at local book-
stores, and a staggering number win
prestigious
national
writing
competitions.
If your child is prone to overstimula-
tion, then it’s also a good idea for her
to pick activities like art or long-dis-
tance running, that depend less on
739/929
performing
under
pressure.
If
she’s
drawn to activities that require per-
formance, though, you can help her
thrive.
When I was a kid, I loved figure skat-
ing. I could spend hours on the rink,
tracing figure eights, spinning happily,
or flying through the air. But on the
day of my competitions, I was a wreck.
I hadn’t slept the night before and
would often fall during moves that I
had sailed through in practice. At first I
believed what people told me—that I
had the jitters, just like everybody else.
But then I saw a TV interview with the
Olympic gold medalist Katarina Witt.
She said that pre-competition nerves
gave her the adrenaline she needed to
win the gold.
I knew then that Katarina and I were
utterly different creatures, but it took
me decades to figure out why. Her
740/929
nerves were so mild that they simply
energized her, while mine were con-
stricting enough to make me choke. At
the time, my very supportive mother
quizzed the other skating moms about
how their own daughters handled pre-
competition anxiety, and came back
with insights that she hoped would
make me feel better. Kristen’s nervous
too, she reported. Renée’s mom says she’s
scared the night before a competition. But
I knew Kristen and Renée well, and I
was
certain
that
they
weren’t
as
frightened as I was.
I think it might have helped if I’d un-
derstood myself better back then. If
you’re the parent of a would-be figure
skater, help her to accept that she has
heavy-duty jitters without giving her
the idea that they’re fatal to success.
What she’s most afraid of is failing pub-
licly. She needs to desensitize herself to
741/929
this fear by getting used to competing,
and even to failing. Encourage her to
enter low-stakes competitions far away
from home, where she feels anonymous
and no one will know if she falls. Make
sure she has rehearsed thoroughly. If
she’s planning to compete on an unfa-
miliar rink, try to have her practice
there a few times first. Talk about what
might go wrong and how to handle it:
OK, so what if you do fall and come in
last place, will life still go on? And help
her visualize what it will feel like to
perform her moves smoothly.
Unleashing a passion can transform a
life, not just for the space of time that
your child’s in elementary or middle or
high school, but way beyond. Consider
742/929
the story of David Weiss, a drummer
and music journalist. David is a good
example of someone who grew up feel-
ing like Charlie Brown and went on to
build a life of creativity, productivity,
and meaning. He loves his wife and
baby son. He relishes his work. He has
a wide and interesting circle of friends,
and lives in New York City, which he
considers the most vibrant place in the
world for a music enthusiast. If you
measure a life by the classic barometers
of love and work, then David is a blaz-
ing success.
But it wasn’t always clear, at least
not to David, that his life would unfold
as well as it did. As a kid, he was shy
and awkward. The things that inter-
ested him, music and writing, held no
value for the people who mattered most
back then: his peers. “People would al-
ways tell me, ‘These are the best years
743/929
of your life,’ ” he recalls. “And I would
think to myself, I hope not! I hated
school. I remember thinking, I’ve gotta
get out of here. I was in sixth grade
when Revenge of the Nerds came out,
and I looked like I stepped out of the
cast. I knew I was intelligent, but I
grew up in suburban Detroit, which is
like ninety-nine percent of the rest of
the country: if you’re a good-looking
person and an athlete, you’re not gonna
get hassled. But if you seem too smart,
that’s not something that kids respect
you for. They’re more likely to try and
beat you down for it. It was my best at-
tribute, and I definitely enjoyed using
it, but it was something you also had to
try and keep in check.”
So how did he get from there to
here? The key for David was playing
the drums. “At one point,” David says,
“I totally overcame all my childhood
744/929
stuff. And I know exactly how: I started
playing the drums. Drums are my muse.
They’re
my
Yoda.
When
I
was
in
middle school, the high school jazz
band came and performed for us, and I
thought that the coolest one by a long
shot was the kid playing the drum set.
To me, drummers were kind of like ath-
letes, but musical athletes, and I loved
music.”
At first, for David, drumming was
mostly
about
social
validation;
he
stopped getting kicked out of parties by
jocks twice his size. But soon it became
something much deeper: “I suddenly
realized this was a form of creative ex-
pression, and it totally blew my mind. I
was fifteen. That’s when I became com-
mitted to sticking with it. My entire life
changed because of my drums, and it
hasn’t stopped, to this day.”
745/929
David still remembers acutely what it
was like to be his nine-year-old self. “I
feel like I’m in touch with that person
today,” he says. “Whenever I’m doing
something that I think is cool, like if
I’m in New York City in a room full of
people,
interviewing
Alicia
Keys
or
something, I send a message back to
that person and let him know that
everything turned out OK. I feel like
when I was nine, I was receiving that
signal from the future, which is one of
the things that gave me the strength to
hang in there. I was able to create this
loop between who I am now and who I
was then.”
The
other
thing
that
gave
David
strength was his parents. They focused
less on developing his confidence than
on making sure that he found ways to
be productive. It didn’t matter what he
was interested in, so long as he pursued
746/929
it and enjoyed himself. His father was
an avid football fan, David recalls, but
“the last person to say, ‘How come
you’re not out on the football field?’ ”
For a while David took up piano, then
cello.
When
he
announced
that
he
wanted to switch to drumming, his par-
ents were surprised, but never wavered.
They embraced his new passion. It was
their way of embracing their son.
If David Weiss’s tale of transformation
resonates for you, there’s a good reas-
on. It’s a perfect example of what the
psychologist Dan McAdams calls a re-
demptive life story—and a sign of men-
tal health and well-being.
At the Foley Center for the Study of
Lives
at
Northwestern
University,
747/929
McAdams
studies
the
stories
that
people tell about themselves. We all
write our life stories as if we were nov-
elists, McAdams believes, with begin-
nings,
conflicts,
turning
points,
and
endings. And the way we characterize
our past setbacks profoundly influences
how satisfied we are with our current
lives. Unhappy people tend to see set-
backs as contaminants that ruined an
otherwise good thing (“I was never the
same again after my wife left me”),
while generative adults see them as
blessings in disguise (“The divorce was
the
most
painful
thing
that
ever
happened to me, but I’m so much hap-
pier with my new wife”). Those who
live the most fully realized lives—giv-
ing back to their families, societies, and
ultimately
themselves—tend
to
find
meaning in their obstacles. In a sense,
McAdams has breathed new life into
748/929
one of the great insights of Western
mythology: that where we stumble is
where our treasure lies.
For many introverts like David, ad-
olescence is the great stumbling place,
the dark and tangled thicket of low self-
esteem and social unease. In middle
and high school, the main currency is
vivacity and gregariousness; attributes
like depth and sensitivity don’t count
for much. But many introverts succeed
in composing life stories much like
David’s: our Charlie Brown moments
are the price we have to pay to bang
our drums happily through the decades.
* Some who read this book before publication
commented that the quote from Isabel couldn’t
possibly be accurate—“no second grader talks
that way!” But this is what she said.

CONCLUSION
Wonderland
Our culture made a virtue of living only
as extroverts. We discouraged the inner
journey, the quest for a center. So we lost
our center and have to find it again.
—ANAÏS NIN
Whether you’re an introvert yourself or
an extrovert who loves or works with
one, I hope you’ll benefit personally
from the insights in this book. Here is a
blueprint to take with you:
Love is essential; gregariousness is
optional.
Cherish
your
nearest
and
dearest. Work with colleagues you like
and respect. Scan new acquaintances
for those who might fall into the former
categories or whose company you enjoy
for its own sake. And don’t worry about
socializing with everyone else. Rela-
tionships make everyone happier, intro-
verts included, but think quality over
quantity.
The secret to life is to put yourself in
the
right
lighting.
For
some
it’s
a
Broadway spotlight; for others, a lamp-
lit desk. Use your natural powers—of
persistence, concentration, insight, and
sensitivity—to do work you love and
work
that
matters.
Solve
problems,
make art, think deeply.
Figure out what you are meant to
contribute to the world and make sure
you contribute it. If this requires public
speaking or networking or other activit-
ies that make you uncomfortable, do
them anyway. But accept that they’re
difficult, get the training you need to
751/929
make them easier, and reward yourself
when you’re done.
Quit your job as a TV anchor and get
a degree in library science. But if TV
anchoring is what you love, then create
an extroverted persona to get yourself
through the day. Here’s a rule of thumb
for networking events: one new honest-
to-goodness relationship is worth ten
fistfuls of business cards. Rush home af-
terward and kick back on your sofa.
Carve out restorative niches.
Respect your loved ones’ need for so-
cializing and your own for solitude
(and vice versa if you’re an extrovert).
Spend your free time the way you
like, not the way you think you’re sup-
posed to. Stay home on New Year’s Eve
if that’s what makes you happy. Skip
the committee meeting. Cross the street
to avoid making aimless chitchat with
random
acquaintances.
Read.
Cook.
752/929
Run. Write a story. Make a deal with
yourself that you’ll attend a set number
of social events in exchange for not
feeling guilty when you beg off.
If your children are quiet, help them
make peace with new situations and
new people, but otherwise let them be
themselves. Delight in the originality of
their minds. Take pride in the strength
of their consciences and the loyalty of
their friendships. Don’t expect them to
follow the gang. Encourage them to fol-
low their passions instead. Throw con-
fetti when they claim the fruits of those
passions, whether it’s on the drummer’s
throne, on the softball field, or on the
page.
If
you’re
a
teacher,
enjoy
your
gregarious and participatory students.
But don’t forget to cultivate the shy, the
gentle, the autonomous, the ones with
single-minded
enthusiasms
for
753/929
chemistry sets or parrot taxonomy or
nineteenth-century art. They are the
artists,
engineers,
and
thinkers
of
tomorrow.
If you’re a manager, remember that
one third to one half of your workforce
is probably introverted, whether they
appear that way or not. Think twice
about how you design your organiza-
tion’s office space. Don’t expect intro-
verts to get jazzed up about open office
plans or, for that matter, lunchtime
birthday parties or team-building re-
treats. Make the most of introverts’
strengths—these are the people who
can help you think deeply, strategize,
solve complex problems, and spot ca-
naries in your coal mine.
Also, remember the dangers of the
New Groupthink. If it’s creativity you’re
after, ask your employees to solve prob-
lems alone before sharing their ideas. If
754/929
you want the wisdom of the crowd,
gather it electronically, or in writing,
and make sure people can’t see each
other’s ideas until everyone’s had a
chance to contribute. Face-to-face con-
tact is important because it builds trust,
but group dynamics contain unavoid-
able impediments to creative thinking.
Arrange for people to interact one-on-
one and in small, casual groups. Don’t
mistake assertiveness or eloquence for
good ideas. If you have a proactive
work force (and I hope you do), re-
member that they may perform better
under an introverted leader than under
an extroverted or charismatic one.
Whoever you are, bear in mind that
appearance is not reality. Some people
act like extroverts, but the effort costs
them in energy, authenticity, and even
physical health. Others seem aloof or
self-contained,
but
their
inner
755/929
landscapes are rich and full of drama.
So the next time you see a person with
a composed face and a soft voice, re-
member that inside her mind she might
be solving an equation, composing a
sonnet, designing a hat. She might, that
is, be deploying the powers of quiet.
We know from myths and fairy tales
that there are many different kinds of
powers in this world. One child is given
a light saber, another a wizard’s educa-
tion. The trick is not to amass all the
different kinds of available power, but
to use well the kind you’ve been gran-
ted.
Introverts
are
offered
keys
to
private gardens full of riches. To pos-
sess such a key is to tumble like Alice
down her rabbit hole. She didn’t choose
to go to Wonderland—but she made of
it an adventure that was fresh and fant-
astic and very much her own.
756/929
Lewis Carroll was an introvert, too,
by the way. Without him, there would
be no Alice in Wonderland. And by now,
this shouldn’t surprise us.

A Note on the Dedication
My grandfather was a soft-spoken man
with sympathetic blue eyes, and a pas-
sion for books and ideas. He always
dressed in a suit, and had a courtly way
of exclaiming over whatever was ex-
claimable in people, especially in chil-
dren. In the Brooklyn neighborhood
where he served as a rabbi, the side-
walks were filled with men in black
hats, women in skirts that hid their
knees,
and
improbably
well-behaved
kids. On his way to synagogue, my
grandfather would greet the passersby,
gently praising this child’s brains, that
one’s height, the other’s command of
current events. Kids adored him, busi-
nessmen respected him, lost souls clung
to him.
But what he loved to do best was
read. In his small apartment, where as a
widower he’d lived alone for decades,
all the furniture had yielded its original
function to serve as a surface for piles
of
books:
gold-leafed
Hebrew
texts
jumbled together with Margaret At-
wood and Milan Kundera. My grand-
father would sit beneath a halo-shaped
fluorescent light at his tiny kitchen
table, sipping Lipton tea and snacking
on marble cake, a book propped open
on the white cotton tablecloth. In his
sermons, each a tapestry of ancient and
humanist thought, he’d share with his
congregation the fruits of that week’s
study. He was a shy person who had
trouble making eye contact with the
audience, but he was so bold in his
spiritual and intellectual explorations
that when he spoke the congregation
swelled to standing-room-only.
759/929
The rest of my family took its cue
from him. In our house, reading was
the
primary
group
activity.
On
Saturday afternoons we curled up with
our books in the den. It was the best of
both
worlds:
you
had
the
animal
warmth of your family right next to
you, but you also got to roam around
the adventure-land inside your own
head.
Yet as a preteen I began to wonder
whether all this reading had marked
me as “out of it,” a suspicion that
seemed confirmed when I went away to
summer camp at the age of ten and
watched as a girl with thick glasses and
a high forehead refused to put down
her book on the all-important first day
of camp and instantly became a pariah,
her days and nights a hell of social ex-
clusion. I longed to read, too, but left
my own paperbacks untouched in my
760/929
suitcase (though I felt guilty about this,
as if the books needed me and I was
forsaking them). I saw that the girl who
kept reading was considered bookish
and shy, the very things that I was, too,
and knew that I must hide.
After that summer, I felt less comfort-
able about my desire to be alone with a
book. In high school, in college, and as
a young lawyer, I tried to make myself
appear more extroverted and less egg-
heady than I truly was.
But as I grew older, I drew inspira-
tion from my grandfather’s example. He
was a quiet man, and a great one.
When he died at the age of ninety-four,
after sixty-two years at the pulpit, the
NYPD had to close the streets of his
neighborhood
to
accommodate
the
throngs of mourners. He would have
been surprised to know this. Today, I
761/929
think that one of the best things about
him was his humility.
This book is dedicated, with love, to
my childhood family. To my mother,
with her endless enthusiasm for quiet
kitchen-table chats; she gave us chil-
dren the gift of intimacy. I was so lucky
to have such a devoted mother. To my
father,
a
dedicated
physician
who
taught by example the joys of sitting for
hours at a desk, hunting for knowledge,
but who also came up for air to intro-
duce me to his favorite poems and sci-
ence experiments. To my brother and
sister,
who
share
to
this
day
the
warmth and affection of having grown
up in our small family and household
full of literature. To my grandmother,
for her pluck, grit, and caring.
And in memory of my grandfather,
who spoke so eloquently the language
of quiet.
762/929
A Note on the Words Introvert and
Extrovert
This book is about introversion as seen
from
a
cultural
point
of
view.
Its
primary concern is the age-old dicho-
tomy between the “man of action” and
the “man of contemplation,” and how
we could improve the world if only
there were a greater balance of power
between the two types. It focuses on
the person who recognizes him- or her-
self somewhere in the following con-
stellation of attributes: reflective, cereb-
ral,
bookish,
unassuming,
sensitive,
thoughtful,
serious,
contemplative,
subtle,
introspective,
inner-directed,
gentle, calm, modest, solitude-seeking,
shy, risk-averse, thin-skinned. Quiet is
also
about
this
person’s
opposite
number: the “man of action” who is
ebullient, expansive, sociable, gregari-
ous,
excitable,
dominant,
assertive,
active, risk-taking, thick-skinned, outer-
directed, lighthearted, bold, and com-
fortable in the spotlight.
These are broad categories, of course.
Few individuals identify fully with only
one or the other. But most of us recog-
nize these types immediately, because
they
play
meaningful
roles
in
our
culture.
Contemporary personality psycholo-
gists may have a conception of intro-
version and extroversion that differs
from the one I use in this book. Adher-
ents of the Big Five taxonomy often
view such characteristics as the tend-
ency to have a cerebral nature, a rich
inner life, a strong conscience, some de-
gree of anxiety (especially shyness),
and a risk-averse nature as belonging to
764/929
categories quite separate from introver-
sion. To them, these traits may fall un-
der “openness to experience,” “con-
scientiousness,” and “neuroticism.”
My use of the word introvert is delib-
erately broader, drawing on the in-
sights of Big Five psychology, but also
encompassing Jungian thinking on the
introvert’s inner world of “inexhaust-
ible charm” and subjective experience;
Jerome Kagan’s research on high react-
ivity and anxiety (see chapters 4 and
5); Elaine Aron’s work on sensory pro-
cessing sensitivity and its relationship
to conscientiousness,
intense feeling,
inner-directedness, and depth of pro-
cessing (see chapter 6); and various re-
search on the persistence and concen-
tration that introverts bring to problem-
solving, much of it summarized won-
derfully in Gerald Matthews’s work (see
chapter 7).
765/929
Indeed,
for
over
three
thousand
years, Western culture has linked the
qualities in the above constellations of
adjectives. As the anthropologist C. A.
Valentine once wrote:
Western cultural traditions include a
conception of individual variability
which
appears
to
be
old,
wide-
spread, and persistent. In popular
form this is the familiar notion of
the man of action, practical man,
realist, or sociable person as op-
posed to the thinker, dreamer, ideal-
ist,
or
shy
individual.
The
most
widely used labels associated with
this tradition are the type designa-
tions extrovert and introvert.
Valentine’s concept of introversion in-
cludes traits that contemporary psycho-
logy
would
classify
as
openness
to
766/929
experience (“thinker, dreamer”), con-
scientiousness
(“idealist”),
and
neur-
oticism (“shy individual”).
A long line of poets, scientists, and
philosophers have also tended to group
these traits together. All the way back
in Genesis, the earliest book of the
Bible, we had cerebral Jacob (a “quiet
man dwelling in tents” who later be-
comes
“Israel,”
meaning
one
who
wrestles inwardly with God) squaring
off in sibling rivalry with his brother,
the
swashbuckling
Esau
(a
“skillful
hunter” and “man of the field”). In clas-
sical antiquity, the physicians Hippo-
crates and Galen famously proposed
that
our
temperaments—and
des-
tinies—were a function of our bodily
fluids, with extra blood and “yellow
bile” making us sanguine or choleric
(stable or neurotic extroversion), and
an excess of phlegm and “black bile”
767/929
making us calm or melancholic (stable
or
neurotic
introversion).
Aristotle
noted that the melancholic tempera-
ment was associated with eminence in
philosophy, poetry, and the arts (today
we might classify this as openness to
experience).
The
seventeenth-century
English
poet
John
Milton
wrote
Il
Penseroso (“The Thinker”) and L’Allegro
(“The Merry One”), comparing “the
happy person” who frolics in the coun-
tryside and revels in the city with “the
thoughtful person” who walks meditat-
ively through the nighttime woods and
studies in a “lonely Towr.” (Again,
today the description of Il Penseroso
would apply not only to introversion
but also to openness to experience and
neuroticism.)
The
nineteenth-century
German
philosopher
Schopenhauer
contrasted “good-spirited” people (en-
ergetic, active, and easily bored) with
768/929
his preferred type, “intelligent people”
(sensitive, imaginative, and melanchol-
ic). “Mark this well, ye proud men of
action!” declared his countryman Hein-
rich Heine. “Ye are, after all, nothing
but unconscious instruments of the men
of thought.”
Because of this definitional complex-
ity, I originally planned to invent my
own terms for these constellations of
traits. I decided against this, again for
cultural reasons: the words introvert and
extrovert have the advantage of being
well known and highly evocative. Every
time I uttered them at a dinner party or
to a seatmate on an airplane, they eli-
cited a torrent of confessions and reflec-
tions. For similar reasons, I’ve used the
layperson’s spelling of extrovert rather
than the extravert one finds throughout
the research literature.

Acknowledgments
I could not have written Quiet without
the help of countless friends, family
members,
and
colleagues,
including:
Richard Pine, otherwise known (to me)
as Super-Agent RSP: the smartest, sav-
viest, and menschiest literary agent that
any writer could hope to work with.
Richard believed unswervingly in Quiet,
even before I did. Then he kept on be-
lieving, all the way through the five
years it took me to research and write
it. I consider him not only an agent but
a partner in my career. I also enjoyed
working
with
the
whole
team
at
InkWell Management, including Ethan
Bassoff, Lyndsey Blessing, and Charlie
Olsen.
At Crown Publishers, it has been my
privilege to work with the remarkable
Molly
Stern
and
her
all-star
team.
Rachel Klayman has got to be the most
brilliant and dedicated editor in the
business. She has been there at two in
the afternoon and at two in the morn-
ing, spotting flaws in my reasoning and
clunkers in my prose, and championing
this book indefatigably. I also appreci-
ate how generous Mary Choteborsky
and Jenna Ciongoli were with their ed-
itorial talents. And I was fortunate to
work with outside editor Peter Guz-
zardi, who has terrific instincts and a
knack for making criticism sound de-
lightful. My heartfelt thanks to all of
you. This book would be a shadow of
itself without your efforts.
Special thanks too to Rachel Rokicki
and Julie Cepler for the creativity and
enthusiasm they brought to the Quiet
771/929
cause. And thanks to Patty Berg, Mark
Birkey, Chris Brand, Stephanie Chan,
Tina Constable, Laura Duffy, Songhee
Kim, Kyle Kolker, Rachel Meier, Anns-
ley Rosner, and everyone else on the
team at Crown.
I have also been very lucky to work
with Joel Rickett, Kate Barker, and the
rest of the crackerjack group at Viking/
Penguin U.K.
The marvelous people at TED em-
braced
the
ideas
in
this
book
and
offered me a chance to talk about them
at the TED Long Beach conference in
2012. I am grateful to Chris Anderson,
Kelly Stoetzel, June Cohen, Tom Rielly,
Michael Glass, Nicholas Weinberg, and
the entire TED team.
Brian Little, whose work I profiled in
chapter 9, has become an extraordinary
mentor and friend. I met Brian early in
my research process, when I asked for
772/929
an interview. He gave me not only the
interview but also, over the years, my
own personal graduate seminar in per-
sonality psychology. I am proud to be
one of his many disciples and friends.
Elaine Aron, whose research I pro-
filed in chapter 6, inspired me with her
life’s work and gave generously of her
time, knowledge, and life story.
I relied on the support and advice of
innumerable friends, including: Marci
Alboher, Gina Bianchini, Tara Bracco,

Special thanks and love to Al and
Bobbi Cain, who lent me their advice,
contacts, and professional counsel as I
researched and wrote, and who con-

will be as devoted and supportive an
in-law to some young person as they
are to me.
And to my beloved Gonzo (a.k.a.
Ken), who may just be the most gener-
ous person on earth, and the most dash-
ing. During the years I wrote this book,
he edited my drafts, sharpened my
ideas, made me tea, made me laugh,
brought
me
chocolate,
seeded
our
garden, turned his world upside down
so I had time to write, kept our lives
colorful and exciting, and got us the
hell out of the Berkshires. He also, of
course, gave us Sammy and Elishku,
who have filled our house with trucks
and our hearts with love.

Notes
INTRODUCTION: THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF
TEMPERAMENT
1.
Montgomery,
Alabama.
December
1,
1955: For an excellent biography of Rosa
Parks, see Douglas Brinkley, Rosa Parks: A
Life (New York: Penguin, 2000). Most of
the material in Quiet about Parks is drawn
from this work.
A note about Parks: Some have ques-
tioned the singularity of her actions, point-
ing out that she’d had plenty of civil rights
training before boarding that bus. While
this is true, there’s no evidence, according
to Brinkley, that Parks acted in a premedit-
ated manner that evening, or even as an
activist; she was simply being herself. More
important
for
Quiet’s
purposes,
her
personality did not prevent her from being
powerful; on the contrary, it made her a
natural at nonviolent resistance.
2. “north and south of temperament”: Wini-
fred Gallagher (quoting J. D. Higley), “How
We Become What We Are,” The Atlantic
Monthly, September 1994. (Higley was talk-
ing about boldness and inhibition, not ex-
troversion and introversion per se, but the
concepts overlap in many ways.)
3. governs how likely we are to exercise:

Arousal:

8. be a good leader: See chapter 2.
9. and ask “what if”: See chapters 3 and 7.
10. exhaustively researched subjects: As of
May 2, 2010, in the PSYCINFO database,
there were 9,194 entries on “extraversion,”
6,111 on “introversion,” and 12,494 on the
overlapping subject of “neuroticism.” There
were fewer entries for the other “Big 5”
personality traits: openness to experience,
conscientiousness, and agreeableness. Sim-
ilarly, as of June 14, 2010, a Google schol-
ar search found about 64,700 articles on
“extraversion,” 30,600 on “extroversion,”
55,900 on “introversion,” and 53,300 on
“neuroticism.”
The
psychologist
William
783/929
Graziano, in an e-mail dated July 31, 2010,
refers to introversion/extroversion as “the
300 lb. gorilla of personality, meaning that
it is big and cannot be ignored easily.”
11. in the Bible: See “A Note on Terminology.”

some
evolutionary
psychologists: See
chapter 6.
13. one third to one half of Americans are
introverts: Rowan Bayne, in The Myers-
Briggs Type Indicator: A Critical Review and
Practical Guide (London: Chapman and Hall,
1995), 47, finds the incidence of introver-
sion at 36 percent, which is in turn determ-
ined from Isabel Myers’s own study from
1985. A more recent study, published by
the Center for Applications of Psychological
Type Research Services in 1996, sampled
914,219 people and found that 49.3 per-
cent were extroverts and 50.7 percent were
introverts. See “Estimated Frequencies of
the Types in the United States Population,”
784/929
a brochure published by the Center for Ap-
plication of Psychological Type (CAPT) in
1996 and 2003. That the percentage of in-
troverts found by these studies rose from 36
percent to 50.7 percent doesn’t necessarily
mean that there are now more introverts in
the United States, according to CAPT. It
may be “simply a reflection of the popula-
tions sampled and included.” In fact, a
wholly separate survey, this one using the
Eysenck Personality Inventory and Eysenck
Personality Questionnaire rather than the
Myers-Briggs test, indicates that extraver-
sion scores have increased over time (from
1966 to 1993) for both men and women:
see Jean M. Twenge, “Birth Cohort Changes
in Extraversion: A Cross-Temporal Meta-
Analysis, 1966–1993,” Personality and Indi-
vidual Differences 30 (2001): 735–48.
14. United States is among the most extro-
verted of nations: This has been noted in
two studies: (1) Juri Allik and Robert R.
785/929
McCrae, “Toward a Geography of Personal-
ity Traits: Patterns of Profiles Across 36
Cultures,” Journal of Cross-Cultural Psycho-
logy 35 (2004): 13–28; and (2) Robert R.
McCrae and Antonio Terracciano, “Person-
ality Profiles of Cultures: Aggregate Person-
ality Traits,” Journal of Personality and So-
cial Psychology 89:3 (2005): 407–25.
15. Talkative people, for example: William B.
Swann Jr. and Peter J. Rentfrow, “Blirta-
tiousness:
Cognitive,
Behavioral,
and
Physiological
Consequences
of
Rapid
Responding,” Journal of Personality and So-
cial Psychology 81, no. 6 (2001): 1160–75.
16. Velocity of speech counts: Howard Giles
and Richard L. Street Jr., “Communicator
Characteristics and Behavior,” in M. L.
Knapp and G. R. Miller, eds., Handbook of
Interpersonal Communication, 2nd ed. (Thou-
sand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1994), 103–61. (But
note some good news for introverts: slow
786/929
speech can be perceived as honest and be-
nevolent, according to other studies.)
17. the voluble are considered smarter: Del-
roy L. Paulhus and Kathy L. Morgan, “Per-
ceptions

34. introverts and extroverts differ in the
level
of
outside
stimulation … Many
have a horror of small talk: See Part Two:
“Your Biology, Your Self?”
790/929
35. introvert is not a synonym for hermit: In-
troversion is also very different from Asper-
ger’s syndrome, the autism spectrum dis-
order that involves difficulties with social
interactions such as reading facial expres-
sions and body language. Introversion and
Asperger’s both can involve feeling over-
whelmed
in
social
settings.
But
unlike
people
with
Asperger’s,
introverts
often
have strong social skills. Compared with
the one third to one half of Americans who
are introverts, only one in five thousand
people has Asperger’s. See National Insti-
tute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,

dress this question. See, for example, Steph-

5. The word personality didn’t exist: Sus-
man, Culture as History, 277: The modern
idea of personality emerged in the early
twentieth century and came into its own

psychologist Gordon W. Allport, interest in
personality had reached “astonishing pro-
portions.” See also Sol Cohen, “The Mental

17. Americans became obsessed with movie
stars: In 1907 there were five thousand
movie theaters in the United States; by
1914
there
were
180,000
theaters
and
counting. The first films appeared in 1894,
and though the identities of screen actors
were originally kept secret by the film stu-
dios (in keeping with the ethos of a more
private era), by 1910 the notion of a
“movie star” was born. Between 1910 and
1915 the influential filmmaker D. W. Grif-
fith made movies in which he juxtaposed
797/929
close-ups of the stars with crowd scenes.
His message was clear: here was the suc-
cessful personality, standing out in all its
glory against the undifferentiated nobodies
of the world. Americans absorbed these
messages enthusiastically. The vast major-
ity of biographical profiles published in The
Saturday Evening Post and Collier’s at the
dawn of the twentieth century were about
politicians, businessmen, and professionals.
But by the 1920s and 1930s, most profiles
were written about entertainers like Gloria
Swanson and Charlie Chaplin. (See Susman

41. Even the Christianity of early American
religious revivals: Long before that silver-
804/929
tongued Chautauqua speaker turned Dale
Carnegie’s world upside down, religious re-
vivals were taking place under huge tents
all over the country. Chautauqua itself was
inspired by these “Great Awakenings,” the
first in the 1730s and 1740s, and the
second in the early decades of the nine-
teenth century. The Christianity on offer in
the Awakenings was new and theatrical; its
leaders
were
sales-oriented,
focused
on
packing followers under their great tents.
Ministers’ reputations depended on how ex-
uberant they were in speech and gesture.
The star system dominated Christianity
long before the concept of movie stars even
existed. The dominant evangelist of the
First Great Awakening was a British show-
man named George Whitefield who drew
standing-room-only crowds with his dra-
matic impersonations of biblical figures and
unabashed weeping, shouting, and crying
out. But where the First Great Awakening
805/929
balanced drama with intellect and gave
birth to universities like Princeton and
Dartmouth, the Second Great Awakening
was even more personality-driven; its lead-
ers focused purely on drawing crowds. Be-
lieving, as many megachurch pastors do
today,
that
too
academic
an
approach
would fail to pack tents, many evangelical
leaders gave up on intellectual values alto-
gether and embraced their roles as sales-
men
and
entertainers.
“My
theology!
I
didn’t know I had any!” exclaimed the
nineteenth-century evangelist D. L. Moody.
This kind of oratory affected not only
styles of worship, but also people’s ideas of
who Jesus was. A 1925 advertising execut-
ive named Bruce Fairchild Barton published
a book called The Man Nobody Knows. It
presented Jesus as a superstar sales guy
who “forged twelve men from the bottom
ranks of business into an organization that
conquered the world.” This Jesus was no
806/929
lamb; this was “the world’s greatest busi-
ness
executive”
and
“The
Founder
of
Modern Business.” The notion of Jesus as a
role model for business leadership fell on
extraordinarily
receptive
ears.
The
Man
Nobody Knows became one of the best-
selling nonfiction books of the twentieth
century, according to Powell’s Books. See

cial Anxiety Disorder)”: “The diagnosis is
appropriate only if the avoidance, fear, or
anxious anticipation of encountering the so-
cial or performance situation interferes sig-
nificantly with the person’s daily routine,
occupational functioning, or social life, or if
the person is markedly distressed about
having the phobia.… In feared social or
performance
situations,
individuals
with
Social Phobia experience concerns about
embarrassment and are afraid that others
809/929
will
judge
them
to
be
anxious,
weak,
‘crazy,’ or stupid. They may fear public
speaking because of concern that others
will notice their trembling hands or voice
or they may experience extreme anxiety
when conversing with others because of
fear that they will appear inarticulate.…
The fear or avoidance must interfere signi-
ficantly with the person’s normal routine,
occupational or academic functioning, or
social activities or relationships, or the per-
son must experience marked distress about
having the phobia. For example, a person
who is afraid of speaking in public would
not receive a diagnosis of Social Phobia if
this activity is not routinely encountered on
the job or in the classroom and the person
is not particularly distressed about it.”

19, 2009.
2. some $11 billion a year: Melanie Lindner,
“What People Are Still Willing to Pay For,”
Forbes, January 15, 2009. The $11 billion
figure is for 2008 and is, according to Mar-

5. superhuman physical size: Steve Salerno
made this point in his book Sham (New
York: Crown Publishers, 2005), 75. He also
made the later point about Robbins’s re-
mark that he was once so poor that he kept
his dishes in the bathtub.
6. Founded in 1908 … “educating leaders
who make a difference in the world”:
Harvard Business School website, Septem-

813/929
Stanford MBAs who graduated between
1961 and 1965, and published a series of
studies about them. He found that high
earners and general managers tended to be
outgoing and extroverted. See, e.g., Thomas

Csikszentmihalyi,
Creativity:
Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and In-
vention
(New
York:

ing a correlation between extroversion and
creativity, but in contrast to the studies by
MacKinnon,
Csikszentmihalyi,
and
Feist,
which followed people whose careers had
proven them to be exceptionally creative
“in real life,” these tend to be studies of col-
lege students measuring subjects’ creativity
in more casual ways, for example by ana-
lyzing their personal hobbies or by asking
them to play creativity games like writing a
827/929
story about a picture. It’s likely that extro-
verts would do better in high-arousal set-
tings like these. It’s also possible, as the
psychologist Uwe Wolfradt suggests, that
the relationship between introversion and
creativity is “discernable at a higher level
of creativity only.” (Uwe Wolfradt, “Indi-
vidual Differences in Creativity: Personal-

CHAPTER 4: IS TEMPERAMENT DESTINY?
A general note on this chapter: Chapter
4 discusses the psychologist Jerome Kagan’s
work on high reactivity, which some con-
temporary psychologists would consider to
lie at the intersection of introversion and
another trait known as “neuroticism.” For
the sake of readability, I have not elucid-
ated that distinction in the text.
1. For one of those studies, launched in
1989: This study is discussed at length in
Jerome Kagan and Nancy Snidman, The
Long Shadow of Temperament (Cambridge,
MA: Harvard University Press, 2004).

and extrovert”: Ibid., 218.

therapy and the Highly Sensitive Person (New

8. They literally use more eye movements:
Various
studies
have
documented
these
tendencies in high-reactive children. See,
for example, Jerome Kagan, “Reflection-
846/929
Impulsivity and Reading Ability in Primary
Grade Children,” Child Development 363, no.
3 (1965): 609–28. See also Ellen Siegelman,
“Reflective and Impulsive Observing Beha-
vior,” Child Development 40, no. 4 (1969):
1213–22. These studies use the term “re-
flective” rather than “high-reactive,” but
it’s a safe bet that they’re talking about the
same group of children.
Siegelman
de-
scribes them as “preferring low-risk situ-
ations generally but choosing harder, more
solitary intellectual tasks … less motoric-
ally active, and more cautious” (p. 1214).
(Similar studies have been done on adults;
see chapters 6 and 7.)

of personality associate empathy not with
sensitivity (a construct that is gaining at-
tention, but is relatively less well known
than the Big 5), but with a trait known as
“Agreeableness”
and
even
extroversion.
Aron’s work does not challenge these asso-

most valuable aspects of Aron’s work is

2. Financial history is full of examples:
There are also many examples from milit-
ary
history.
“Hurrah,
boys,
we’ve
got
them!” General Custer famously shouted at
the battle of Little Bighorn in 1876—just
before his entire unit of two hundred men
was wiped out by three thousand Sioux and
Cheyenne. General MacArthur advanced in
the face of repeated Chinese threats of at-
tack during the Korean War, costing almost
2 million lives with little strategic gain.
Stalin refused to believe that the Germans
would invade Russia in 1941, even after
ninety warnings of an impending attack. See

879/929

Monk, Fools Rush In: Steve Case, Jerry Levin,

4. They protect themselves better from the
downside:
The
psychology
professor
Richard Howard, in an interview with the
author on November 17, 2008, notes that
introverts tend to down-regulate positive
emotions and extroverts tend to up-regulate
them.
5. our limbic system: Note that these days
many scientists dislike the phrase “limbic
system.” This is because no one really
knows which parts of the brain this term
refers to. The brain areas included in this
system have changed over the years, and
today many use the term to mean brain
880/929
areas that have something to do with emo-
tion. Still, it’s a useful shorthand.

this sort of risk-taking behavior is in what
Daniel Nettle (Personality: What Makes You

conscientiousness is the better predictor.

36. If you force extroverts to pause … how to
behave around warning signals in the
future: Interview with the author, Novem-
ber 13, 2008. Another way to understand
why some people worry about risks and
others ignore them is to go back to the idea
of brain networks. In this chapter I focused
890/929
on the dopamine-driven reward system and
its role in delivering life’s goodies. But
there’s a mirror-image brain network, often
called the loss avoidance system, whose job
is to call our attention to risk. If the reward
network chases shiny fruit, the loss avoid-
ance system worries about bad apples.
The loss avoidance system, like the re-
ward network, is a double-edged sword. It
can
make
people
anxious,
unpleasantly
anxious, so anxious that they sit out bull
markets while everyone else gets rich. But
it also causes them to take fewer stupid
risks. This system is mediated in part by a
neurotransmitter
called
serotonin—and
when people are given drugs like Prozac
(known as selective serotonin reuptake in-
hibitors) that affect the loss avoidance sys-
tem, they become more blasé about danger.
They also become more gregarious. These
features coincide uncannily, points out the
neurofinance expert Dr. Richard Peterson,
891/929
with the behavior of irrationally exuberant
investors. “The characteristics of decreased
threat perception and increased social affili-
ation [resulting from drugs like Prozac]
mirror the decreased risk perception and
herding of excessively bullish investors,” he
writes. “It is as if bubble investors are ex-
periencing a partial deactivation of their
brains’ loss avoidance systems.”

3. Walter Mischel: For an overview of the
person-situation debate, see, for example,
David C. Funder, The Personality Puzzle
(New York: W. W. Norton, 2010), 118–44.
See also Walter Mischel and Yuichi Shoda,
“Reconciling
Processing
Dynamics
and
908/929
Personality Dispositions,” Annual Review of
Psychology 49 (1998): 229–58. In further
support of the premise that there truly is
such a thing as a fixed personality: We
know now that people who score as intro-
verts on personality tests tend to have dif-
ferent physiologies and probably inherit
some different genes from those who meas-
ure as extroverts. We also know that per-
sonality traits predict an impressive variety
of important life outcomes. If you’re an ex-
trovert, you’re more likely to have a wide
circle of friends, have risky sex, get into ac-
cidents, and excel at people-oriented work
like sales, human resources, and teaching.
(This doesn’t mean that you will do these
things—only that you’re more likely than
your typical introvert to do them.) If you’re
an introvert, you’re more likely to excel in
high school, in college, and in the land of
advanced degrees, to have smaller social
networks, to stay married to your original
909/929
partner, and to pursue autonomous work
like art, research, math, and engineering.
Extroversion and introversion even predict
the
psychological
challenges
you
might
face: depression and anxiety for introverts
(think Woody Allen); hostility, narcissism,
and overconfidence for extroverts (think
Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick, drunk with
rage against a white whale).
In addition, there are studies showing
that the personality of a seventy-year-old
can be predicted with remarkable accuracy
from early adulthood on. In other words,
despite the remarkable variety of situations
that we experience in a lifetime, our core
traits remain constant. It’s not that our per-
sonalities don’t evolve; Kagan’s research on
the malleability of high-reactive people has
singlehandedly disproved this notion. But
we tend to stick to predictable patterns. If
you were the tenth most introverted person
in your high school class, your behavior
910/929
may fluctuate over time, but you probably
still find yourself ranked around tenth at
your fiftieth reunion. At that class reunion,
you’ll also notice that many of your class-
mates will be more introverted than you re-
member them being in high school: quieter,
more self-contained, and less in need of ex-
citement. Also more emotionally stable,
agreeable, and conscientious. All of these
traits grow more pronounced with age. Psy-
chologists call this process “intrinsic matur-
ation,” and they’ve found these same pat-
terns of personality development in coun-
tries as diverse as Germany, the UK, Spain,
the Czech Republic, and Turkey. They’ve
also found them in chimps and monkeys.
This
makes
evolutionary
sense.
High
levels of extroversion probably help with
mating, which is why most of us are at our
most
sociable
during
our
teenage
and
young adult years. But when it comes to
keeping
marriages
stable
and
raising
911/929
children, having a restless desire to hit
every party in town may be less useful than
the urge to stay home and love the one
you’re with. Also, a certain degree of intro-
spection may help us age with equanimity.
If the task of the first half of life is to put
yourself out there, the task of the second
half is to make sense of where you’ve been.

and the Corres-

chologists have found that some people
who claim not to be shy in a written ques-
tionnaire are quite adept at concealing
those aspects of shyness that they can con-
trol consciously, such as talking to mem-
bers of the opposite sex and speaking for
long periods of time. But they often “leak”
their shyness unwittingly, with tense body
postures and facial expressions.

with
many
caring teachers, school administrators, and
child psychologists, and on the following
wonderful books:

Highly
Sensitive
Child: Helping Our Children Thrive
When the World Overwhelms Them
(New York: Broadway Books), 2002.

Kennedy-Moore, The Unwritten Rules
of Friendship (Boston: Little Brown,
2003).

1. Mark Twain once told a story: This comes
from Donald Mackinnon, who believed (but
was not 100 percent certain) that Mark
Twain
told
this
story.

MacKinnon, “The Nature and Nurture of
Creative
Talent,”
(Walter
Van
Dyke

New Haven, CT, April 11, 1962).

this
cautionary
tale … by
Dr.
Jerry
Miller: I conducted several in-person and e-
mail interviews with Dr. Miller between
2006 and 2010.
3. Emily Miller: I conducted several inter-
views with Emily Miller between 2006 and
2010.
4. Elaine Aron: Elaine N. Aron, Psychotherapy
and the Highly Sensitive Person (New York:
Routledge, 2010), 18–19.
5. Dr. Kenneth Rubin: Rubin, The Friendship
Factor.
6. “very little is made available to that
learner”: Jill D. Burruss and Lisa Kaenzig,
“Introversion: The Often Forgotten Factor
Impacting the Gifted,” Virginia Association
for the Gifted Newsletter 21, no. 1 (1999).
7. Experts believe that negative public

ently (Boston, MA: Harvard Business Press,

Myers et al., MBTI Manual: A Guide to the
Development and Use of the Myers-Briggs
Type Indicator, 3rd ed., 2nd printing (Palo
Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press,
1998), 261–62. See also Allen L. Hammer,

9. prerequisite to talent development: See
chapter 3, especially on the work of Anders

10. “they are usually very comfortable talk-
ing with one or two of their classmates”:
E-mail from Roger Johnson to the author,
June 14, 2010.
925/929
11. Don’t seat quiet kids in “high interac-
tion”
areas:
James
McCroskey,
“Quiet
Children in the Classroom: On Helping Not
Hurting,”
Communication
Education
29
(1980).
12. being popular isn’t necessary: Rubin, The
Friendship Factor: “Research findings do not
suggest that popularity is the golden route
to all manner of good things. There simply
is not much evidence that it guarantees so-
cial or academic success in adolescence,
young adulthood, or later life.… If your
child finds one other child to befriend, and
the pair clearly have fun together and enjoy
each other’s company and are supportive
companions, good for him. Stop worrying.
Not every child needs to be part of a big,
happy gang. Not every child needs many
friends; for some, one or two will do.”
13. intense engagement in and commitment
to an activity: I. McGregor and Brian
Little, “Personal Projects, Happiness, and
926/929
Meaning: On Doing Well and Being Your-
self,” Journal of Personality and Social Psy-
chology 74, no. 2 (1998): 494–512.
