Abstract: Social media is one of the most popular platformsand people from all the diverse fields such as students or professionals explore social media 
daily. It is a platform where people are available from different cultures and religions. With the advancement of technologies in every field of life, there is 
an increased demand for social media. Whenever people go online they generate rich data through their smartphones or internet pads. Their texting 
style, taste in music, books, likes, dislikes, sharing posts reveal their personality, therefore social media is an ideal platform to study the human 
personality. Personality has been considered as an essential factor and it is a combination of different attributes that make a person unique from one 
another. In our proposed work, we used Twitter data and myPersonality datasets to perform an objective assessment using a deep sequential neural 
network and multi-target regression model for predicting personality traits. The proposed algorithm is based on the Five-Factor Model (Openness, 
Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism). The efficacy of the proposed technique has been measured by MSE, MAE, Precision, 
Recall, and F1-Score. Experimental results show that our model is robust and ithas outperformed the existing techniques to predict human personality 
traits.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 The Five-Factor Model 
The Five-Factor model is one of the well-established 
models to recognize personality. It uses words to identify 
personality and analyze in which trait a person fits. It 
characterizes a person into five traits i-e agreeableness, 
conscientiousness, 
extraversion, 
neuroticism, 
and 
openness [1]. 
 
 
Fig. 1. Five-Factor Model attributes 
 
The Five-Factor model is also called the “BIG5” or “Ocean” 
model. According to Hirschfeld, the Five-Factor Model 
provides the prestigious dimensions of personality and the 
five traits of “FFM” or “Big Five” can be stated below: 
O- Openness:Openness is a dimension of the Five-Factor 
Model. Openness relates to an individual who is creative, 
imaginative, artistic, understanding, curious, politically 
liberal, traditional, competitors, and love to travel new 
places. They are successful if they pursue the field of an 
accountant, auditor, judge, and financial manager. 
C- 
Conscientiousness:Conscientiousness 
is 
another 
dimension or trait of the Five-Factor Model which has two 
basic features dependability and accomplishment. The 
highly conscientious people are well planned, organized, 
dutiful, reliable, purposeful, impulse control, workaholic, 
self-disciplined, determined, and confident. They tend to be 
less bound by plans and rules but more tolerant. 
E- Extraversion:Extroversion is a classic dimension of the 
Five-Factor Model. The highly extroverted people are 
affectionate, 
friendly, 
excitement 
seeker, 
energetic, 
assertive, optimistic, outgoing, charismatic, and talkative. 
Most of the extrovert gain energy from their surroundings. 
They become successful in the future if they pursue politics 
and sales as their career. 
A- Agreeableness:Agreeableness is a dimension that is 
concerned with the nature of one's associations with others. 
The highly agreeable people are cooperative, courteous, 
friendly, trustworthy, kind, tolerant, pardoning, polite nature, 
peacekeeper, calm, imaginative, caring, and raise new 
ideas. They ignore their needs for others, they are good 
team worker but don't work as a leader. They are easily 
influenced, 
adopt 
group 
opinions, 
working 
in 
the 
background, and keeping a positive relationship with others. 
N- Neuroticism:Neuroticism is another classic dimension of 
the Five-Factor Model and they are reversely referred to as 
“Emotional Stability”. The individuals who have a higher 
degree of neuroticism are equivalent to emotional 
uncertainty, pessimistic, sensitive, insecure, unstable, 
nervous, easily depressed, vulnerable, irritated, shocked 
easily, moody, experience negative emotions like (anxiety, 
anger, and depression) and never satisfied with their lives. 
They pursue pilot, engineering, and manager as their 
career.

Fig. 2.Emotions of the Big Five personality traits 
 
The four main researchers J. M. Digman, A. Comrey, Lewis 
Goldberg, and Dr. Naomi Takemoto-Chowk studied the 
existing personality test in a seminar that was conducted in 
Honolulu in 1981. They clinched that Norman's major five 
factors are the most promising traits of human personality. 
In the 1980s, the five-factor model was widely accepted by 
personality researchers. Peter Saville and his co-workers 
combined the five-factor model with OPQ i-e occupational, 
personality, and Questionnaire, and in 1985 McCrae and 
Costa followed the five-factor model as NEO i-e 
Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Openness [2]. Every 
individual is different from one another due to their unique 
psychological 
structure 
(thinking, 
behavior, 
and 
preferences). It is impossible to completely compare one 
person to another because every individual has specific 
traits of personality. It is true some traits resemble one 
another but not a complete personality resembles others. 
People are different from each other along with a similar set 
of traits [3]. It is a general desire to understand the 
personality of a person and a lot of research has 
beenperformed on the personality assessment. There are 
several models proposed to assess personalities like “MBTI 
(Mayers-Briggs Type Indicator)”  proposed by Katharine 
Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Mayer initiated by the Carl 
Jung theory, “Freud's Theory” developed by Sigmund Freud 
and he believed that there are three facets of the mind (id, 
ego, and superego) that contain an individual's personality 
as well as he stated that there is a relation between nurture 
and nature, “Eysenck's Personality Theory” developed by 
Eysenck in 1947 and he believed that extraversion, 
neuroticism, and psychoticism are basic traits of personality 
that reveal about personality, “Cattell's Theory” developed 
by Cattell in 1965, he revealed that there are 16 personality 
traits and completely disagreed with Eysenck theory but 
The Five-Factor model considered the best model for 
personality assessment because the five characteristics of 
the Five-Factor Model i-e Openness, Conscientiousness, 
Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism are fundamental

characteristics that build an individual's overall personality 
[4]. The Five-Factor model is one of the reliable, predictive, 
and efficient personality assessment models [5]. Nowadays 
with the advancement of the technical world, people mostly 
communicate on social media sites. The Digital generation 
spending more time on social media and every individual 
has their account on social networking sites like Twitter, 
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and the list goes on and 
on through which they communicate with each other. 
Whenever people go online they generate data through 
social media or by using their cellphones. The language 
that is used by People on social media is full of 
psychological content by using it generates a valid and fast 
personality assessment [6].In our research, we used users 
generated content to insight the personality traits of users 
without having them fill out any questionnaire. We are 
interested in words used by the users on their profiles to 
predict their personality traits. We used two different 
datasets for our work: a myPersonality dataset collected 
from Facebook (labeled data) and a Twitter dataset 
collected from user's Twitter profiles (extract 3200 tweets of 
a single user to predict their personality traits). The 
research study is presented as follows. Section 2 
demonstrates the related work. Section 3 explains the 
proposed methodology. Section 4 defines the evaluation 
metrics. Section 5 demonstrates the results of our proposed 
model. A comparison of different classification models is 
discussed in section 6.  Conclusion and Future work are 
presented in the last section.

Related Work 
Every person has a different pattern of feeling, thinking, and 
behavior that makes one's personality unique from one 
another. Numerous amount of research has been done in 
the field of personality assessment by adopting different 
classification methods, Datasets, and personality models. 
Given below is a brief overview of related work. In 2020, 
Xiao Kun Wu et al. assessed personality through Twitter 
tweets of social media users using a weighted Random 
Forest (weighted-RF) classifier. They used two datasets 
about civil rights events and compared weighted-RF with 
seven different machine learning algorithms as well as 
claimed that weighted Random Forest performed the best 
among all the other classifiers [7]. Rohit GV et al. predict 
personality using Facebook status that can be shared by 
users on their profiles. They used the BIG5 model and 
Random Forest Classifier for their research and achieved 
64.25% accuracy or 5.25 mean square error was achieved 
by using a random forest regressor [8]. In 2019, Aditi V. 
Kunte et al. used a real-time Twitter dataset for the 
personality prediction task. They used three different 
machine learning algorithms (Linear Discriminate Analysis, 
Adaboost, and Multinomial Naive Bayes). After comparing 
these three algorithms they concluded thatMultinomial 
Naive Bayes got the highest accuracy that is 73.43% [9].In 
2018, Giulio Carducci et al. Presented a supervised 
learning approach to identify personality traits through an 
individual's tweets. They used myPersonality and Twitter 
datasets for their work and word embedding used as a 
vectorizer. 
SVM 
(Support 
Vector 
Machine), 
Linear 
regression, and Lasso classification models are used and 
concluded that linear regression performs the worse [10]. K. 
Kircaburun and M. D. Griffiths explored the associations 
among personality, daily usage of the internet, self-seeking, 
and Instagram addiction. The sample size is N=752 these 
are university students who completed a survey report that 
contains FFM inventory, Instagram addiction, and self-
seeking scale. They concluded that daily usage of the 
internet was negatively related to Instagram addiction either 
self-seeking, consciousness, and agreeableness are three 
factors that were negatively related to Instagram addiction 
[11]. In 2017, Varshney et al. recognized human personality 
via analyzing their handwriting. For the analysis of the 
handwriting-based system, they used the following terms: 
margin, spacing, connections, slant, letter size, speed, 
clarity, pressure, zones, a large middle zone, small middle 
zone, and upper zone extension [12]. Gupta et al. 
contribute to the personality prediction task. For their 
research, they collected Facebook profile data like users 
name, date of birth, gender, age, qualification, marital 
status as well as Facebook activities like dislike, and posts 
to predict personality traits. The activities performed by 
every individual is essential because it reveals valuable 
insight to predict the user's concern, behavior, nature, and 
sentiments. They used the k nearest neighbor algorithm to 
train their dataset [13]. Ahmad et al. predict the personality 
traits of a Twitter user by using the DISC model. They 
extracted about one million recent tweets from Twitter and 
divide their methodology into three main steps that are data 
extraction, analysis, and visualization. They extracted the 
data using Rapidminer which is one of the best machine 
learning tools and offers multiple text processing packages. 
After extraction, analysis, and visualization they predict the 
personality traits of users [5].In 2015 Yakasai et al. examine 
the effect of FFM attributes on the performance of 
salespersons. There are three main objectives of their 
research first of all they analyze the connection among the 
attributes 
of 
FFM, 
salesperson 
performance, 
and 
salesperson purchaser orientation. Secondly, they explored 
the impact of culture on the proposed model, and Finally, 
they proposed a model on the performance of a 
salesperson as well as include the impact of client 
orientation and culture on sales performance [14]. In 2014, 
Dehghanan et al. examine the impacts of the Five-Factor 
model attributes on emotional intelligence. For this, they 
worked on a few Iranian organizations and used two 
questionnaires “McCrae and Costa questionnaire (NEO-PI-
R)” to measure the personality attributes and “Bradbury and 
Grieve questionnaire” to measure the impacts of emotional 
intelligence. They considered the five hypotheses by using 
regression and structural equation modeling and concluded 
that 
Openness, 
Consciousness, 
Extraversion, 
and 
Agreeableness affects positively on emotional intelligence 
whereas Neuroticism affectsnegatively [15].In 2013, Alam 
et al. contribute to the field of personality prediction and 
compare the performance of different classification methods 
also concluded that MNB (Multinomial Naive Bayes) 
performs better as compare to SMO (Sequential minimal 
optimization) and BLR (Bayesian Logistic Regression) [16]. 
In 2011, Golbeck et al. collected 2000 recent tweets of 
users and perform text analysis. They choose the BIG 5 
model and analyze tweets text through two methods LIWC 
(Linguistic 
Inquiry 
and 
Word 
Count) 
and 
MRC 
psycholinguistic database. When the features are obtained, 
they apply two different machine learning algorithms for 
personality prediction (Zero and Gaussian process) [17].

The scope of this paper is to predict the traits of human 
personality. Personality prediction can be used in a 
candidate's hiring process and also helps to identify 
criminals or negative-minded people. 
 
3 Methodology 
The methodology followed in this research is presented in 
figure 3, its objectives are to identify the personality scores 
of an individual by evaluating their online social media data 
and create a model for personality prediction. To build this 
model several modules are used such as Netminer, deep 
sequential neural network, and multi-target regression 
model.

3.1 Data Collection or Datasets 
For this study, two datasets are used 1) myPersonality 
dataset 2) Twitter dataset. 
 
1. myPersonality Dataset 
The myPersonality project was a Facebook application. In 
June 2007 David Stillwell has proposed it. At that time he 
was a student of Nottingham University and now a lecturer 
of Cambridge University and Michal Kosinski joined David 
Stillwell in 2009, at that time he was a student of Cambridge 
University and now a lecturer of Stanford University. In 
January 2012 it was closed due to a deficiency of time to 
continue it. During that period approximately 7.5 million 
users completed measures on my personality project. 
According to the official website of my personality project, 
there are more than 50 chapters and articles that have 
been published on it. It is free of cost and provides quality 
data [18]. It allows Facebook users to access 25 
phycological tests in which also include the Five-Factor 
model questionnaires.

For the Twitter dataset, we used the netminer tool to extract 
user's tweets. We extracted 3200 recent tweets of random 
Twitter users as well as extracted 3200 recent tweets of 
Imran khan and Bill gates to predict their personality traits. 
The figure below is a snapshot of Twitter data which 
contains 
nine 
columns 
i-e 
(tweet_id, 
created_time,twitter_screen, app, lang, hashtag, retweet_id, 
full_text, and tweetClass).

3.2 Data pre-processing 
All the textual data has been collected and save in the 
“.csv” file then undergo the next phase which is 
preprocessing for further proceedings. Preprocess the data 
through NLP(Natural Language processing). In the data 
preprocessing phase we did the following steps: 
1. 
Eliminates all data points with Null/Nan values. 
2. 
Remove all punctuation marks, special characters, and 
symbols. 
3. 
Case conversion, to lower case. 
4. 
Stopwords removal. Stop words are the most 
commonly used words (i.e. “is”, “the”, “what” etc.). They are 
useless, so we eliminate these all. 
5. 
Lemmatization, the purpose of lemmatization is 
grouping the words. Suppose there are words like enjoy, 
enjoyed, enjoying through lemmatization it should be 
considered as a single item.

Fig. 5.Data before and after pre-processing 
 
3.3 Data vectorization 
Once the data has been cleaned by eliminating null values, 
punctuation marks, special characters, symbols, and stop 
words then proceed to the next phase which is data 
vectorization. TF-IDF (Term frequency-inverse Document 
Frequency) vectorizer is used to convert the textual data 
into vectors. It assigns the frequency to words like how 
many times a single word can appear in a file/document as 
well as downscales word that appears a lot of time in a 
document. The TF (Term Frequency) can be computed by 
using the formula that is mentioned below: 
 
      
    
∑     
 
 
(1) 
Each file has its own TF (Term Frequency), which is 
computed by dividing a word that appears the number of 
times in a file by the total number of words. The IDF 
(Inverse Data Frequency) can be computed by using the 
formula that is mentioned below: 
 
             
   
  
                                
(2) 
Through IDF weight/frequency of a word can be determined 
by a log of the number of files divided by the number of files 
that have the word “a”. Finally, TF-IDF can be calculated by 
simply multiplying TF by IDF that is mentioned below: 
 
                     
   
  
(3) 
So, by this method, we identify the frequency/weight of all 
the words in a document. 
 
3.4 Model Training and Testing 
In this phase, we consider myPersonality dataset and split 
the data into training and testing(80% for training and 20% 
for testing). During this research, several machine learning 
algorithms are studied to identify the ideal model. 
Therefore, deep sequential neural networks and multi-target 
regression models are chosen for our work. Using both 
deep 
sequential 
neural 
networks 
and 
multi-target 
regression model prediction of the OCEAN or FFM traits is 
successful. Training and testing of the proposed model 
have been done on the myPersonality dataset. The model 
is trained using deep sequential neural networks and a 
multi-target regression model then a trained model is 
implemented on the Twitter dataset to predict Twitter user's 
personality traits. 
 
4 Evaluation Metrics 
The performance of the system has been measured by 
evaluation metrics in which include MSE (Mean square 
Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), Precision, Recall, F1-
score, and average precision. The following are the 
equations that can be used to compute all these mentioned 
evaluation metrics: 
 
      
 ∑     ̂   
 
   
 
(4) 
 
 
      
 ∑     ̂ 
 
   
  
(5) 
Where, 
 ̂ = Predicted Value, 
 
  = Original value, 
N= Number of observations 
 
           
             
                             
(6) 
 
Precision is the fraction of related occurrences among the 
retrieve occurrences and it is also known as positive 
predictive value. It is used to find out when the cost of a 
False Positive is high and precision is the ability of the 
classifier that doesn’t label negative samples as positive. 
 
        
             
                             
(7) 
The recall is the fraction of correctly identified occurrences 
over the total amount of relevant occurrences and it is also 
known as sensitivity.

5 Experiment and Results 
In this section, We discuss the performance and results of 
the experiments which we carried out for predicting 
personality traits of an individual based on his social media 
data. Jupyter Notebook is used as an IDE (Integrated 
Development Environment) and python is used as a 
programming language. The Netminer tool is used to 
extract Twitter data. Multi-target regression and deep 
sequential neural networks are the models used. Table 4 
shows the MSE (Mean Square Error) of the proposed 
model and the overall combined MSE is 0.20. Table 5 
shows the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of the proposed 
model and the overall combined MAE is 0.34. Table 6 
shows Precision (0.72), Recall (0.79), F1-score (0.72), 
training accuracy (94%), and testing accuracy (78%).

The above tables report the accuracy of the proposed 
model which is best among all the other machine learning 
classifiers that can be demonstrated in section 6. Since we 
have multiple outputs so we build a multi-label personality 
model. Our proposed model is consists of a fully connected 
neural network with 5 output neurons, each neuron predicts 
scores for one of each personality trait according to the BIG 
5 model. The model categorizes the words according to the 
BIG 5 model. For example, frustrated, anxiety, anger are 
the words that relate to neurotics so the proposedalgorithm 
categorized the person into five factors that are openness, 
Consciousness, 
extraversion,agreeableness, 
and 
neuroticism. The model predicts thescores that how much 
percent a person extrovert, conscious, open, agreeable, 
and neurotic. The figure given below shows the scores for 
each personality trait of Facebook data based on the BIG 5 
model.

According to the proposed model prediction, Twitter users 
have the highest scores in openness and the lowest scores 
in Neuroticism. We also predict the personality traits of Mr. 
Imran Khan and Bill gates that's why we extracted the 
recent tweets of Mr. Imran khan and Bill gates to estimate 
their personality traits.

6 Comparison 
To prove the accuracy, we compare the mean squarer error 
of different machine learning algorithms i-e Multinomial 
naive Bayes, logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes 
with the proposed model. Our proposed model has the least 
mean square error. So, its performance is much better than 
other machine learning algorithms. Table 7 compares the 
results of the mean square error of Multinomial Naive 
Bayes, Logistic regression, and Gaussian Naive Bayes with 
the proposed model.

Table 8 compares the results of the precision, recall, F1-
score, training, and testing accuracy of the proposed model 
with other traditional machine learning algorithms. After 
exploring different machine learning algorithms, Our 
proposed model using a sequential neural network and 
multi-target regression model with a TF-IDF vectorizer got 
high scores in precision, recall, F1-score as compare to 
other models. The average precision score of our proposed 
model is 72%, recall is 79%, F1-score is 72%, the training 
accuracy is 94%, and testing accuracy is 78%. It has the 
highest accuracy among all other classification models. 
 
7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In the proposed analysis, an efficient technique is 
developed to predict the personality traits of social media 
users as social media is one of the most promising 
platforms to predict human personality. Social media is a 
rich platform where people can easily express their feelings 
without any hesitation. As discussed previously, we have 
designed a multi-label personality model to predict Twitter 
users' personality traits. The algorithm of myPersonality 
data is used to train the model and a multi-target regression 
and deep sequential neural network model are used for the 
prediction. myPersonality dataset is a labeled data. To 
vectorize the data TF-IDF is used. The proposed model has 
achieved more reliable results as compared to other 
vectorizers and machine learning algorithms. Its accuracy is 
94% for the training data and 78% for the testing data, 
According to the prediction of the proposed model, most of 
the tweets are related to agreeableness and openness 
traits of the personality. People are more agreeable and 
open in their tweets. Imran Khan has the highest scores in 
openness and Bill Gates has the highest traits in 
agreeableness. The people who are related to openness 
use terms like enjoy, happy, congratulations, great, pretty, 
awesome, etc, The conscious people use the terms like 
thoughts, feeling, dying, failure, terrified, etc, The extrovert 
people use terms like party, love, sing, song, etc, and the 
agreeable people use terms such as healthy, kind listen, 
believe, etc, Finally, the neurotic people use terms like 
regret, loosing, confuse, upset, mess, etc. It is obvious from 
the literature review that there has been tremendous work 
in the field of personality assessment but it still needs more 
research as personality prediction is a broad domain. In our 
research, We are predicting human personality through text 
analysis and the work can be extended by using images, 
videos, audio content that the social media users share on 
their accounts. Apart from Twitter, there are several social 
media sites like Instagram, Youtube, Linkedlnthat can be 
used to explore personalities for the proposed technique. 
Social media users belong to different cultures and religions 
so they speak different languages, therefore the language 
barrier is one of the ultimate problems while predicting a 
user's personality.
